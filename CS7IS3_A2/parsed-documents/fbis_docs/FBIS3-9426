Here is Milan Martic's statement that we received from Knin: [Begin Martic recording] Citizens of the RSK, the current work of the republican parliament, which is primarily characterized by some political divisions and a one-sided imposition of the coalitions' stands, is leading the state into total chaos and anarchy. As president of the RSK, I will not allow this. In these exceptionally difficult times for our state, when, in addition to all the other pressures and difficulties, we are achieving significant results on the international political scene, we are encountering obstacles that are exclusively the consequence of such work by the assembly. As president of the republic and the supreme commander of the armed forces, I will not allow the RSK to become a (?battlefield) for political showdowns between political parties [word indistinct]. Citizens of the RSK, fighters, workers, and pensioners, I demand that you raise your voice to remove the obstacles caused by the work of the parliament, to reexamine the mandate you have loaned to some deputies, and to call them to account. The respected deputies must know that they have been elected by you and that they are only accountable to you and not the political leaders whose dictates they are now implementing.
