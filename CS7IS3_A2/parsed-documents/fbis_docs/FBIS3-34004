The Palestinian source added that the agreement provides for setting up a Palestinian checkpoint that receives travelers to and from the self-rule areas. An Israeli checkpoint will exercise electronic control from a distance. Travelers wishing to enter Israel will be permitted to head for the Israeli checkpoint without being intercepted. The source pointed out that the corridor linking Gaza and Jericho will pass through the nearby township of Idnah, Hebron, in the context of initial Israeli consent to let travelers from the self-rule areas cross into the West Bank. These travelers will be given enough time to cover the distance between the first Israeli checkpoint in the self-rule areas and the first Israeli checkpoint after these areas, and then proceed to the first Israeli military checkpoint in the destination area. The Palestinian source affirmed that the Davos agreement included Israeli consent to put the Palestinian authority in charge of arranging all rituals during religious seasons in the al-Nabi Musa area, which Jewish pilgrims visit three times a year. In return, Christian Palestinians will make pilgrimages under their own flag to the area of al-Maghtis [where Christ was believed to have been baptized] without being harassed or intercepted by Israel. The source added that Israel has agreed to let the national Palestinian authority extend to the Dead Sea coast and consented to the establishment of tourist resorts and economic establishments. He pointed out that the Palestinians insisted in the Davos draft of keeping control on the international borders and crossing points between Gaza and Egypt and between Jericho and Jordan. That point is still disputed. The Palestinian source concluded that this agreement might be signed in the next stage by 'Arafat and Rabin in the presence of Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Soviet Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, and the Greek foreign minister, since Greece chairs the European Union's current session.
