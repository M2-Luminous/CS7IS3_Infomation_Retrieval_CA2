Of course, in all of these reactions there may be a grain of truth and justification, and perhaps something more. But altogether they confirm the following pessimistic observation: If the winners are still a long way from providing all the reassurances demanded of them, the losers are even further away from correctly identifying the nature of their adversaries and of what kind of opposition they intend to carry out. Berlusconi faced three problems. The first was how to make apparent the characteristics -- liberal in politics and derestrictive in economics -- of the change of course that his government intends to impart to the country; and on the whole he has succeeded brilliantly in this, at least in principle. As for the specific feasibility of the objectives indicated and the paths proposed for attaining them, we can only agree with what the prime minister has asked, namely, that the government be judged on the basis of its deeds, not on the basis of preconceptions. This, even though -- and this really is no minor consideration -- we still refuse to regard as a prejudice or, worse, as a restriction of the political rights of a citizen and businessman, the demand, -- with regard to which Berlusconi still remained rather vague, to say the least -- for guarantees that will immediately dispel even the suspicion of confusion between the public interest and private interests. Berlusconi's second, and more difficult, problem was how to provide the Italian and international public with strong reassurances of the democratic reliability of a majority and a government of which Northern League and especially postfascist ministers are authoritative members. With regard to the League members, what benefited Berlusconi even more than his remarks about the unity and indivisibility of the Italy of the 100 cities and the "respect and interest" to be granted to the "debate on federalism" was [League ideologue] Miglio's sudden divorce -- by no means by mutual consent -- from [League Secretary] Bossi who, according to the League's octogenarian enfant terrible, is guilty of having sold the federalist revolution for a mess of pottage. The problem of the National Alliance is of a different and thornier kind. Especially the day after the shameful and intolerable skinhead demonstration in Vicenza, it was truly justifiable to expect some clearer and more incisive remarks from the prime minister on the subject of fascism and antifascism. This, partly and, we are inclined to say, above all, in order to grant the proper prominence to the most convincing aspect of Berlusconi's argument, that concerning the necessity and advisability of proceeding along the path of the complete "constitutionalization of extremes" if we really do intend to create a proper two-party system in Italy too. This in fact leads onto the third problem that Berlusconi had to tackle: how to demand from the opposition forces full legitimization to govern for himself, his majority, and his government. Though "the difference of historical assessments of the past" with regard to fascism is not exactly a matter of academic debate, and even though the League remains an unruly ally, to say the least, on the whole Berlusconi found the right words to achieve this. It will not be easy for the Left -- assuming that it aspires to win the next contest to govern the country -- to maintain the ambiguity of, on the one hand, promising combative democratic opposition while, on the other hand, portraying itself as the champion of freedom in jeopardy. It will be even less easy for the Center opposition, assuming that it does not intend to form an appendage of the Left, to ignore the issue with which Berlusconi is directly confronting it, namely, that of permitting this government, which lacks a majority in the Senate, to be put to the test. This, without granting it any political blank checks or jeopardizing its own votes. Far be it from us to suggest any particular tactic to the various forces. But the prospect of a government that governs and of opposition forces that engage in opposition seems to us the most realistic and desirable. Certainly much more realistic and much more desirable -- for everyone -- than the risky prospect of another election or of messy pseudo-institutional muddles that would follow the Senate's failure to approve the government. At least as far as it was in his power to do so, despite all the shortcomings of his speech, Berlusconi does not seem to have made such a prospect any more remote. Certainly, Berlusconi's show of flexibility would have been more convincing if the majority had not recently attempted such rash moves as that in connection with the chairmanship of the Senate committee on authorizations to initiate legal proceedings. It is to be hoped that words are matched by deeds.
