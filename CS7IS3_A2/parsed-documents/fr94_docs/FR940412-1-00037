(c) In order to afford each Association flexibility to establish ledger and subsidiary accounts to meet its individual needs, a minimum number of accounts are prescribed in the Uniform System of Accounts. Each Association, in maintaining its accounting records, must use the prescribed chart of accounts. If additional accounts are necessary, the new accounts must be consistent with the prescribed chart of accounts classification. §403.115 System of accounts coding.

(a) The general books of account and all books, records, and supporting memoranda shall be maintained in such manner as to provide, at any time, full information relating to any account.

(b) Each Association shall maintain all records necessary to show the history of, or facts regarding, each accounting or financial transaction. These records include but are not limited to, organization tables and charts, internal accounting manuals and revisions, minutes books, stock books, reports, cost distributions and other accounting work sheets, correspondence, and memoranda. (c) Each Association shall maintain all books, records and memoranda in a manner that will readily permit audit and examination by the Director or the Director's representatives at any time. All books, records and memoranda shall be protected from loss, theft, or damage by fire, flood or otherwise, and shall be retained for 10 years unless otherwise authorized by the Director. §403.125 Accounting entities.

Questions concerning accounts or reports required by this part should be submitted to the Director. §403.135 Address for reports and correspondence.

(a) Each Association subject to this part shall maintain its accounts on a calendar year basis unless otherwise approved by the Director.

Charges shall be made against income and accruals made for only those liabilities for which a definitely demonstrable obligation exists. Where a definite obligation has been incurred and the precise liability has not been determined, an estimate may be made of the currently existing liability on such actuarial or other bases as can be justified from available information, provided that balances are reevaluated and adjusted at least once each accounting year. §403.215 Federal income tax accruals. (a) All income taxes shall be accrued by proportionate charges or credits to income each accounting period in such manner as will allocate the charges for taxes, or the tax credits for losses, to the periods in which the related profits or losses respectively, are reflected. (b) The accrual of income taxes for each accounting period requires that each Association take up in its accounts an amount equivalent to the actual tax liability applicable to the period as computed or estimated on the basis of income tax laws and regulations then in effect, except where the Association computes depreciation for tax purposes at rates which differ from straight-line depreciation based upon the estimated life of the asset.
