Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim said the opposition was made because it is not proper to link trade with human rights issues. Malaysia's stand has been consistent in that from the start it had maintained that there should be no connection between trade and human rights issues. He told newsmen this in Kuala Lumpur. Datuk Sri Anwar, who is also finance minister, was commenting on the United States decision to renew the Most Favored Nation, MFN, status for China. President Bill Clinton, in announcing the decision, said the policy of linking the annual renewal of the MFN with improved human rights should no longer be practiced. Datuk Sri Anwar said Malaysia welcomes Clinton's decision because this is consistent with Malaysia's stand that trade should not be linked with human rights issues.
