We hope that this map will be followed by others to fill in the gaps in Albanian cartography. We know that every map, in addition to the subject matter which it treats, also has a political influence. For example, in the bookstores of Skopje, Macedonians were selling their maps which included all of Lake Ohrid and two lakes in Prespa. But the Greeks are producing, and even bringing into Albania maps on which their border extends as far as Lake Shkumbi. The road map was prepared and published this year. Therefore, it is unexplainable why the name of the state to the north and northeast of Albania continues to be listed as "Yugoslavia," when it is known that the republic of Kosova has been recognized by the Albanian parliament. The presentation on our geographic maps of the places of residence of Albanians is a patriotic necessity. Today, when a number of states are taking action for the defense of Kosovo, we should be doing more. Concretely, the road map published by the Army Topographical Institute should include all of Kosovo. Indeed, Cameria [part of southern Albania which is under Greek rule] should also be included in a map of all the Albanian lands. In the mileage tables, there is no reason why the distance to Pristina, Gjakovo, Tetovo, or Filati should not be shown. The republic of Macedonia has been recognized by the Albanian state but the map published by Albanians in Tirana ignores this name! Thanks to democracy, Albanians now move freely and do business outside the Balkans. The maps could show the routes which they could take and give comparative mileage. As soon as possible, maps should be published for foreign businessmen and tourists. A prepublication review would improve their content and appearance.
