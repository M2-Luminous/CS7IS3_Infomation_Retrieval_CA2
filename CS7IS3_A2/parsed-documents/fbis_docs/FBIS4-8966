After his program, Imre Konya gave an interview to UJ MAGYARORSZAG. [Petan] Mr. Konya! In view of the presentation of candidates, in your opinion, to what extent will the national forces scatter? [Konya] No doubt, it is dangerous that there are parties, like Jozsef Torgyan and Istvan Csurka's parties, that can take votes away from the MDF with their radical formulations against the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. Because they will hardly be able to exceed the 5 percent threshold, they will actually give their votes to those against whom they are taking a stand. After the presentation of candidates, one can conclude that there is less danger in connection with the Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP], because they failed to present candidates in many counties, and this means that they will definitely remain under the 5 percent threshold. Therefore, whoever votes for them will actually support the other side. [Petan] The prime minister has repeatedly stressed recently that it is impossible to envisage any talks with the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] as long as a tough core leads this party. What if the hard core is forced out of the leadership? [Konya] I do not think it is tactful to engage in speculations regarding the internal affairs of another party. It is a fact that there is a border line, because the SZDSZ made it clear that they do not regard a coalition with the MSZP as impossible. For us, however, it is clear that we will not form a coalition with the MSZP under any circumstances. At the same time, I would also like to say that, among the current SZDSZ deputies, there are people who cannot envisage a coalition government with the MSZP, and I know these people. Let me also say that, in the course of the elections, the voters should not rely on their emotions. A decision must be made. The coming years will tell whether we can realize our opportunities and catch up with the West. There is no time for jumping back and forth, and there is no time for changing governments around. Therefore, what is at stake in these elections is whether we can continue on the road we have started or whether we turn back. MDF or MSZP? Those who are afraid should be told that everyone goes into the voting booth alone and the elections are secret. I hope that the healthy instinct of the nation will prevail if everyone goes to vote. One cannot imagine that people would vote against their own interests. [Petan] What is your opinion about the order of the Finance Ministry according to which, beginning with 1 May, everyone who enters Hungary must show that he possesses 5,000 forints or an equivalent sum in hard currency? This regulation affects many poor Transylvanians and ethnic Hungarians living beyond our borders who do not come here to trade goods or do any business.... [Konya] It is difficult to find a balance between the interests of the public security of the country and the border areas and keeping contact with these people. Obviously, we will not introduce a visa requirement for public security reasons, but the situation requires certain measures. It is unfortunate that contacts between people become more difficult as a result; therefore, we are constantly following the developments and we will stop this new requirement as soon as the situation makes this possible.
