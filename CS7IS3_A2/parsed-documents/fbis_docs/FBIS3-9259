Since the two world wars started in Europe, and the Cold War between NATO and the Warsaw Pact was most palpable in Europe, in 1973 the CSCE was founded in Helsinki to prevent possible cataclysms. Ever since, the CSCE member-countries (the European countries, the United States, and Canada) have been working systematically to strengthen mutual trust by solving problems in three domains (security, economics, and humanitarian aid). Without diminishing the importance of the last two, security is still the most important, because it clearly puts member-countries under an obligation to observe the established principles with regard to international affairs, particularly in terms of supplying information and making it possible to view the condition and activities of their armed forces. Intense negotiations on disarmament were crowned by the Vienna Document in 1990, by which Soviet military dominance (and power) in Europe was eliminated. Before that, at the CSCE meeting in Paris (from 19 to 21 March 1990) the Charter for a New Europe was adopted, which announces the cessation of the Cold War and presents the conceptual arrangement of future relations in Europe. The violent disintegration of former Yugoslavia and a war whose end is still not in sight best show to what extent the CSCE member-countries have stuck to the Charter (it does not anticipate the possibility of war breaking out). The dynamics and character of the political and military processes in Europe in the course of 1990 created the illusion that finally a time of peace and well-being had come about. However, some significant facts were overlooked, which warned of the evidently misjudged situation. The facts are: Nobody mentioned that NATO should be dissolved, although there was no more need for its existence; NATO was rejoicing over victory against its main opponent, that is, the Warsaw Pact, and ignoring the warning of a USSR official that something horrible would come about with the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact -- NATO would remain without an enemy; the Warsaw Pact member-countries naively believed that they would be swamped with the capital of the rich West; German unification was underestimated, while some vital goals and interests of Russia were disregarded. Therefore, inexplicably, the role of the CSCE since 1990 has been pushed into the background. There is a good chance that NATO might take up the role of the CSCE, because the steps that are being taken these days point to that possibility quite clearly. Of course, that possibility has primarily to do with the expansion of NATO, which is the plan that NATO is trying to camouflage with the "Partnership for Peace" project. Many facts indicate that it will be a cause of more discord in Europe rather than peace. The essence is in the following: NATO was formed to keep the Russians out of, the Americans in, and the Germans subdued in Europe. The first task has been accomplished, but the second and the third are still facing many difficulties, the cause of which is to be found in the smoldering rivalry between the former boss, NATO (or rather the United States), and the new rival, Germany. These two, guided by the knowledge that the open rivalry between them at an inconvenient moment might have a negative effect on NATO's cohesion, have opted for a detour, which is to say, they are trying to preserve the Alliance (the United States), and to ascend to a dominant position (Germany) at the expense of the Eastern European countries, and in such a way to postpone the moment of direct confrontation. Consequently, under the pretext that NATO wants to help its former enemies, the United States and Germany have started a massive humanitarian mission in the East, of course only to accomplish their own goals and interests. Even this covert conflict may have a certain negative impact on NATO's cohesion. However, there is no doubt that the Eastern European peoples will be the ones who will eventually suffer and pay the highest price. And what has actually happened? Just as in the past, the aggressive Germans have shown their proneness to hasty actions. By putting pressure on the European Community and the United States to recognize unconditionally the forceful secession of Slovenia, Croatia, and thereafter the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, Germany scored the first points among the allies. Of course, with that Germany only announced its global aspirations. They became evident in 1993, when Germany signed agreements on military cooperation with Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and the former Soviet Baltic republics. The fact that German military circles make decisions on all the important questions regarding the system of defense and the armed forces of the Czech Republic is a reliable indicator of what kind of agreements that it is all about (partnership should mean reciprocity). Such colonial-like successes of Germany in the East have caused skepticism on the part of the United States, while patriotic forces in Russia have felt that as a direct offense. A reaction ensued in a flash. The United States decided to legalize their colonial interests in some former socialist countries by launching the Partnership for Peace project, in which all the NATO member-countries are supposed to take part, and to act as a monolith, while it is well known that in Albania it is solely the U.S. advisers who have been placed at all levels of the Albanian state administration, and that important political decisions must not be made without their approval. It is naive to think, let alone believe, that the United States and Germany can accept former socialist countries as equal partners in decision-making, be it with regard to military issues, or any other issues. The attitude that the partners will have a right to consult with NATO on whether there is a direct or indirect danger to their security shows more than clearly that the Partnership has nothing to do with partnership, but rather with the typical U.S. patronage toward former enemies. Moreover, how NATO assesses whether the security of their partners is endangered, and to what extent, can be seen in the following: The fact that every fourth Russian voter voted for Zhirinovsky, while every seventh voted for the Communist Party, is reportedly a very great danger that threatens Russia. However, despite this and other alarming facts, the former Warsaw Pact member-countries (in the so-called neuralgic zone) are still naively hoping that the NATO countries (the zone of prosperity) will accept them as equal partners and make fair plans for their future. The implementation of this project, which was started without a clear vision of what the future European defense system should be like, will probably exact a very high price. Who will pay that price is hard to say at this moment. However, the determination of the main rivals within NATO to involve the former enemies in their struggle for power and dominance within the Alliance is already giving hints to whom the bill will be delivered. Therefore it is wrong to expect that such a process will have a positive impact on European security. It is more probable that Europe will be thrown back to the time when it was the arena in which world wars were triggered. Is not the NATO ultimatum to the Serbian republic a good enough argument for that?
