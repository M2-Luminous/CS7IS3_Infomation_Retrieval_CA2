We owe this to the work done by the experts, Russian experts on one side and European experts on the other. We also owe it to the political will expressed by yourself, President Yeltsin, and by the 12 members of the European Union [EU]. This agreement includes acts of the past and gives them a more functional and fuller framework that will result in the prospect for a zone of free exchanges. It will facilitate exchanges of European businesses in Russia and to this I add the signature of the European Charter for energy. I believe that, in this way, many new possibilities will open for Russia with its tremendous natural resources. This agreement allows for exchange in many sectors and services, it is really an innovation. Finally, I believe that within the framework of this agreement we will be able to develop our scientific cooperation, to use with our own resources the (?excellent) resources that you have in the field of science [words indistinct] and in the field toward cooperation and peace. I believe that this agreement is a very good framework. Of course, this agreement also includes the possibility for close partnership in the political sector, (?regular) consultations between yourself and the representatives of the 12 member states and 16 [words indistinct] members of the EU. Finally, through this agreement, Russia--which was, is, and will remain, an important power--will be able to play its role fully in our continent, at this end of Asia and the Pacific Ocean. I would also like say a few words about the Russian people. The Russian people have followed a road full of obstacles and difficulties. Difficulties for the deepening of democracy, difficulties in reaching an open and competitive economy. However, in the past, the Russian people have shown so many possibilities of overcoming these difficulties and I am certain that they will succeed in this difficult task. I would also like you to allow me to convey, through you, this thought to the Russian people who today are even nearer to us because this agreement includes a great political significance. Thanks to this agreement Russia, as a large power, will be able to enter the 21st century. Thank you.
