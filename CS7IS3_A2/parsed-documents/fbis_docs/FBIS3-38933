The decision Turkey made to change the engines and transmission units of the BTR-60 vehicles, which are used in southeastern Turkey, was made only six months after the vehicles were put into service. Consequently, the decision to buy Russia's BRT-80 armored vehicles adds to Ankara's string of wrong decisions. Meanwhile, Turkey has also reached an agreement with Russia to buy 19 MI-27 general purpose helicopters. The preliminary agreements for the purchase of Russia's armored vehicles and helicopters were concluded when Lieutenant General Teoman Ekan, under secretary of the Ministry of National Defense, visited Russia in January. The cost of the armored vehicles and helicopters was also established in the talks Erkan held with the officials in Russia. Turkey will pay $1,650,000 for the armored vehicles and $65 million for the helicopters. The agreements will be signed when Minister of National Defense Mehmet Golhan visits that country. Recalling that the BTR-80 vehicles have diesel engines, several arms experts have said that a very important factor has been overlooked. Stressing that the BRT-80's will be used against the Kurdish Workers Party militants in southeastern Turkey, they noted that they are very wide and cumbersome vehicles with limited maneuvering capability. Meanwhile, the question of how successful the Turkish pilots will be in Russian-made helicopters, which are not as advanced as the helicopters manufactured by the Western countries, has prompted anxiety. The experts have stressed that the technology used in Russian-made helicopters and the supply of spare parts may create a problem in the future. [passage omitted]
