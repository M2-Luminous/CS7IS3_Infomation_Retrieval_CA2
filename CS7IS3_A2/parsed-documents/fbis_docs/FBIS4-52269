In January-March, Korean shipbuilders received orders for 1,011,000 tons at 1.2 billion U.S. dollars, amounting to 1,196 dollars per tonnage. Japanese shipbuilders received orders for 2,969,000 tons at 3.06 billion dollars for 1,032 dollars per tonnage. With orders received in April added, Korean shipbuilders posted 1,299 dollars per tonnage in the first four months, while the data for Japanese shipbuilders in April are not available yet. Korean shipbuilders, who secured enough orders for the coming two years already last year, have sought to win relatively more profitable orders since the turn of the year, while their Japanese competitors have employed a low-price strategy. At the price per tonnage, Korea topped Japan by 837 dollars to 704 dollars in 1990; however, Korea lagged behind Japan with 1,023 dollars to 1,130 dollars in 1991, and with 1,143 dollars to 1,513 dollars in 1992. Last year, Korean shipbuilders received orders for 9,519,000 tons at 7.35 billion dollars for 772 dollars compared with 1,231 dollars for Japanese shipbuilders.
