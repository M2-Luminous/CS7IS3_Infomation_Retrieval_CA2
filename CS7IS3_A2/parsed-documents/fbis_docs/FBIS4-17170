Parliament Chairman Konstantin Maksimov Hopes for Assistance from Moscow" -- place, date not given] [Text] [Borboyev] Konstantin Nikolayevich, at what stage of resolution is the problem of rehabilitation of the Kalmyk people? [Maksimov] I would like to single out three points in President Yeltsin's edict on rehabilitation of the Kalmyk people and on state support for its revival and development, signed at the end of last year. Kalmykia officials are working closely with the federal authorities in addressing these problems. Approximately 40 billion rubles from the Russian budget is needed to pay material compensation to those who suffered from repression, as well as members of their families. We find understanding in Moscow, and I think that before the end of the year the problem will be fully resolved. [Borboyev] Does the republic itself envision any measures to compensate for the people's physical and moral losses? [Maksimov] Yes, certainly. Our republic's president deems it essential to reduce the pensionable age for approximately 30,000 persons who were formerly repressed. Our proposal on making additions to the Russian Law On State Pensions in the Russian Federation is currently being studied by federal bodies. The first volume of the Book of Memory (overall there will be two) has come out, which includes the names of all representatives of the Kalmyk people who died during the years of deportation. The republic's authorities are grateful to workers of the archives and libraries in Stavropol and Krasnoyarsk Krays, Astrakhan, Rostov, Volgograd, and a number of other oblasts who have shown understanding and preserved elements of spiritual, cultural, and religious values. This year the property of the Kalmyk people outside the republic will be returned. [Borboyev] Will these benefits be extended to Kalmyks living outside the republic? [Maksimov] Yes, this is envisioned by our legislative enactments because approximately 30,000 representatives of the Kalmyk people live in krays and oblasts of the Russian Federation, in particular in Siberia where they were deported illegally but by the will of fortune have stayed there up till now. [Borboyev] How topical at present are Kalmykia's territorial claims, in particular on the neighboring Astrakhan Oblast? [Maksimov] Our authorities have always -- before as well as after perestroyka -- been raising the question about the territories of Limannskiy and Dolbanskiy Rayons of Kalmykia which were illegally transferred to our neighbors. These are good pasture lands which could benefit the republic greatly. The problem remains, but at the present period we are for a moratorium on revising territorial borders. At the same time approximately 400,000 hectares of so- called "black" soil is leased from the republic by Dagestan and Astrakhan Oblast. And whereas a leasing agreement was reached with Dagestan last year, none has been made with Astrakhan Oblast so far. I consider it necessary to monitor the condition of our lands at the state level.
