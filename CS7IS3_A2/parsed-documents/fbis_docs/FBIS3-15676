It could have been considered a solution to the crisis if it were not for one most significant circumstance: Holding such elections would confirm that the Georgian jurisdiction does not apply to some regions. We believe that dissolving parliament contradicts the interests of Georgia because parliament is the only legitimate body confirming Georgia's unity. Therefore, the parliamentary majority goes out of its way for retaining the executive legislative body of Georgia. Unfortunately, the parliamentary opposition is behaving in quite an opposite way. Some representatives of the opposition systematically resort to threats, blackmail, and insults which becomes unbearable. Therefore, the population thinks that parliament must be dissolved. Proceeding from the interests of the country, it is crucial that we find ways for coexistence between the majority and the opposition. Meanwhile, we declare that we shall react lawfully to all instances of insult to personal honor. [Signed] The council of the parliamentary majority. [Dated] Tbilisi, 8 March, 1994.
