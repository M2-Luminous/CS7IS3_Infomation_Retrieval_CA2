The March figure, which will be released by the State Statistical Bureau (SSB) next week, is slightly lower than February's but higher than January's, giving a first quarter average of 24.6 percent. Prices in some cities -- including Chongqing, Beijing, Haikou and Guangzhou -- are expected to show rises of more than 30 percent in March. Shanghai has already reported a figure of 38 percent over the first three months of the year. The national picture, to be revealed later in the month, looks even worse, SSB sources said. The bureau expects the national cost of living to rise between 24 and 25 percent for March compared with 22.3 percent over the first two months of the year. Although considered by Beijing to be less important to social stability than the urban figure, the national rate is used for planning and reflects Beijing's failure to harness the runaway economy since macroeconomic control measures were imposed last July. Beijing's pledge to hold national inflation to within 10 percent this year after a 13 percent rise in 1993 looks doubtful. National retail prices, meanwhile, will show a rise to about 22-23 percent, compared with 20 percent over the first two months, the SSB predicts. SSB officials warned that inflationary pressure was likely to remain high through the second quarter of the year. "We told the government that tighter administrative controls are crucial to containing this momentum until the economy begins to slow down," an SSB official said. The figures will appear as seven national inspection teams sent out by the State Council on April 1 begin their double-pronged attack on inflation by cracking down on price gouging and chaotic fixed investment. Beating inflation emerged as Beijing's priority after last month's meeting of the National People's Congress [NPC] when the official China News Service described price rises as "part of China's present-day social agony". In the clearest signal of Beijing's concern, a vice-premier, Li Lanqing, told the NPC: "If prices cannot be controlled, popular feelings and stability will be affected and reform cannot be carried out." Since then, city mayors have been regularly asked by Beijing to explain their cities' high inflation. The Shanghai party secretary, Wu Bangguo, told an NPC meeting that he had been embarrassed by the Premier Li Peng, who was more informed about prices of consumer goods in the city than either he or its mayor, Huang Ju. Plans to free prices on a range of goods in many cities this year -- from staple foods to bus fees -- have been put on hold since prices began to rise. Inflation in China's leading cities was 19.6 percent last year, the highest rate since 1988, when panic buying of consumer goods forced Beijing to implement a credit squeeze that sidelined the economy for two years. The run-up in the "hot summer of 1988" is also considered a factor that helped precipitate the student-led Tiananmen protests the following spring.
