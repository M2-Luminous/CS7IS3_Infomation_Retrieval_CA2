Deputy Governor Simon Hernandez has told PAGINA/12 that the commitments that were assumed under Decree 349, signed by President Carlos Menem and Labor Minister Armando Caro Figueroa, "will entail no dismissals." However, a great many of the 23,000 provincial public servants are expected to be transferred through the sale of public enterprises. The decree sets forth that the improvement of the province's fiscal and financial situation and the structural reform of the public sector will be implemented "in keeping with the economic policy guidelines that the national government has adopted on the subject." In this regard the Economy Ministry will in the next few hours transfer Treasury bonds for a nominal value of 70 million pesos (the difference with the figure that the province will actually receive stems from the actual value of the bonds). Acting Governor Hernandez -- Governor Arnaldo Castillo is on vacation -- said that the nation's contribution "was the condition we imposed for signing the fiscal pact. Another requirement that the Economy Ministry is fulfilling is the implementation of an investment program for 120 million pesos. [passage omitted]
