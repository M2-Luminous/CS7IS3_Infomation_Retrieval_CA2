FBIS3-6398 "dreas051_d_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-051 Document Type:Daily Report 16 Mar 1994 South Korea Papers React to IAEA Inspections of DPRK SK1603111594 SK1603111594 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular newspapers on 16 March carry articles and editorials on the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) recent inspections of North Korean nuclear facilities. The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 3 a 700-word editorial entitled "North Korea's Hindrance During the Nuclear Inspection." The editorial says: If the IAEA's judgment that its current inspection activities were "not sufficient" due to North Korea's hindrance turns out to be true, and if the alleged report that North Korea refused the IAEA inspection team access to the radiochemical laboratory is true, and that some seals in the laboratory were found to be destroyed is true this is "a grave problem" and shows that there is a possibility that North Korea might have converted its nuclear materials for military purposes. The editorial also analyzes that the reasons for North Korea's acceptance of the IAEA's inspection this time were to avoid sanctions by the UN Security Council and to use its nuclear card in its diplomatic bargaining with the United States by turning the issue of inspecting two undeclared sites over to the U.S.-DPRK high-level talks. The editorial then urges North Korea to show sincerity in the on-going North-South level contact for the exchange of top- level special envoys, stressing the need for the IAEA to refer the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council and for the governments of the ROK and the United States to resume the Team Spirit exercise if North Korea fails to carry out the preconditions that the two government have put forth. The editorial concludes by saying that in view of North Korea's recent attitude, it is almost impossible to expect momentous changes in its attitude. Additionally, SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 4 a 1,000-word article by reporter Yang Sung-hyon analyzing the results of the just ended IAEA inspection. The article notes the ROK Government assessment of the IAEA's inspection, quoting a high-ranking government official as saying: "the IAEA's inspection seems to be satisfactory from a quantitative viewpoint," but it "does not seem to be satisfactory from a qualitative viewpoint." However, the article notes the IAEA inspection team's failure to collect sample materials from the radiochemical laboratory as well as IAEA and U.S. Government officials' negative assessments of the inspection results. Noting that a final report on the inspection results will be released three to four weeks from now, the article says that if the continuity of safeguards is confirmed in the report or if North Korea's conversion of nuclear materials to military purposes is discovered, a special IAEA Board of Governors meeting will be automatically held regardless of whether or not the ROK and U.S. Governments want and, accordingly, the issue of imposing sanctions against North Korea will be discussed at the UN Security Council. In conclusion, the article analyzes that the IAEA will conclude the current inspection at the present stage because it does not want the third round of the U.S.-DPRK talks to be broken up and that it will, accordingly, assume the attitude that the North Korean nuclear issue should be settled at the U.S.-North Korean talks. The moderate HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 5 a 1,200-word article on the prospects of the nuclear issue after the North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman's warning that North Korea may stop cooperating with IAEA inspections. The article reports that the government analyzes that North Korea's response is to utter in advance that it "could not keep the promise made in the (25 February) agreement because the United States is demanding the exchange of special envoys which is not in the agreement." The article speculates that because there can be no flexibility in the policy to have the special envoy exchange first despite North Korea's warning, the nuclear issue has to go back to the point before the 25 February agreement, and North Korea will have to try to negotiate with the United States again for the third round of talks and the ROK and the United States will have to discuss anew international sanctions on North Korea. The article adds, however, that time is not on North Korea's side this time because the IAEA will hurry to have a special Board of Governors meeting and speed up discussions on referring the issue to the United Nations. The article reports a "positive reverse" is also possible if North Korea agrees to postpone the third-round U.S.-North Korea talks. The article continues that some ROK and U.S. commentators expect the third-round talks in mid-April because it will be difficult for North Korea to ignore the benefit from extending a one-time invitation to the ROK special envoy to Pyongyang. The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "Urging a Firm Stance on North Korea's Nuclear Card." Referring to the "unsuccessful" IAEA inspections, the editorial warns that North Korea is only hurrying itself to become an international orphan saying that "having the seals broken is no different from asking the nuclear issue to be referred to the UN Security Council." The editorial also warns that it is a mistake if North Korea thinks it is better to deal with the United Nations than the IAEA. The editorial points out ROK "mistakes of appeasement" and misinterpreting the "full-scope inspection" by which North Korea meant to open seven declared facilities, not unlimited inspections on all of its nuclear facilities. The editorial urges both U.S. and ROK Governments to take a firm and resolute stance on the nuclear issue by announcing the resumption of the Team Spirit exercise.
