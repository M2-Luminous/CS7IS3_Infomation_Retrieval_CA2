FR941019-2-00109 FR941019-2-00074 INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION [Finance Docket No. 32584] Caldwell County Railroad Company_Lease, Operation, and Acquisition Exemption_Norfolk Southern Railway Company Caldwell County Railroad Company (CCR), a noncarrier, has filed a notice of exemption for the lease, operation, and possible future acquisition of a rail line 1 currently owned by the Norfolk Southern (NS) and leased and operated by the Carolina & Northwestern Railroad, Inc. (C&NW). 2 The line extends from milepost HG&hyph;90.0 at Hickory, NC, to milepost HG&hyph;112.7 at Valmead, NC, a distance of approximately 22.7 miles. The lease transaction was expected to be consummated on or after September 24, 1994. 1 The Caldwell County Economic Development Commission (CCEDC) is currently negotiating with NS for the purchase of the line. Should CCEDC be successful in its efforts to acquire the line, it has agreed in principle to extend to CCR an option to purchase the subject rail property. Both CCEDC's acquisition of the NS line and CCR's exercise of its option to acquire the line from CCEDC, should it be formalized, would require subsequent Commission approval or exemption. To the extent that the notice of exemption relates to the future purchase of the subject NS line, it is rejected. 2 The transaction is to be implemented pursuant to an agreement entered into by NS, C&NW, and CCR under which the C&NW lease to operate the NS line is to be assigned to CCR. Under these circumstances, C&NW will not be required to seek Commission approval to terminate operations over the line. This proceeding is related to Donald J. and Carol N. McGrady_Continuance in Control Exemption_Caldwell County Railroad Company, Finance Docket No. 32585, wherein Donald J. and Carol N.

This notice is filed under 49 CFR 1150.31. If the notice contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio . Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not automatically stay the transaction. Decided: October 13, 1994.
