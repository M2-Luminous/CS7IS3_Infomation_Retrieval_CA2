As soon as the banking system in Russia really adapts to the market economy and assumes civilized features, the economic reforms will be set in motion. This is the opinion of the author of the article published below, who in the recent past was deputy chairman of the Central Bank of Russia and is now deputy chairman of the All-Russian Exchange Bank, Vladimir Petrovich Rasskazov. How should the banking system be in our country? Recently the newspaper BIZNES I BANKI ran a well-researched article which contains an answer to this question (A.V. Molchanov and A.M. Tavasiyev, "The Banking System of Russia: What Should It Be?", BIZNES I BANKI No. 2, 1994). The article's authors sketch out the basic features of the banking system toward whose creation we should strive, perceiving it as having two levels with a certain amount of specialization of sublevels. They also indicate the requirements for individual parts of this system. While fully supporting the concept presented there, I would like to touch upon several important aspects of our banking future. In order for the banking system, like the state of which it is a part, to be monolithic, it must have a foundation that can bring all of its parts together into a unified whole. Such a foundation--the financial-monetary system--of course, is unified, with a unified currency, and unified rules of the game pertaining to money. And these rules can only be established by the Central Bank--the sole regulator of the system. If everything is more or less comprehensible regarding commercial banks as parts of a unified system, in my view there are many problems with the Central Bank. Let us begin with the fact that the Central Bank has 85 of its own administrative entities in various areas and regions of the country. And this means that the Central Bank is practically uncontrollable. Therefore significant changes are needed here. Why not do this, for example: Have the main branch of the Central Bank in Moscow and a maximum of 9-12 regional branches, each of which, in turn, would have direct jurisdiction over 8-12 subregional branches--according to the principle of the Sovnarkhozes [Soviets of People's Commissars] of Khrushchev's time. Incidentally, the Federal Reserve System of the United States was built according to this principle. As for the apparatus of the Central Bank, it can be cut by at least half--because its structures are poorly controlled as well. They are bloated with auxiliary personnel, they have a tendency toward further growth, and there is a duplication of control and management functions. Today our Central Bank has not yet ceased to be remind one of a former branch of the USSR Gosbank [State Bank]. We must prohibit it from directly extending credit to financed entities. Yet to this day the Central Bank has an investment administration. It should not have such subdivisions--after all, the Central Bank should engage in refinancing commercial banks. If the state decides to build something or implement some large program, the Central Bank should issue special-purpose credit to the state or transfer these funds to commercial banks, and they will do the direct investing. But since the Central Bank issues credit, it should have a powerful organ controlling the activity of commercial banks. And here is where conflicts arise between the Central Bank and the commercial banks. The latter do not like it when somebody carefully oversees them. Recently, for example, the leaders of one well-known bank stated that they would not allow anybody from the outside into their bank, including representatives of the Central Bank. This, of course, is wrong because our Central Bank, like central emission banks throughout the world, has every right and obligation to oversee the commercial banks with respect to any aspects of their activity. How else could it be? When the Central Bank grants permission for the opening of a commercial bank, how can it tell its future clients that, having decided to open this bank, it takes responsibility for it and therefore they can invest money in it without worrying. And if the Central Bank acts as the guarantor of the commercial bank, it must know everything about it. Protection of confidential information received by the Central Bank from the commercial bank is another matter--here the parties must reach some kind of agreement between themselves. In any case, this can be regulated today. With all the achievements in the regulation of relations among the parties, dissension among them will not cease until there is a law directly regulating these relations. I have in mind a so-called bank act which defines the problem of banking secrets and the nature and procedure whereby commercial banks convey information to the Central Bank. In other words, this document must determine the entire policy for overseeing the activity of commercial banks and all procedures for relations among the parties. In my view, it would not be out of place to create such a legislative document regulating relations between commercial banks and their clients as well. Only then will the Central Bank become a guarantor of the protection of the rights of clients, including the right reimbursement for damages caused to them. And the Central Bank, of course, must have special insurance funds and reserves in the event that the commercial banks go bankrupt. That is, these funds could guarantee the operation of the entire banking system. And no commercial bank could even think of encroaching on these funds. Moreover, the Central Bank, like the commercial banks, must bear responsibility if there are cases of "laundering" of money used in criminal activity. And all this should be backed by legislation. As concerns the credit-monetary policy, I see the main tasks here as implementing it through the establishment of norms for reserves, liquidity, currency regulation, the discount rate for centralized credit (and it should be at least higher than the rates of inflation at any given moment) and others. As one of the authors of banking legislation, the Central Bank must establish these norms for commercial banks, and in order to control them effectively it must have feedback in the form of statistical information. Consequently, the country's main bank must constantly be gathering and generalizing statistics on the banks, which at the same time will serve as a basis for management of the national economy. Central Bank statistics are the most precise and accurate figures with valuation in rubles. Incidentally, the Central Bank should introduce centralized norms for banking statistics, since sooner or later Russian banking institutions will have to "merge" into the world banking system. Of course, this must be preceded by a transition to unified international bookkeeping standards. And it is still just being started, but even now we have a strange picture: Each commercial bank has its own plan for accounts, and sometimes they are extremely far removed from what is recommended by the Central Bank. It is hardly necessary to convince any specialist of the importance of introducing standardized international accounting and reporting documentation. And it is also necessary to standardize documents not only in form and content but also in size so that they will be "readable" by all machines--in Russia and abroad. I have had occasion to hear from leaders of certain commercial banks that they intend to introduce their own methodology for settling accounts. This cannot be allowed. The Central Bank must provide this methodology for the other banks. Otherwise this will be like creating some kind of separatist state with its own laws within the framework of our country. Therefore proponents of this kind of "banking separatism" are either incompetent people or people who are deliberately trying to make it easier to conduct certain illegal operations. The interests of the matter demand also the development of a system of economic indicators which would be included in the primary accounting documentation and the settlement-payment documents, including checks and credit cards. These indicators should become the basis for statistical reporting as well. Without doing this the Central Bank cannot solve a single important problem, including the problem of nonpayments. This is the basic preparation of the so-called software. Unfortunately, as it were, this matter is not even off the ground yet. The next important problem is the organization of settlements. I am convinced that there is no longer any alternative to cash settlement centers. But we must immediately start to optimize and standardize them. But sometimes things are reduced to the absurd. For example, in Leningrad Oblast, with a population of approximately 6 million, there are four to six cash settlement centers in operation that complete settlements in three days. But in Krasnodar Kray, with a comparable population, there are 38 cash settlement centers which cannot complete their work within acceptable periods of time. The picture is the same in Altay and also many other places. The quantitative distribution of cash settlement centers throughout the oblasts of the country has a striking lack of uniformity: from three to 54! And, after all, cash settlement centers, from the standpoint of common sense, should span rayons, with one center for every three to four rayons. They should have communications for delivering settlement documents taking into account the availability of storage facilities for cash reserves, transportation mainlines, and information networks. The Central Bank must not give anyone a system of settlements. In the event that alternative centers are created, copies of all postings must still be entered into the central computer of the Central Bank. What are alternative centers? I will explain with an example. Let us say that three or four banks create a clearing center on the basis of one of the commercial banks and process clearing documents for a group of commercial banks in one of them. A duplicate of all postings must then be sent to the Central Bank. Otherwise it will not be able to get an idea of the condition of monetary turnover, the situation with cash money, or how things are going with credit in the country. And as a result it would be impossible to establish an optimal discount rate or a realistic exchange rate for currencies. And a realistic exchange rate for currencies must be established with a special information system (analogous to the REUTER one) which would include all commercial banks working with currency and each day (and best of all in real time) would submit all information on currency operations to the Central Bank. The procedure followed now for establishing the exchange rate through the exchange creates preconditions for manipulating currency exchange rates in the interests of particular political and financial groups. I must not fail to touch upon several more essential aspects. Today many commercial banks (about 90 percent of them) are largely state banks. Their charter capital was formed, as a rule, from funds of state enterprises. I think it is time to solve the problem of privatization of these banks and return of state funds to the budget or to the state treasury--taking into account the inflation index during all the time of the withdrawal of state funds. We must not forget that the money lying in these banks as charter capital is our public money. Nothing terrible will happen here--after all, these banks have gotten fairly firmly on their feet. But here it is up to the Central Bank and parliament, which must adopt the corresponding legislative provisions. And the funds returned by the banks will be sources of investment in industry. In order for our Central Bank to operate normally I think it has to have in its structure a powerful analytical subdivision which would analyze the national economy and the economy of the commercial banks. Moreover, it would be expedient to create under the Central Bank a public supervisory council with the right to make recommendations--consisting of representatives of science, industry, and commercial banks. The task of the council would be to conduct expert appraisals of important decisions of the Central Bank as is done abroad. I am categorically against the idea put forth by certain commercial banks of turning the Central Bank into a joint-stock company. In the present transition stage with our unruly market environment the Central Bank must remain a state institution. The Savings Bank of Russia, with more than 50 percent of its shares belonging to the Central Bank, is another matter. It is a monopolist subject to immediate privatization with the formation of regional, municipal, or territorial banks based on it. But today it seems to be advantageous both to state bureaucrats and to the Central Bank to have this kind of pump for extracting money from all of Russia, and they certainly do not spend all of it on the regions. And in the regions, because of the shortage of monetary resources, separatist sentiments are arising. We absolutely must define and create a system of strict currency regulation. So far we have passed up important elements of this system--access of foreign banks for operation on Russian territory. And we should have done this for two reasons. First, hard currency would not then leak out of the country. What is the point in transferring it, say, to France if this money could be put in the Russian branch of the same French bank. The result would be the same, but it would be achieved at less cost. Second, foreigners would create healthy competition on our domestic market for banking services and would demonstrate the art of working, which would be to the advantage of domestic banking. But this step must be accompanied by a certain protectionism of these banks on the part of the Central Bank. Allowing foreign banks on our territory should be restricted and the privilege should be granted to only certain banks with good reputations that are significant and have a developed world infrastructure. Moreover, these banks could help their Russian colleagues to train bank specialists. We will not change much unless we adhere in practice to the well-known administrative postulate: A new business must be created by new people; reforms cannot be conducted through the hands of those who are interested in retaining old procedures. It is necessary, for example, to promptly renew the administrative apparatus of the Central Bank, bringing in young talented and highly educated specialists. Chiefs of oblast special bank branches who have been working in this system for 15-20 years, as a rule, are fairly conservative people. Their mentalities were formed at a different time and they will never become market players in the best sense of the word. The Americans say that if you are 35 years old and you do not have experience working with a computer, you will not acquire it because you are simply afraid of the computer. Thus for these people the "fear effect" will not allow them to master new banking technologies. Now about work with cash money. The Central Bank should make some changes in this area as well. In my view, the Central Bank must return to the "Russia" checks. But they should be introduced gradually, being used at first in settlements with the population for durable goods only within the autonomous formations: The city or at most the oblast, when the main administration (city or oblast) is capable of developing a mechanism for the introduction of the checks and monitoring their migration. As for credit cards, for now they are acceptable in Russia only for businessmen and people who are simply rich. These cards will not soon become widespread in Russia. In order for credit cards to be in mass use it is necessary to have many things. For example, they must be produced in large quantities; it is necessary to have fairly costly devices--automatic teller machines; in stores, kiosks, cafes, train stations, airports, etc. there must be special devices for reading the information from the credit cards. All this will take a minimum of eight to 10 years. And the Russian mentality is not ready for them. That is, there are no alternatives to checks in Russia so far. Incidentally, in the area of the introduction of an electronic payment system, like electronics in general, the Central Bank must show patriotism. It should not provide money to support foreign firms by buying their technical equipment, but this money should be used to convert domestic enterprises so that they will master the output of mass banking equipment. And not only computation equipment but also automatic teller machines, devices for reading credit cards, and the main thing--sorting machines for processing checks. We will have to switch to international standards in electronics. And if representatives of the European Community gather in Geneva to develop a technical policy and particularly to decide which banking equipment to buy, we are resolving this problem with extraordinary ease: Each bank buys whatever it sees. Whatever country its representatives have managed to get to, there they make their purchases. But this is fatal for Russia. We need standards for technical policy. Otherwise we will get ourselves tightly involved in an electronic system of settlements without really understanding it. And the last thing. Today we are discussing the problem of reducing the budget deficit by having the Ministry of Finance sell precious metals to the Central Bank. I think that in this case the Central Bank would only increase the liquidity of its capital by issuing empty money or, rather, at the expense of its long-suffering taxpayers. In my view this is a political solution that will harm the country's economy.
