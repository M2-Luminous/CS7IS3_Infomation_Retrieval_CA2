Profile of Affected Buildings Estimates of the number of buildings potentially affected by the indoor air standard were developed by OSHA based on Department of Energy's commercial building energy consumption survey (CBEC) 1989 7 [Ex. 4&hyph;303]. There is a total of 4.5 million commercial buildings in the United States. Commercial buildings are defined as all non-manufacturing/industrial and non-residential structures. Table VI&hyph;1 presents the distribution of buildings by use, occupancy and thermal conditioning. Approximately 28 percent of all buildings are for mercantile or services. Other uses include offices (15 percent), assembly and warehouses (14 percent each), food service (5 percent), lodging (3 percent) and food sales and healthcare (2 percent each). The ``other'' category (1 percent) covers buildings such as public restrooms and buildings that are 50 percent or more commercial but whose principal activity is agricultural, industrial/manufacturing or residential. 7 The commercial building and energy consumption survey is a triennial national sample survey of commercial buildings and their energy suppliers. This survey is the only source of national level-data on both commercial building characteristics and energy consumption. On average, the largest types of buildings are for education and health care. Mercantile and service buildings account for the greatest number and floorspace of any single activity category. Office buildings account for nearly as much floorspace, but far fewer buildings. Together office and mercantile buildings represent almost 40 percent of all buildings and floorspace. Warehouses and assembly buildings both are almost as numerous as office buildings, but account for less floorspace. Over 62 percent of buildings have only one floor and 13 percent have three or more floors. Most buildings (69%) house single establishments. Government occupied buildings represent 13 percent.
