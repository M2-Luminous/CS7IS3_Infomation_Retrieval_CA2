Do you agree? [Bindi] First, I refuse to consider [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi as being at the center of the system. We cannot go back to the Ptolemaic system that we overcame with the first-past-the-post electoral law. Nor can we determine what the political framework will be five years from now. In addition, our centrist position focuses not only the majority but also the left-wing opposition. Because if we were to finally have a modern Left not under the PDS' [Democratic Party of the Left] thumb, then it is likely that the right-wing grouping would change too, thus creating the conditions for the moderate electorate to return to the center. However, we cannot do this with somebody who deceived the moderates. [De Martis] Even if Berlusconi were to break with [National Alliance leader] Fini? [Bindi] The problem of this Right lies not only with National Alliance but with Berlusconi himself. [De Martis] Why? [Bindi] Because of the incompatibility of his role as head of government and his being the owner of three television channels. Because Forza Italia in itself is the opposite of politics seen as participation by the people. Because it is the expression of the entrenched financial interests. Because it legitimated two radical and populist right-wing parties. [De Martis] You are aiming at an accord with the progressives then? [Bindi] No, the difference between me and Buttiglione is that he wants to build a Center-Right group and therefore has already chosen which field to play in. I want to build a Center without allies, which, because of its specific political battles, will be able to attract people from both the current Center-Right and current Center-Left. [De Martis] But such bipolarity.... [Bindi] Once the extreme Right and Left have been put on the sideline, the alternative will be a reconstructed Center and a moderate Left. However, even the Left cannot pretend that the problem lies only with [Communist Renewal Secretary] Bertinotti. The problem is the PDS, with its governing class, structure, and desire to control. If it does not change, we cannot hope to have a modern evolution in the Italian Left. [De Martis] Where will the PPI [Italian Popular Party] fit into this picture? [Bindi] The PPI must also be an alternative to this renewed Left. However, if the Right were to continue to become radical instead of evolving, then it would be our duty to ally ourselves with this new Left. If we were in France and had to choose between the Socialist Delors and the Liberal Giscard we, as Catholics, would have to ally ourselves with the second. However, if Berlusconi, Fini, and [Northern League Secretary] Bossi were to be still there instead of Giscard, then we could do nothing else but ally ourselves with Delors. [De Martis] Why do you want Romano Prodi [chairman of the Institute for Industrial Reconstruction] as PPI secretary? [Bindi] Because he is the one who best incarnates the policy of a Center that is capable of drawing consensus from all directions. He has demonstrated that he knows what the Center means in relation to the Right and Left in connection with a specific political battle, that of privatization. [De Martis] Did the Buttiglione-De Mita meeting surprise you? [Bindi] It is part of the strategy preceding a congress. Buttiglione is looking for an ally. [De Martis] Will he find one in De Mita? [Bindi] De Mita is an intelligent person. If I understand his line of thinking, I think that he will not support Buttiglione. [De Martis] Will the congress really take place in July? [Bindi] By postponing the deadline for membership to the end of May, it has in fact become impossible to hold the congress before the summer. There are two choices therefore: either the congress is postponed until after the summer on the basis of new membership and this regency is maintained; or a "radical" congress will be organized before the summer just to elect the secretary, leaving the membership issue until another traditional congress is held.
