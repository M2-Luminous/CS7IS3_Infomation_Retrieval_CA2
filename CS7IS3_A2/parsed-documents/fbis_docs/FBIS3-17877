On 27 March the party's third congress nominated the well known dissident as candidate for president. At the initiative of Lev Grigoryevich himself, the congress demanded without too much talk that the results of the "antidemocratic and rigged" elections for the Federal Assembly be annulled and the amnestied coup plotters be put back behind bars. Most important, the "communist" Chernomyrdin government should resign and presidential elections should be called to elect a new head of state. It turned out that Boris Yeltsin is "soft as wax" and that he "has been continuing Gorbachev's line toward appeasing the reactionary forces and has struck a secret deal with the criminal Rutskoy and the fascist Zhirinovskiy." According to Ubozhko, "Messrs. Yeltsin and Zhirinovskiy go to the baths together once a month, and after taking a steam bath they would not mind playing a game of checkers." As a result, it turned out that "the king does not have anything on," and what he does is to sacrifice his allies, apparently confusing checkers with give-away. Any "infection," Lev Grigoryevich thinks, should be nipped in the bud by introducing presidential rule. He promises to mark his coming to power by the immediate firing or even exiling of all members of the old party nomenklatura who sabotage reform. As for racketeers, he promised to get rid of them within a month by arming all entrepreneurs to a man.
