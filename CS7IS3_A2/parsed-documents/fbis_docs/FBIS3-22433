At a meeting with journalists following the conference, Antii Vuorinen from Finland said that the radiation danger still plagues the Baltic Sea region. To reduce that danger, it is necessary that the newly freed Baltic states join with agreements that have previously been concluded with the Soviet Union. These would include agreements on curbing the proliferation of nuclear substances and, in case of danger, making information available promptly. Vuorinen was pleased that the problem of removing nuclear waste from Paldiski is close to being solved. Foreign ministry advisor Mark Sinisoo elaborated on his remark. Namely, the working group had received new data on several of the problems recently. To remove nuclear waste from Paldiski, Russia wants to use a brand new TK-18 type of container that has never been used for that purpose before. This is why they have to be tested, which is to be done in March. What if Russia's nuclear monitoring agency should declare them unfit? Russia, at this time, does also not have a policy for storing nuclear waste, and this needs to be coordinated with the government. Besides, this policy supposedly also depends on the availability of money and on Russia's so-called `global nuclear problems.' By way of consolation: The Paldiski issue will not be coming to a standstill because of these snags. The working group also discussed Sillam�ae and matters related to radioactive beacons. Other news pertaining to the not-so-secret Salaspilsis reactor in Latvia (a science-oriented facility) revealed that it uses 90-percent enriched uranium. The latter presents quite a hazard.
