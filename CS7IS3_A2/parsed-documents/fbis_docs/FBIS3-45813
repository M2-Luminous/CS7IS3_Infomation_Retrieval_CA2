Top priorities will be tax returns, government revenues and expenditures, and keeping track of banks and other financial organizations according to Lu Peijian, Auditor-General of the State Auditing Administration (SAA). Lu said emphasis will also be placed on auditing enterprises and investments in construction and agriculture. "Auditing must be strengthened this year, a key year for China's reform and economic development, to ensure reforms are implemented smoothly," Lu told a national auditing conference which opened yesterday in Beijing. To back up the "tax-sharing system," which refers to the division of taxes between the central and provincial governments, the audits of local governments' final fiscal accounts in 1993 will focus on whether their revenues and expenditures are accurate since the new system will use 1993 figures as their base, Lu said. Auditors will also keep a closer eye on the central bank and policy bank's management of State assets to support financial reform. Meanwhile, during the commercialization of existing specialized banks, it will be the auditors' job to ensure that no State properties are lost in the course of restructuring. In addition, Lu said about one-third of the country's key construction projects will be inspected annually for financial irregularities. Auditors will also try to examine every project which has been completed. He said project reviews are aimed at strengthening management of the country's investments, improving economic performance and keeping costs low. Lu said the inspection of State enterprises will focus on the preservation and growth of State assets. When auditing Sino-foreign joint ventures, emphasis will be placed on assessments of State assets, he said. In addition, to ensure that the country's investment in agriculture is correctly spent, State auditors will pay particular attention to the expenditure of funds this year, he said. Lu said that during 1993 auditing departments across the country placed more attention to public finance, money markets and key construction projects. He said the auditing of local governments' revenues and expenditures and reviews of illegal interbank borrowing have helped the country rectify financial order and control the size of capital investment. More than 182,000 units were audited last year and 3.392 billion yuan ($389.9 million) found to be illegally earned through violations of financial regulations has been turned over to the State, he said. Meanwhile, a total of 11.95 billion yuan ($1.374 billion) has been saved through recovering misused funds and curtailing expenditures. The figure was 5.204 billion yuan ($598 million) more than the previous year's figure.
