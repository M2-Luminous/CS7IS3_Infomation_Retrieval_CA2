An official of the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of China (PBC), the country's central bank, said that Shanghai's financial sector has been operating normally as a result of the campaign to rectify the financial order nationwide. Statistics released by the branch showed that the amount of savings deposits in the city in the first 11 months of 1993 were 33.8 billion yuan (about 3.88 billion U.S. dollars) more than that at the end of 1992. During that period, the amount of loans extended by various banks in Shanghai was 23.1 billion yuan more than in the whole of 1992. Various financial markets were bullish in 1993, the official said. For example, trading in the Shanghai foreign exchange swap center, the largest of its kind in the country, was heavy last year, with nearly 500 billion yuan changing hands. Mao Yingliang, director of the PBC Shanghai branch, said, "the stability and prosperity of the financial sector has not only helped Shanghai achieve a sustainable, fast and healthy economic growth, but also has paved the way for its own further restructuring in the new year." He described 1993 as a "year of the reform" for the city's financial sector. In the new year various state-owned specialized banks will become commercial banks by pursuing what Mao called "risk-related management." Competition will be encouraged among these banks, Mao said. Moreover, credit co-ops in both urban and rural areas will be turned into co-operative banks this year so as to better help spur the growth of the local economy, he said. He said that the Shanghai municipal authorities have decided to permit 26 foreign-funded financial institutions to handle business in Chinese currency this year, but within a government-prescribed range. The governor said that Shanghai will try even harder this year to turn itself into a national financial center. The China Foreign Exchange Trading Center is expected to open in Shanghai in early 1994 to form unified quotations nationwide. Furthermore, a gold exchange that will adapt to the global market will open later this year, Mao said, adding that both gold jewelry and gold bullion will be traded on the new exchange. He said, "we are also going to expand and improve short-term treasury bond market, inter-bank lending and borrowing market and other monetary markets in the new year."
