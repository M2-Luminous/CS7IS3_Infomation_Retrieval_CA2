After his talks with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad, Klestil indicated that he was disappointed with his position on the peace process. "While I was optimistic after my last visit to Cairo and the talks there with Mubarak, 'Arafat, and Peres, this has since changed." Al-Asad is a realist and he does not expect a breakthrough in Israel's peace negotiations with the PLO, he said. The return of the Golan Heights is indispensable for Syria; at the same time, Damascus strictly opposes secret negotiations with Israel and distrusts its desire for peace, Klestil reported. He also quoted the Syrians' wish that Austria continue the tradition of Kreisky and Waldheim and commit itself more in the Middle East. Foreign Minister Mock, who accompanied the president, stressed that Austria still plays an important role for the region: For example, Vienna was asked in connection with the secret negotiations between the PLO and Israel, but finally Oslo was chosen as the place for the talks. "Our newspapers would immediately have reported on it," Klestil said with a smile. Al-Asad paid tribute to the role of the Austrian blue helmets. Should an agreement be achieved between Israel and Syria after all, Austria could provide additional troops to monitor a demilitarized zone, Klestil suggested. The Austrians are experienced in the region, so he can also envisage that the government in Vienna would agree to it, he said. On Sunday Klestil was able to satisfy himself of the present situation on Golan. [passage omitted] About 460 Austrian blue helmets, who received the visitor enthusiastically, are currently stationed in Syria. [passage omitted] Despite all the benevolence that was shown to Austria in Damascus, economic relations are not developing as desired. There are several projects, above all in the sectors of energy and medicine, but many have not been concluded because of unclear financial questions. Experts in tourism were also part of the small economic delegation as there is increasing demand for Syria as a tourist destination, but the infrastructure is not yet developed well. Today, Monday, the president will travel to Jordan for his next state visit. Foreign Minister Mock returned to Vienna on Sunday. [passage omitted]
