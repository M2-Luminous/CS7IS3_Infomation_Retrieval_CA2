The occasion was closed to the media, but a tape of the speech reached the local Jewish community, which sent it on to Israel. 'Arafat's speech revolved primarily around the issue of Jerusalem. He said that the Cairo agreement was merely the first step and that the liberation of Jerusalem is the Muslims' main objective. He called on the Palestinian people to launch a jihad in a bid to liberate Jerusalem. 'Arafat's bombshell, with or without quotation marks, was his revelation that when the Cairo agreement was signed, he received an Israeli letter confirming that Jerusalem is one of the issues on the negotiations agenda and that the discussion on Jerusalem will begin within three years. Let us hear him: [Begin 'Arafat recording, in English] The jihad will continue. And Jerusalem is not for the Palestinian people; it is for all the Muslim ummah [nation]. You are responsible for Palestine and for Jerusalem before me. You have to understand our meaning: Battle is not to get how much we can achieve from them here or there. Our main battle is Jerusalem: Jerusalem, the first shrine of the Muslims. This has to be understood for everybody. And for this I was insisting, before signing, to have a letter from them, from the Israelis, that Jerusalem is one of the items which has to be under discussion. And not this state, the permanent state of Israel. No! It's the permanent state of Palestine! Yes, it is a permanent state of Palestine. And in this letter -- it is very important for everybody to know -- I insist to mention, and they had written it, and I have this letter. I didn't declare, I didn't publish it till now. In this letter, we are responsible for all the Christian and the Muslim and the Islamic holy sacred places. You have to come and to fight and to start the jihad to liberate Jerusalem, your first shrine. And this is very important, and for this in the agreement, I insist -- with my colleagues, with my brothers -- to mention that not exceeding the beginning of the third year and directly after the signing of the Cairo agreement, to start discussing the future of Jerusalem; the future of Jerusalem. And, you saw me in the TV while I was hesitating. You remember this thing? You remember the picture? Because I was insisting to mention Jerusalem. And I said: Okay, I don't want only from Rabin this promise. No, I want this promise from the cosponsors Christopher and Kozyrev and the witness, President Mubarak. And this had been done, which is very important for you. The Samarians in Nabulus and the Neturey Karta [ultra-Orthodox community] in Jerusalem, they are refusing to recognize the State of Israel, and they are considering themselves as Palestinians. I am saying this to give the proof that what they are saying that it is their capital -- no, it is not their capital! It is our capital; it is your capital! It is the first shrine of the Islam and of the Muslims. [end recording]
