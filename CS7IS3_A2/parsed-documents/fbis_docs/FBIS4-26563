Lu Ping struck yet another positive note on the stalled airport talks just two days before the Airport Committee starts another round of negotiation on Chek Lap Kok's financial package. Speaking in the Legislative Council, Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod said the Government hoped good progress would be made at the talks tomorrow. Mr Lu, director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said he hoped a decision on the airport would be reached by the end of next week. But that would only be possible if Britain co-operated, he said in an interview with the ASIAN WALL STREET JOURNAL published yesterday. Under the latest financial package, the Government will put $60.3 billion into the Mass Transit Railway Corporation and the Provisional Airport Authority. The amount of borrowing, however, would still be around $20 billion. . Under the 1991 deal or Memorandum of Understanding, the government can only proceed with borrowing in excess of $5 billion if China agrees. Mr Lu said China was prepared to accept a debt ceiling substantially above $5 billion but declined to give a figure. "It's still far above five... Yes, I have said we are very flexible," he said. Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten said Mr Lu's remarks were "positive and constructive." "I very much hope that we'll see an increasingly good and cooperative relationship with China and it's obviously in the interests of Hong Kong. I hope that both of us will be able to see the words we used about cooperation turned into real practical successes in the work of the Joint Liaison Group and elsewhere too. I think people in Hong Kong want to see actions as well as hear words," he said. Mr Patten said he would like to see a decisive breakthrough at the meeting of the Airport Committee tomorrow, adding that no one should "count the eggs before they are hatched". An overall financing agreement would speed up the construction of the airport, he said.
