FR940513-1-00034 FR940513-1-00009 VII. Review Under Executive Order 12778 Section 2 of Executive Order 12778 instructs each agency to adhere to certain requirements in promulgating new regulations. These requirements, set forth in section 2(a) and (b)(2), include eliminating drafting errors and needless ambiguity, drafting the regulations to minimize litigation, providing clear and certain legal standards for affected legal conduct, and promoting simplification and burden reduction. Agencies are also instructed to make every reasonable effort to ensure that the regulation describes any administrative proceeding to be available prior to judicial review and any provisions for the exhaustion of administrative remedies. DOE certifies that the proposed rule meets the requirements of section 2(a) and (b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. VIII. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act DOE has determined that promulgation of this proposed rule falls within the procedural rulemaking class, Category A6 of Appendix A to Subpart D, ``Categorical Exclusions Applicable to General Agency Actions'', of the DOE National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations. 10 CFR part 1021. It is therefore categorically excluded from preparation of either an Environmental Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement under the NEPA (42 U.S.C. 4321, et. seq). IX. Opportunities for Public Comment A. Written Comment Procedures Interested persons are invited to participate in this rulemaking by submitting data, views, or comments with respect to the proposed rulemaking. Twelve copies of written comments should be submitted to the address indicated in the ADDRESSES section of this notice and must be received by the date indicated in the DATES section of this notice. Comments should be identified on the outside of the envelope and on the documents themselves with the designation ``REPI NOPR, Docket No. EE&hyph;RM&hyph;94&hyph;301''. In the event any person wishing to provide written comments cannot provide twelve copies, alternative arrangements can be made in advance with DOE. All written comments received will be available for public inspection as part of the administrative record on file for this rulemaking in the Department of Energy Freedom of Information Office Reading Room at the address provided at the beginning of this notice. If informal meetings or other contacts occur during this rulemaking, DOE may add a memorandum to the record on file summarizing what transpired. Pursuant to the provisions of 10 CFR 1004.11, any person submitting information which that person believes to be confidential and which may be exempt by law from public disclosure, should submit one complete copy of the document, as well as two copies from which the information claimed to be confidential has been deleted. DOE reserves the right to determine the confidential status of the information and to treat it according to its determination. B. Public Hearing 1. Request to Speak Procedures A public hearing on the proposed rule will be held at the time and place indicated in the DATES and ADDRESSES Sections of this notice. Any person who has an interest in the proposed rule or who is a representative of a group or class of persons that has an interest in the proposed rule may request an opportunity to make an oral presentation. A request to speak at the public hearing should be addressed to the address or phone number indicated at the beginning of this notice. The person making the request should briefly describe his or her interest in the proceedings and, if appropriate, state why the person is a proper representative of the group. The person should also provide a phone number where he or she may be reached during the day. Each person selected to be heard will be notified by DOE as to the approximate time they will be speaking.
