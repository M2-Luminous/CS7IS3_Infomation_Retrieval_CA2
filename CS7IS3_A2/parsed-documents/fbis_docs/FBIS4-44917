Public-Private Sector Joint Research Programs The technical development of private companies in Japan is shifting from the traditional means in which companies import technologies from abroad to a more modern approach whereby companies base their growth on applied research and practical research oriented toward commercialization and industrialization. However, when we consider the current technological level and development potential of Japan, it is obvious that a stronger emphasis must be placed on more fundamental research and development. Research and development in basic and foundational areas carries with it major technical and economic risks, so it is hard to say whether such R&D will be fully implemented by private companies in Japan. On the other hand, since the AIST laboratories were established we have seen a steady growth of practical results in the area of foundational research, so the research potential is extremely high when observed from that perspective. In order to more effectively promote foundational research in Japan, AIST initiated the Private-Public Sector Joint Research Program in 1985 with the specific aim of implementing joint research that would take maximum advantage of the foundational research potential in AIST laboratories and be organically linked with the human and financial potential of private industry. In the conventional joint research system, government research laboratories would promote research and development through the private sector, but that system was equivalent to allocating research as there was no exchange of research or shared use of equipment. It would be an overstatement to say that this system was successful, particularly since there were no budgetary actions taken by the government. The new joint research program, however, enables centralized joint research by establishing organic links between the public and private sector. This research program includes the joint use of equipment owned by AIST laboratories as well as equipment owned by private industry. 1. Priority Research Projects These are research projects in which public interest is thought to be particularly high. These topics are concerned with foundational research essential to building an industrial base and with joint research between private companies and AIST laboratories in high priority areas. 2. Research Implementation The research will be carried out at AIST laboratories or at private corporations depending on the needs at the time. (2) Use of research equipment In order to produce effective joint research based on organic links between the public and private sector, AIST laboratories will accept private researchers (civilians), allow private research equipment to be used, and allow private researchers to use research equipment owned by the AIST research laboratories free of charge. In addition, the government will send researchers to private companies as the need arises (official business visits). (3) Research and development funding Personnel costs will be handled separately. In terms of the equipment needed for research, there will be no charge to either party for the use of each other's equipment. Payment for new equipment, supplies, and utilities will be determined according to the respective share of research being implemented by each party. (4) Contributing equipment It will also be possible for privately owned companies which are supplying their own equipment to the AIST laboratory for the purpose of joint research to donate that equipment to the AIST research laboratory if it is thought to be too expensive to remove the equipment once the joint research has been completed, or if the equipment was designed exclusively for a particular joint research project, or if it was built so that it could continue to be used in the future by the AIST laboratory. The research findings made during joint research will become joint public-private property. FY93 Budget - Â¥250 million Joint Public-Private Research Projects (July 1, 1993) Research AIST Term Partner Description Lab Develop highly GIRI, 1991 - Mitsubishi Chemical In advanced selective Toh, 1994 Industries, Ltd., industries where isolating agent GIRI, Hitachi Chemical development of new for metallic Hok Co., Ltd., Rasa materials plays a elements based on Industries, Ltd., central role, it is advanced molecule Nippon Rensui Co., essential that recognition Ltd., Asaka Riken there be a stable function Co., Ltd. supply of highly pure rare metals for use as raw materials, and likewise essential, there should be a more sophisticated method for separating metals based on composition analysis in order to conduct process and quality management of new materials.
