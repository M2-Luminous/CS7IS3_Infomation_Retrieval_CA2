The acute critical charge of the speeches on the previous two days was not reflected in the results of the voting at all. The bill on the budget system for 1994 was taken as read just as calmly. The Planning and Budget Commission embarked on its modification, and everyone else embarked on the "resort" act submitted by the trade unions. The essence of the problem here is as follows. The passes that are sold by the unions at preferential prices or provided altogether without charge and paid for from the social insurance fund are regarded by the tax inspectorate, apparently, as citizens' supplementary income. Accordingly, income tax, according to currency legislation, has to be collected from this income. An example: The full cost of a pass is R700,000; the preferential 10 percent cost, R70,000; the income of the vacationer (or patient), R630,000; income tax, R75,600. And even if the pass is free, the tax forces a person to pay the treasury R84,000. Yet the social insurance fund is formed from enterprise deductions, that is, from wages, essentially. At first sight the matter is clear: People need to be exempted from this tax. But an attendant question arose at the session also: Should this privilege be accorded to all in succession or should its use be confined merely to needy citizens? The latter proposal of Deputy M. Khafizov was supported by President M. Shaymiyev also. As a result, the Legislation Commission received the assignment of urgent modification of the bill. Then Deputy K. Iskhakov presented a draft decree on the procedure of implementation of the Public Service Act. The act itself was adopted at the previous session, and VEDOMOSTI has already written about its content. It remains to add that the law will be introduced gradually and that government officials will start their free leave travel in 1995. Serious problems arose over the law on off-budget funds. Things had gone well at the morning sitting, seemingly, and the first two articles were, albeit not without difficulty, adopted. In the break something [line missing] began to kill article after article. One clearly had the feeling that some people had done some active work with them. Who might this have been? If it is considered that from the very start of business of the present Supreme Soviet the government has carefully been withdrawing the off-budget funds from the deputies' control, the first suspicion is clear. It is, in fact, the last one also inasmuch as no one other than the government has such a level of influence on the corps of deputies. Ultimately the bill was sent for modification. After an early lunch, which came about on account of problems over modification of the budget act, the session adopted quite rapidly the "resort" act, after which came one further unscheduled break, and for the same reason. The intensive bargaining in the Planning and Budget Commission with the participation of the government produced no result. Ultimately the deputies were offered a draft budget with expenditure approximately one-fourth in excess of revenue. How, we would like to know, is this difference to be covered? In the February budget this question was solved simply--by money issue. But Tatarstan does not have its own printing press, and it will be necessary, consequently, to look for some other ways. The budget was not adopted, and the deputies will, therefore, work tomorrow also.
