In an interview with Asket [name as received] cable television on Thursday, Lebed brushed off accusations that his "troops are worsening the economic crisis in the Dniester Republic" as groundless. Many blame the soldiers who are paid in new Russian roubles for the low buying power of the local population. The soldiers exchange their money for old Soviet banknotes which are the only legal tender in the republic on the black market at a very high exchange rate. Lebed also accused the authorities of the Dniester Republic of misappropriations. He stressed that over 11 billion roubles are used annually to keep the bureaucratic apparatuses and servicing personnel of Dniester leaders, as well as finance the studying of their children and relatives abroad. He blasted Dniester officials for abusing their powers and offices and neglecting the needs of the people.
