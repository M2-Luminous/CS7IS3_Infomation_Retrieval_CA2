According to local officials, 13,000 urban households have so far moved into new homes through joining housing cooperatives. The funds to build housing cooperative homes come mainly from future dwellers themselves, coupled with a small subsidy from their employer and certain preferential treatment from the city government. Wuhan is believed to be one of the first cities to pilot the housing cooperative system in China. Over the past several years, more and more factories and institutions got together and set up housing cooperatives, to help solve the housing problem for their own workers. Some 61 housing cooperatives have now been established in the city, constructing flats with floor space totalling 945,000 sq m.
