ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Executive Vice President, Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) and the Administrator, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, is announcing that the reservation and grazing land of the Fort Totten Indian Reservation of North Dakota is an acute distress area and that CCC-owned feed grain will be donated to needy livestock owners on the reservation. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Newcomer, Livestock Programs Branch, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, P.O. Box 2415, Washington, DC 20013&hyph;2415, 202&hyph;720&hyph;6157. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to the authority set forth in section 407 of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1427), and Executive Order 11336, notice is being given that I have determined that: 1. The chronic economic distress of the needy members of the Devils Lake Sioux Tribe (the Tribe) of the Fort Totten Indian Reservation of North Dakota has been materially increased and become acute because of excessive rains in the summer of 1993, thereby creating a serious shortage of feed and causing increased economic distress. This reservation is designated for Indian use and is utilized by members of the Tribe for grazing purposes. 2. The use of feed grain or products thereof made available by CCC for livestock feed for such needy members of the Tribe will not displace or interfere with normal marketing of agricultural commodities. 3. Based on the above determinations, I hereby declare the reservation and grazing land of the Tribe to be an acute distress area and authorize the donation of feed grain owned by the CCC to livestock owners who are determined by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, United States Department of the Interior, to be needy members of the Tribe utilizing such lands. These donations by the CCC may commence upon May 1, 1994, and shall be made available through May 31, 1994, or such other date as may be stated in a notice issued by the Administrator, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service. Signed at Washington, DC, on May 2, 1994. Grant Buntrock, Administrator, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, and Executive Vice President, Commodity Credit Corporation.
