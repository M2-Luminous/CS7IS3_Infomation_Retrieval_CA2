Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura yesterday delivered a message from President Jose Eduardo dos Santos to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali. The message deals with issues linked to Angola's current political situation. Minister Venancio de Moura, who has been visiting New York for three days, took the opportunity to hold talks with high officials from the U.S. State Department and White House to discuss the country's political crisis. Afonso van Dunem, Angola's ambassador to United Nations, had this to say on the issue: [Begin Van Dunem recording] In brief, I can say that the foreign minister has been in New York for two days and his visit is aimed at delivering a message from the president of the republic to the UN secretary general. It was a very timely, useful, and busy visit. [end recording] We asked Afonso van Dunem to comment about the meeting between the Angolan foreign minister and the UN secretary general on the establishment of the new UNAVEM [UN Angola Verification Mission]-3 contingent, and he said: [Begin Van Dunem Recording] This issue was touched on because a number of steps must be taken before the UNAVEM-2 is transformed to UNAVEM-3. First, the Security Council has to meet and approve a resolution sanctioning the UN secretary general undertaking a process of political and logistical transformation, and this has a number of implications. However, the time has not yet come for the Security Council to discuss the issue of UNAVEM-2's transformation to UNAVEM-3. Obviously, all this will depend on the whole process, since this does not depend only on our government. It depends on concrete conditions on the ground, on the talks which are under way, and as I have said, on the whole peace process in Angola. [end recording] In his diplomatic mission, as well as dealing with political issues, the Angolan foreign minister took the opportunity to appeal to the international community to assist the victims of war in the country. [Begin Van Dunem] Our government's priority is not only political issues regarding the peace process, but also issues linked to humanitarian aid by the international community, namely the United Nations.
