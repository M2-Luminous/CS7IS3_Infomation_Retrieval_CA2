This program, PERS, has the goal of producing a follow-up model for the French-British Concorde in the next century, the companies announced on Thursday [7 April]. The work, which extends over several years, would be financed by the three companies in equal shares. According to the plans, the new plane is to have a range of 10,000 km and be able to carry 250 passengers. It is to fly with a speed of 2,000 km per hour (Mach 2). The companies pointed out that long-distance flying is increasing constantly. It is estimated that, in the year 2005, 50 million people per year will fly either across the Atlantic, from Europe to Asia, or from Asia to North America. Given the fact that 500 to 1,000 planes will then probably be wanted on the market, only some kind of supersonic plane can be profitable. The three companies pointed our that, within a greater framework, in which U.S., Italian, Japanese, and Russian companies are included, they also participate in research for a second-generation supersonic passenger plane. The development costs for such a plane are estimated by experts at $12 to $15 billion.
