Director General of Foreign Trade Joko Muljono yesterday said that since as early as March 1991, EEC officials have indicated that car radio imports from Indonesia had less than 60 percent local content and were therefore ineligible to receive the GSP facility. However, since Indonesian exporters did not take heed of the warning, the EEC sent a fact-finding commission to Indonesia in March 1993, which discovered concrete evidence showing that several companies had violated the GSP terms," Joko said. "The EEC asked the Indonesian Government to deal firmly with the violators and threatened that if the violations were not stopped, it would disqualify, not only car radios, but all Indonesian products from the GSP facility," he said. Joko said the Indonesian Government is presently handling the case and the director of foreign trade relations has been negotiating with the EEC in Brussels since February 21. "As of March 1993, we found eight companies proven to have violated GSP regulations," he said. "We appeal to Indonesian companies to have a higher sense of integrity by obeying the agreed regulations because the violation of several companies will damage the integrity of all other exporters to Europe," he said. Joko said the components used for the car radios exported to the EEC were imported from various countries, including Korea and Malaysia.
