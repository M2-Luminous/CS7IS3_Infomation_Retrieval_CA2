In the north, the powerful Islamic movement al-Islah, which backs President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, sees the conflict as a "jihad" or holy war against the "atheists" of the Yemen Socialist Party (YSP) in the south. Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, al-Islah leader, told journalists recently that the war between north and south was "a holy war that must not be stopped, even if it costs a million lives." Al-Ahmar, also speaker in the northern-dominated parliament, repeated in his name a fatwa issued previously by 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Daylami, another al-Islah leader. Sanaa radio broadcast the fatwa, which declared that "a ceasefire in the war against the atheists is against the Islamic Shariah (law)." Al-Daylami, a professor at Sanaa university, advocated "the continuation of the jihad against the secessionists, including women and children." His appeal was repeated by imams, or prayer leaders, in Sanaa mosques during Friday prayers. But southern mullahs -- Muslim scholars -- close to the YSP immediately condemned the northern fatwa as "heresy." Southern mullah Sa'id 'Ali Nur responded with another televised fatwa, calling on Yemenis to "put an end to this fratricidal war" and reminding them that the Koran forbids "brother Muslims" to kill each other. However, other mullahs in the southern Hadhramaut province issued a statement calling on southerners to "use their legitimate right of self-defence" to "push back the (northern) invaders." The statement, broadcast on Radio Aden, added: "Our religious and national duty tells us to carry out a just fight against the forces of evil, who plunder our wealth and attack our honour." 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri, appointed vice president of the breakaway southern state, used Friday prayers in Aden's principal mosque to condemn "the call to murder innocent women and children." But al-Jifri, head of the moderate Islamic party League of the Sons of Yemen, called for calm from the faithful who demanded revenge attacks on northern residential areas. He said al-Islah was "regressive." YSP leaders have accused the movement of protecting members of the shadowy fundamentalist group Jihad, which has carried out attacks on southern targets. Al-Jifri also challenged northerner Shaykh 'Abd-al Majid Zindani to a televised debate on the war of the fatwas. Al-Zindani is a member of the presidential council at Sanaa, as well as being the leading theorist of al-Islah and a declared enemy of southern "atheists." Al-Jifri said the TV debate would be refereed by the principal theological authority for Sunni Muslims -- Shaykh Jad al-Haqq 'Ali Jad al-Haqq, vice chancellor of Al-Azhar university in Cairo. Al-Zindani has not yet risen to the challenge. In the meantime Shaykh 'Abd-al-Aziz Bin-'Abdallah Bin-Baz, head of the highest religious authority in neighbouring Saudi Arabia, sent an "urgent appeal" to Yemeni leaders for an "immediate halt to this fratricidal war." War broke out between Salih's forces and those of his southern rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid on May 5. The south declared the breakaway Yemen Democratic Republic on May 21, ending four years of uneasy unity since former conservative North Yemen merged with the Marxist South.
