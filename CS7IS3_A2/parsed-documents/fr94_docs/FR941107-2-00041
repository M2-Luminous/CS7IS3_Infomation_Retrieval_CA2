FR941107-2-00041 FR941107-2-00010 Hevensa argues that the fee it had agreed to with the provider of the technical services and which it had been accruing during the POI was not approved by the Venezuelan Superintendent of Foreign Investments (SIGHTS) and that the accrued rate had been adjusted subsequently because the original amount had not been authorized by SIGHTS. Hevensa asserts that the adjustment must be based on the amount that SIGHTS approved. DOC Position: We agree with Hevensa. We have adjusted the royalty expense to reflect the amount that the Venezuelan government permitted Hevensa to pay for the POI. Comment 9: Petitioners assert that the silicomanganese slag further processed into Grade C silicomanganese by Hevensa is a co-product of Grade B silicomanganese. The petitioners also state that because the silicomanganese slag should be considered a co-product to the Grade B silicomanganese, the Department should allocate Hevensa's production costs equally between Grade B silicomanganese and silicomanganese slag. The petitioners support the argument that the slag should be classified as a co-product by noting that both the Grade B silicomanganese and the slag share a single common production process. The petitioners also argue that inasmuch as only minor processing is necessary to process the slag into Grade C silicomanganese, the value of the Grade C silicomanganese is representative of the value of the slag, and that this value is significant because of the percentage of total sales that Grade C silicomanganese accounted for during the POI. Hevensa argues that the silicomanganese slag generated in the production of its Grade B silicomanganese is a waste product and, therefore, should not be treated as a co-product. Hevensa cites to the petition in this investigation in which silicomanganese slag was classified as a waste product that received no assignment of costs as support for its treatment of the silicomanganese slag. Hevensa also argues that the silicomanganese slag is not a finished product and cannot be sold without substantial further processing. DOC Position: We disagree with the petitioners. In determining how to allocate costs among various products manufactured during the course of producing the merchandise subject to the investigation, the Department, pursuant to Section 773(e) of the Act, looks to the value of the other products relative to the value of all products produced during, or as a result of, the process of manufacturing the product under investigation. See, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value (SLTFV): Sebacic Acid From the People's Republic of China, 59 FR 28053, 28056 (May 31, 1994). See also IPSCO, Inc. v. U-Stat, 965 F.2d 1056 (Fed Cir. 1992). If the value of the joint product is significant, the Department will treat such product as a co-product, with the result that all costs incurred in the production process are allocated based on the relative quantity of output of the joint products. Id., 965 F.2d at 1060. In this case, the silicomanganese slag further processed into Grade C silicomanganese is not a co-product of the Grade B silicomanganese, because its value is not significant in relation to the Grade B product. The petitioners' conclusion that the total value of Grade C silicomanganese sales revenue during the POI was significant compared to the total value of Grade B silicomanganese sales revenue during the POI is not accurate. The petitioners fail to take into account that the sales revenue data used in their analysis reflects the disproportionate production and sales quantities of Grade B silicomanganese and silicomanganese slag during the POI. That is, a significant amount of silicomanganese slag which was used to produce the Grade C product sold during the POI was generated from slag produced in prior years. Petitioners' analysis also fails to take into account the additional costs incurred to recover the Grade C material from the slag. These additional costs should be deducted from the gross revenues received for the sales of Grade C silicomanganese to perform a net realizable value comparison. After these adjustments, the net realizable value of silicomanganese slag produced during the POI is insignificant when compared to the net realizable value of all products produced during the POI. See, e.g., Final Determination of SLTFV Polythylene Terephthalate Film, Sheet and Strip From the Republic of Korea, 56 FR 16305, 16316 (April 22, 1991), concerning the accounting of recycled scrap film. Accordingly, no allocation of costs is appropriate. Comment 10: The petitioners assert that the Department should calculate depreciation expense on the restated value of Hevensa's fixed assets. The petitioners state that although Hevensa's use of historical cost based depreciation in its submissions to the Department is consistent with Venezuelan Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the resulting depreciation expense is distorted by the high level of inflation in Venezuela during the POI. Although Hevensa revalued its assets in its financial statements for the fiscal year ending October 31, 1993, Hevensa argues that Venezuelan GAAP did not permit this revaluation of assets. Hevensa further states that because its calculation of depreciation expense on the basis of the historical value of its fixed assets for its submissions to the Department is in accordance with the home-market country's GAAP, it should be accepted by the Department. DOC Position: We agree with the petitioners that the depreciation expense should be based on the restated value of Hevensa's fixed assets. Normally, the Department does calculate costs in accordance with the GAAP of the home market country ( see NTN Bearing Corp. of America v. V-State, 826 F. Supp. 1435, 144&hyph;42 (CIT 1993). However, the Department will not use a country's GAAP if it does not accurately recognize a company's actual costs or distorts those costs ( see Id. ). This case is unusual because the accounting authorities in the home market country itself changed their position on the restatement of fixed assets, allowing it for fiscal years beginning after October 31, 1993, after having not approved it in prior years. This decision to revise Venezuelan GAAP was made on the basis of an on-going analysis of the impact of economic conditions on the reporting of financial data.
