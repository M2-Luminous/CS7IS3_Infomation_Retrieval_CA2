Fishman said the report admits that "there is virtually no corruption" in Costa Rica's police force, which is prevented from taking more effective action against drug trafficking because of a lack of financial resources. "I am proud because they say there is no corruption," the minister told ACAN-EFE, saying that contrary to what Washington says, Costa Rica has dealt "harsh blows" to drug traffickers in recent years despite the limited resources. Fishman said he "disagrees" with the assertion that Costa Rican policemen are unprofessional. He said that Puerto Limon on the Atlantic coast is a problem area and added that many resources have been allocated to fight drug trafficking and consumption. The State Department's annual report, released today, highlighted the progress made by Central American governments, with the exception of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, in the fight against drug trafficking and money laundering. The report says the "laundering of drug money" is particularly serious in Costa Rica, Honduras, and Nicaragua, but virtually nonexistent in El Salvador. The State Department praised Guatemala the most for its cooperation with Washington in several campaigns to eradicate cocaine and opium and to arrest drug traffickers. According to the State Department, meager resources and a lack of professionalism among security services preclude significant progress in the counternarcotics struggle in Costa Rica. The report says Puerto Limon has become the main point of contact between the Colombian island of San Andres, the Nicaraguan coast on the Caribbean, and the United States. At the same time, however, the report said there is virtually no corruption.
