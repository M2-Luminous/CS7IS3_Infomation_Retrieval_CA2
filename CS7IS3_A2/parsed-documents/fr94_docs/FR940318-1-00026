FR940318-1-00026 FR940318-1-00009 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Customs Service 19 CFR Part 4 RIN 1515&hyph;AB37 Preliminary Vessel Entry and Permits to Lade and Unlade AGENCY: Customs Service, Department of the Treasury. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This document proposes to amend the Customs Regulations regarding the preliminary entry of vessels arriving in ports of the United States and the granting of permits for the lading and unlading of merchandise from those vessels. It is intended that the Customs Regulations regarding this subject accurately reflect recent amendments to the underlying statutory authority, enacted as part of the Customs Modernization Act. DATES: Comments must be received on or before April 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments (preferably in triplicate) may be addressed to the Regulations Branch, Franklin Court, U.S. Customs Service, 1301 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20229, and may be inspected at Franklin Court, 1099 14th Street, NW., Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James Finnegan, Office of Inspection and Control, 202&hyph;927&hyph;0510 (operational matters), or Larry L. Burton, 202&hyph;482&hyph;6940 (legal matters). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On December 8, 1993, amendments to certain Customs and navigation laws became effective as the result of the President signing Public Law 103&hyph;182, Title VI of which is popularly known as the Customs Modernization Act (the Act). Sections 653 and 656 of the Act significantly amend the statutes governing the entry and the lading and unlading of vessels in the United States. These operations are governed, respectively, by sections 434 and 448 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1434 and 1448). Prior to the subject amendments, the entry of vessels of the United States and vessels of foreign countries had been governed by separate statutes (19 U.S.C. 1434 and 1435), neither of which included elements concerning preliminary vessel entry or the boarding of vessels. The Act repealed section 1435 and amended section 1434 to provide for the entry of American and foreign-documented vessels under the same statute. Additionally, the amended section 1434 now provides authority for the promulgation of regulations regarding preliminary vessel entry, and while neither mandating boarding for all vessels nor specifying that optional boarding must be accomplished at any particular stage of the vessel entry process, the amended law does require that a sufficient number of vessels be boarded to ensure compliance with the laws enforced by the Customs Service. Section 1448 had previously linked the granting of preliminary vessel entry to a mandatory boarding requirement and the physical presentation of manifest documents to the Customs boarding officer. The amended section 1448 no longer contains provisions regarding preliminary vessel entry, vessel boarding, or manifest presentation, matters which are now provided for in other statutes. Section 1448 now states that Customs may electronically issue permits to lade or unlade merchandise, pursuant to an authorized data interchange system. The regulations which implement the statutory authority for the granting of preliminary vessel entry and the issuance of permits to lade and unlade merchandise are contained in §§4.8 and 4.30 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 4.8 and 4.30). These provisions still contain mandatory boarding and physical document presentation requirements, and of course do not include any reference to the new electronic permit issuance option. This document proposes to amend §§4.8 and 4.30 in order to properly implement the amended statutory authority. Comments Before adopting this proposal, consideration will be given to any written comments [preferably in triplicate] that are timely submitted to Customs. Comments submitted will be available for public inspection in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), §1.4, Treasury Department Regulations (31 CFR 1.4), and §103.11(b), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 103.11(b)), on regular business days between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. at the Regulations Branch, U.S. Customs, Franklin Court, suite 4000, 1099 14th Street, NW., Washington, DC. Regulatory Flexibility Act 1. For the reasons stated in the preamble, pursuant to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), it is certified that, if adopted, the proposed amendments will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, they are not subject to the regulatory analysis or other requirements of 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Executive Order 12866 This document does not meet the criteria for a ``significant regulatory action'' as specified in Executive Order 12866. Drafting Information The principal author of this document was Larry L. Burton, Carrier Rulings Branch, U.S. Customs Service. However, personnel from other Customs offices participated in its development. List of Subjects in 19 CFR Part 4 Customs duties and inspection, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Vessels.
