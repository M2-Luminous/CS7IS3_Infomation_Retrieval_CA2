This will allow the appointment of a replacement, with the agreement of the other provincial parties. According to remarks made tonight by Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf, the new provincial governor will emerge from an agreement among the ruling Justicialist Party, the Jujuy Popular Movement, which won the 10 April elections, and the Radical Civic Union. At the government house Ruckauf announced that the legislature will meet tomorrow to appoint Ficoseco's replacement and begin the province's political recovery. Ficoseco made his decision to ask for a leave of absence after meeting at the government house with Ruckauf and presidential Secretary General Eduardo Bauza. [passage omitted] Nevertheless, the possibility of tipping the balance in favor of an intervention, following an escalation of the conflict in the province after unending protests by the state workers labor union and other labor unions, has not been ruled out. The government source placed the possibility of an intervention on a "stand-by" status. Ficoseco's "elegant" departure cools down Jujuy's overheated situation, even though the social situation experienced by this province remains very critical, and might have serious consequences.
