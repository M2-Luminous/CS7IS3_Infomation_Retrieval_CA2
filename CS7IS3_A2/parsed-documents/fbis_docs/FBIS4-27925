This was announced today by Jericho Kagawan, Philippine National Police [PNP] director for operations. He explained that the operation was a result of the group's continued refusal to stop their illegal activities. The group is behind the series of kidnap-for-ransom cases in different parts of Mindanao. Negotiations were conducted with the group on stopping these activities, but they fell on deaf ears. According to Kagawan, three Marine battalions supported by the PNP are currently sweeping down on the areas where the bandits are hiding.
