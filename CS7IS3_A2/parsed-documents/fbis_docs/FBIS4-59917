The first batch of the advanced aircraft will de delivered to Israel in 1997. The newspaper notes that these fighter planes will enable Israel to reach distant targets, including Iraq and Iran. In its comment today, AL-AHRAM says this deal has added another dimension to the arms race in the region. It has also provided further proof that Israel and the United States want to maintain their military superiority over the Arabs. In addition, Israel will use this superiority as a bargaining chip in any settlement with the Arab countries. AL-AHRAM warns that Israel's desire to strengthen its military arsenal might harm the peace process because the other states might find themselves compelled to increase their armament capabilities to achieve a military balance with Israel. All this will lead to an arms race in the region.
