FBIS4-53369 "dreas095_d_94014" FBIS-EAS-94-095 Daily Report 18 May 1994 South Korea * DPRK Investment in Leisure Facilities * DPRK Investment in Leisure Facilities 11111111 11111111 CSO [Editorial Report] The Seoul daily HANGUK ILBO on 4 April publishes on page 23 a report on North Korean investment in recreational facilities. The report claimed that in order to ease the rising social tension, the Pyongyang government has invested in leisure facilities such as karaoke music rooms and sports centers including a huge bowling center in Pyongyang. On 25 February, Kim Il-song personally visited the newly opened Pyongyang Bowling Center and expressed his pleasure with the facilities. The bowling center, 40 lanes in a 14,300 square meter space, was built with the help of the Chochongyon [Association of pro-North Korean residents in Japan] Chamber of Commerce. It is a complete recreation center with a large restaurant, saunas and various activity rooms. Since opening its first karaoke music room in Pyongyang in 1992, a large number of music rooms have been opened and are being opened throughout North Korea. Recreation and sports complexes are under going major renovations. A sports, culture and rest center in Nungnado in Pyongyang will have eight tennis courts, a roller rink, an archery center, a golf practice area and badminton courts, and so on when renovation is completed. A sports center in Panwoldo, also in Pyongyang, is adding water sports facilities; a water play area for kindergarden children, a swimming pool for children and a swimming pool for students. A new facility called "The All-Around Leisure Center," located in the Munsu area of eastern Pyongyang, is nearly ready. This center has been heavily advertised in the North Korean media as a new type of recreation center with all kinds of recreation facilities. It is expected to have sky rides, high-tech swings and other advanced amusement rides, and a summer land with various water recreation facilities. Additionally, 26 huge theaters were built since early 1993, adding to the already existing 1,000 or so theaters. According to the North Korean media, most of these were built in the North Hwanghae Province and North Pyongan Province. These theaters can be used for movies, plays, operas, musicals and circuses. North Korea has only one golf course and it is located in Nampo city. The greens fee is very high; 3,000 Japanese yen for members and 10,000 yen for non-members. It appears that North Korea has no plan to build new golf courses. It is the Seoul government's view that North Korea is sensing social tension which could lead to major unrest. Thus, Pyongyang has to do something for the people and it is spending money, of which it has very little to spare, to build leisure facilities for them.
