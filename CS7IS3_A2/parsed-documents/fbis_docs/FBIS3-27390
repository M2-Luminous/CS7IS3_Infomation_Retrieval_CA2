Among the 21 major kinds of export commodities that earned at least 10 million U.S. dollars each in 1993, 14 were farm and sideline products. And, over 90 percent of the soybean exports of the whole country came from Heilongjiang. Experts here attributed the fast growth in farm exports of the province to growing border trade with Russia in recent years. Along the 3,000-km borderline, 70 percent of the townships and 30 percent of the villages have built their processing industries, while inland cities have set up many export farm bases in the province. To boost the development of an export-oriented economy, the province has invested about 120 million yuan to build more than 170 farm production bases itself over the past few years. It has also set up economic ties with over 30 countries and regions throughout the world, using foreign funds to build modern farms and processing industries.
