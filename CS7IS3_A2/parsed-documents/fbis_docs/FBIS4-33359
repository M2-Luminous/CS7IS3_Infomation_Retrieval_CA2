Lien is visiting Mexico at the invitation of his friend, Mario Vazquez, who owns a number of news organizations and businesses in the Central American country, the ministry said. Vazquez, who visited Taiwan last year, is very friendly to Taiwan and has contributed a lot to promoting substantive relations between the Republic of China [ROC] and Mexico, the ministry noted. Lien is the highest-ranking ROC official to visit Mexico since the two countries severed diplomatic ties in 1971. While there, the ministry said, Lien will meet with Mexican business leaders on Mexico's economic situation since it joined the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Lien may also exchange views with Mexican officials on possible investment and economic cooperation projects between the two countries and seek Mexico's support for Taiwan's bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, government sources said. Taiwan-Mexican trade has increased steadily since 1989 when the semi-official China External Trade Development Council opened a representative office in Mexico. Two-way trade totaled about US $700 million in 1993, with Taiwan enjoying a surplus of US $300 million. As a NAFTA member, Mexico provides easy access for foreign investors to the vast North American market. Many Taiwan companies have set up production facilities in Mexican cities bordering the United States in recent years. The ROC opened a representative office in Mexico City on May 1 to further promote bilateral exchanges. In Taipei, Mexico has issued multiple entry visas for Taiwan visitors since June 1991. Lien is being accompanied by his wife and several Foreign Ministry officials, including Vice Foreign Minister Fang Chin-yen, on his Mexican tour. Lien will leave Mexico Tuesday (Taipei time) for New York for a family reunion with his two children who are studying there. The premier is scheduled to return to Taipei Saturday. Lien, heading a 21-member entourage, flew to El Salvador in late May to attend the inauguration of new Salvadoran president, Armando Calderon Sol. He then made a four-day official visit to Guatemala. Most members of Lien's entourage will not accompany Lien to Mexico and the United States. This is Lien's second overseas trip this year, following a visit to Honduras and Belize in January.
