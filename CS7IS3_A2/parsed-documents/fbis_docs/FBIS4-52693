Bills related to tax reform are originally planned to be approved at an extraordinary Diet session in fall. However, prospects of approval remain uncertain due to the secession of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] from the administration. Moreover, there is a possibility of Diet dissolution to be followed by a general election. Under such a political situation, there is increasing concern over the possibility that "the official pledge given to Japanese citizens and foreign countries may not be fulfilled." On the other hand, some members of the ruling coalition parties hold the view that the situation might develop into a realignment involving part of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the right wing of the SDPJ, saying: "Depending on how tax system reform is handled, this may trigger the realignment of political parties." The Hata administration gives top priority to raising the consumption tax rate in tax reform. Taking possible opposition by the SDPJ and the public into consideration, the expression "rise in indirect tax" was used in the policy agreement reached before the inauguration of the coalition administration. However, most ruling party members now say that "The agreement should have clearly stated 'consumption tax hike.' There is no possibility of and time for working out a completely new tax. There is no other choice but to correct the defects of the present tax system and raise the consumption tax," (according to a participant of the ruling parties' representatives' meeting). The ruling parties' tax system reform council has to urgently reorganize its affairs because members from the SDPJ, such as Council Chairman Koken Nosaka, have left the ruling coalition. However, it is also true that some ruling party members express the optimistic view that "it becomes easier to reach a consensus because there is no factor of uncertainty" after the secession of the SDPJ opposed to the consumption tax hike, (as stated by a senior Shinseito official). However, even if the reform bills are worked out, the following possibilities still exist: 1) The Hata cabinet will be forced to resign en masse or dissolve the House of Representatives to hold a general election if a motion of no confidence against the cabinet is submitted after passing the 1994 budget bill; and 2) tax reform bills may not be approved by the Diet because of the opposition of the LDP and the SDPJ, even if Hata cabinet remains in the office. Some SDPJ members, who won public support in the last election by advocating "opposition to consumption tax," will run in the election for the House of Councilors next summer. While SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama says that "there is no other choice but to share the tax burden through indirect tax," the party urges a radical revision of the consumption tax that will result in its virtual abolition. Most LDP members also adopt a cautious stance that "a tax hike should not be implemented thoughtlessly."
