"I expect the government delegation will adopt some position, which I believe it will relay to the insurgents in Mexico; however, I expect it will not contribute to curtailing the possibility of an agreement," the defense minister added in referring to the issue. He was very careful when he referred to the peace talks, indicating that in a 10 January agreement, both sides agreed that any statements referring to the talks would be made by UN Moderator Jean Arnault. "In any case, it should be up to the president or [Presidential Adviser] Hector Rosada, but I would be making a mistake in commenting on the issue. Even if I were aware of what's going on, I would still be missing sufficient details to explain the thing clearly and sincerely. Also, we would not like to create confusion and distrust with respect to the talks," he added. Nevertheless, Enriquez did refer to statements by Commander Pablo Monsanto of the Rebel Armed Forces [FAR], who remarked on the possibility of an agreement during the talks. Enriquez also alluded to the OAS Human Rights Commission resolution on Guatemala and stated that not appointing a rapporteur is "a real acknowledgement by the international community of the efforts the government is making to ensure respect of fundamental rights." The defense minister acknowledged that in this respect there are still problems, but that efforts have been made and now it is impossible to say that there is a policy or systematic intent to violate fundamental human rights, and that is why the Geneva resolution was something to be happy about. He also commented on recent statements by adviser Monica Pinto and stated that "the Army influences political stability because that has always been our intention, and there is evidence of that." No Conditions for State of Exception In referring to a possible state of exception in Guatemala, the general indicated that so far conditions are not suitable for such a measure although if it is ordered, the Armed Forces will obey what corresponds, in accordance with the determined degree. He indicated that "it is a decision that corresponds to the president and the Legislative Branch, we can only receive orders according to the degree that is decided. If the decision is made, well, there are degrees of prevention, calamity, war, and siege." On the other hand, he explained that the boats seen from the Presidential Palace are some of the four boats assigned to the Pacific and Atlantic naval bases. He, however, denied the boats were armed. He did not explain the cost of the boats, but did say that they were 27-foot, "Vigilant"-type speed boats to be used in counternarcotics, rescue, and other Navy operations. The defense minister concluded by stating that the "Navy is poorly equipped because it has not received support for the past 20 years. Some equipment was purchased during the [Jorge] Serrano administration, but Ramiro de Leon Carpio has so far not even purchased a canoe." [Guatemala City PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish on 8 March carries on page 3 a 240-word report in which Defense Minister Mario Rene Enriquez "did not rule out the possibility that the urban rebel commando groups may be the authors of the attack that completely destroyed the foundations of the [San Juan River] bridge, located 20 km from Guatemala City. He added this is a worrisome situation."]
