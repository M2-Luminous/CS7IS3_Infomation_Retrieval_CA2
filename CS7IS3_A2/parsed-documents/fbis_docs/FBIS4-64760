"For the moment, French nuclear weapons are not at everyone's disposal, they are under sole French control," the socialist president said in an address at the presidential palace to French military and civilian officials. Mitterrand said control of the nuclear weapons could not be handed over to an international authority, adding that he stood by the late president Charles de Gaulle's 1966 decision to pull out of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's integrated command. "I firmly maintain this decision. Nohing will make me change it," Mitterrand said. Referring to the "tragic solitude of those who have the power to decide," the president said that the decision to use nuclear weapons must rest with the head of state because of the short time available to "respond to a threat of aggression." Mitterrand spoke after he and his conservative government adopted a bill setting out French defence options for the next six years. His audience Thursday included Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and Defence Minister Francois Leotard. The head of state and the government disagreed on two issues -- whether or not to resume nuclear testing at Mururoa in the Pacific and the fate of nuclear weapons buried in silos on the Albion plateau in southeastern France. Mitterrand opposes resumption of nuclear testing, favoured by the right, and wants to keep the Albion site operational. Much of the governing right-wing coalition wants to abandon strategic missiles in favour of airborne nuclear weapons. France also has nuclear missile-armed submarines.
