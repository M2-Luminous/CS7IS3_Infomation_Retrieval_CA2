FR940617-0-00004 FR940617-0-00003 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Soil Conservation Service 7 CFR Part 658 Farmland Protection Policy AGENCY: Soil Conservation Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule amends part 658 of title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulations which implements the Farmland Protection Policy Act (FPPA). The amendments contained in this rule are necessary to enable the Department of Agriculture to effectively implement the FPPA, as amended. They request reports by federal agencies, recognize the statutory authority of a governor of a state to bring legal actions to enforce the FPPA, provide policy direction regarding federal assistance and federal programs, and they restore a subsection of the existing rule that was omitted from publication by clerical error. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule becomes effective June 17, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lloyd E. Wright, Director, Basin and Area Planning, Soil Conservation Service, PO Box 2890, Washington, DC 20013, telephone 202&hyph;720&hyph;2847. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The regulations of the United States Department of Agriculture (the Department) implementing the Farmland Protection Policy Act (FPPA) are contained in 7 CFR part 658. A proposed rule, setting forth several amendments to these regulations, was published for public comment on January 14, 1987, at 52 FR 1465. The comment period closed February 27, 1987, during which time nineteen sets of comments were received from five federal agencies; four state agencies; seven national organizations in the agricultural, resource conservation, and planning fields; one county board of supervisors; and two individuals. The proposed rule, as discussed below, contained six amendments to the Department's existing regulations. Of these six amendments, three were being proposed as a result of the specific changes in the FPPA that Congress had enacted in section 1255 of the Food Security Act of 1985, Public Law 99&hyph;198, 99 Stat. 1518. Another amendment to the existing rule was to correct a clerical mistake. These four amendments, with minor changes, are made final by this rule. The two remaining amendments, of the six included in the proposed rule, were not responses to any new direction enacted by Congress, but were the Department's proposals to change its policy in the interpretation of FPPA provisions. These two amendments were a departure from the policy that the Department had announced when the existing regulations were promulgated on July 5, 1984, 49 FR 27716. The existing sections of part 658 that would be changed by these two amendments are §§658.2(a) and 658.3(c). The rationale underlying the provisions of the existing regulations is set forth in the preamble of the final rule publication, which is found at 49 FR 27716&hyph;27724. The rationale for the proposed changes is set forth in the preamble of the proposed rule at 52 FR 1465&hyph;1468. After reviewing the policy considerations that led to the adoption of the existing regulations in 1984, as well as considering the proposed changes and the public comments to the proposed rule, the Department has concluded that the proposed amendments to §658.2(a) should be adopted with some additional interpretive clarification, as discussed below. In addition, the Department has concluded that §658.3(c) should be amended as proposed to comport with the authority of a governor of a state to take action to enforce the provisions of the FPPA with regard to a policy or program of the affected state for the protection of farmland. I. Background The FPPA was enacted as Subtitle I, sections 1539&hyph;1549, of Title XV of the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981, Public Law 98&hyph;98, 7 U.S.C. 4201&hyph;4209. In enacting the FPPA, Congress found that the Nation's farmland was ``a unique natural resource'' and that each year, ``a large among of the Nation's farmland'' was being ``irrevocably converted from actual or potential agricultural use to nonagricultural use,'' in many cases as a result of action taken or assisted by the federal government. The FPPA directs federal agencies to identify and take into account the adverse effects of federal programs on the preservation of farmland; consider alternative actions, as appropriate, that could lessen such adverse effects; and assure that such federal programs, to the extent practicable, are compatible with state government, local government, and private programs and policies to protect farmland.
