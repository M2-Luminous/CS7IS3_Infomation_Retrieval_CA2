FR940318-0-00144 FR940318-0-00023 h. Alternative technologies. Several technologies already exist as alternatives to equipment using class I substances. As a result of the CFC phaseout, they are gaining prominence in the transition away from CFCs. Examples of these technologies include evaporative cooling, desiccant cooling, and absorption refrigeration and air conditioning. In addition, several technologies are currently under development. Significant progress has expanded the applicability of these alternatives, and their environmental benefits generally include zero ODP and low direct GWP. In addition, evaporative cooling offers significant energy savings, which results in reduced indirect GWP. 3. Comment Response a. Comments on acceptable substitutes. A commenter opposed listing the use of HCFC&hyph;123 as acceptable because of toxicity concerns. EPA has conducted worker exposure studies which indicate that exposure can be limited to 1 ppm, substantially below the industry-established acceptable exposure limit (AEL) of 30 ppm. Based on these studies, EPA remains confident that HCFC&hyph;123 can be used safely when standard industrial hygiene practices are followed. It is important to note, too, that the AEL is a long-term exposure limit. Safety measures to limit short-term exposures are important for all refrigerants. Another commenter informed EPA that chlorine-based refrigeration systems are generally physically separated from chlorine-containing process streams. This separation invalidates the analogy to hydrocarbon-based systems for industrial process refrigeration. Hence, EPA's final determination that chlorine is acceptable for this end-use includes the acknowledgement of OSHA standards dictating safety considerations in the design and operation of such systems. b. Other comments. Several commenters requested additional end-use categories, while others requested greater aggregation. Some aggregation is necessary to minimize confusion and the analysis of small differences among similar applications. Yet EPA also recognizes that certain end-uses are fundamentally different from others. In the NPRM, EPA identified major end-uses within the refrigeration and air conditioning sector. For purposes of the final rule, EPA is reluctant to change the end-use categories from those listed in the proposed rule. Retaining the original end-uses serves the goal of creating the certainty needed to encourage transition away from ozone-depleting substances. However, this final rule does combine substitute listings for various refrigerants within each end-use. For example, industrial process refrigeration now includes substitutes for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502. The risk screens conducted by EPA analyzed the use of substitutes within an end-use; the chemical being replaced was usually not relevant to the analysis. Because it may be important to distinguish among substitutes for certain substances if they exhibit significantly different operational characteristics, such as condensing pressure or typical ambient conditions, the listings do not combine centrifugal chillers into one end-use. Rather, retrofitted CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, and CFC&hyph;114 chillers remain separate. A commenter proposed that all blends consisting of individually acceptable components be deemed acceptable. EPA believes that blends pose analytical difficulties not encountered with single refrigerants. Blends, unlike single compounds, have the potential to separate into components during normal use and during leaks. This process is called fractionation, and it is caused by differences in vapor pressure among the constituents. For example, as a zeotropic blend enters the evaporator, it is a liquid until it absorbs enough heat to reach the boiling point of the component with the highest vapor pressure. As this portion boils away, the remaining components will have a higher overall boiling point, and the temperature will rise until the second component begins to vaporize. This process may continue until all the refrigerant is in vapor phase, or some may remain a liquid even at the exit from the evaporator. Azeotropes and near-azeotropes, however, exhibit small changes in temperature in these two-phase parts of the system, and do not undergo significant composition changes during normal use. During normal operation, pressure across the condenser and evaporator remains relatively constant. During a leak, however, system pressure decreases. In addition, the refrigerant is exposed to ambient temperatures. As a result, fractionation is possible during a leak when both vapor and liquid are present, even for azeotropes. As with all substitutes, flammability and materials compatibility testing are necessary for blends. For azeotropes, these data are necessary for the single composition during normal operation. For zeotropes, such testing is necessary at all compositions occurring during normal operation. In addition, such tests should be conducted during multi-phase leaks for all blends to determine the extent and effects of fractionation. Even if the blend is nonflammable as formulated, enrichment of a flammable component through fractionation could result in a flammable mixture. In addition, materials compatible with the blend as formulated may not retain that compatibility if fractionation results in a substantially different composition. Therefore, EPA believes it is not appropriate to automatically find all blends of acceptable components also acceptable. Only specific compositions will be designated acceptable, as described earlier.
