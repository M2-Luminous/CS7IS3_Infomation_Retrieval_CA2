FR941021-0-00034 FR941021-0-00002 Civil Justice Reform This document has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order (E.O.) 12778. It is the determination of FmHA that this action does not unduly burden the Federal Court System in that it meets all applicable standards provided in section 2 of the E.O. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements contained in these regulations have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB control number [0575&hyph;0163] in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). The interim final rule does not revise or impose any new information collection or recordkeeping requirements from those approved by OMB. Discussion of Interim Final Rule FmHA has chosen to publish this regulation as an interim final rule without first publishing a proposed rule due to the nature of the program and the eligibility requirements involved. Eighty percent of the 3,151 counties serviced by FmHA were declared disaster areas in 1993. Due to heavy flooding in the midwest and extreme droughts in the South, considerably more borrowers were affected by disasters in 1993 than in any of the previous five years. This program will also help those borrowers who are affected by the 1994 flood disaster in the South if they were also affected by the previous disasters in 1993. FmHA is considering extending this program in the future to assist borrowers affected only by the 1994 disaster. In order to prevent massive delinquencies and farm failures, borrowers in a crisis situation must receive immediate financial assistance. It is for this purpose and by the authority granted the Secretary under the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (CONACT), section 331A (7 U.S.C. 1981a), FmHA has made available the Disaster Set-Aside Program. As provided in section 331A, the Secretary has the authority to defer principal and interest at the request of the borrower on any outstanding loan made, insured, or held by the Secretary under the CONACT, subject to the borrower showing that due to circumstances beyond his/her control, he/she is temporarily unable to continue making payments when due without unduly impairing his/her standard of living. The set-aside program is designed to assist borrowers in financial distress who operated a farm or ranch in a county where a disaster occurred in 1993 and was declared/designated a disaster area as set forth in subpart A of part 1945 of this chapter. Under this program, farmer programs borrowers can receive immediate financial relief from their FmHA payment obligations in a more expedient manner than under subpart S of part 1951. For example, the application process is simple and easy, unlike the primary loan servicing application under subpart S of part 1951 which requires extensive documentation by both the borrower and the servicing official. There are no additional security requirements to deter the borrower from requesting debt set-aside. On the average, the borrower's installments can be set-aside the same day he/she makes the request, whereas under subpart S of part 1951, it takes an average of 90 days to process an application and restructure a loan. To comply with the statute, the borrower must be temporarily unable to make the payment being set-aside because of circumstances beyond his/her control. This is demonstrated by requiring that the borrower must have operated a farm or ranch during 1993 in which a disaster occurred and the county was declared/designated a disaster area, or a contiguous county, as set forth in subpart A of part 1945 of this chapter; that the borrower be current or not more than 1 installment behind on any and all farmer program loans, which would assure that all payments prior to the disaster were paid or the loan restructured; that if no other payments have been due on the loan, the projected farm plan for the disaster year shows that the payment could have been paid under normal conditions; and that the borrower's actual records for the disaster year must show that, because of the disaster, the borrower's projected income was reduced to an amount that would prevent payment of all family living and operating expenses and paying amounts due FmHA and/or other creditors. FmHA projects that approximately 60,000 borrowers affected by 1993 disasters will request assistance under the set-aside program. Of these borrowers, the majority have installments that came due January 1, 1994. If these installments are not paid by January 1, 1995, or otherwise set-aside, the borrower will be two installments behind and will no longer be eligible to receive disaster set-aside assistance. Borrowers more than one payment behind will be able to receive more assistance through FmHA's loan servicing program under subpart S of part 1951 of this chapter than through the debt set-aside program. However, borrowers who cannot obtain servicing through subpart S of part 1951 of this chapter may be able to cure their delinquency with set-aside assistance alone. The set-aside program will be better for some borrowers than servicing through subpart S of part 1951 of this chapter since the set-aside will be a faster process, eligibility requirements are easier to meet, paperwork is less, and some borrowers' financial distress can be resolved with only one payment deferred. The program will allow some borrowers to use sources other than FmHA to maintain their farm operation and allow them to work out their financial difficulty over the next year or so. Other borrowers may prefer to use the year to voluntarily liquidate. This regulation will, therefore, provide options to prevent the foreclosure of borrowers in both of these instances. However, borrowers who are not eligible for the DSA program, or who need more extensive servicing, will still have the opportunity to be considered for FmHA's primary loan servicing program as set forth in subpart S of part 1951 of this chapter.
