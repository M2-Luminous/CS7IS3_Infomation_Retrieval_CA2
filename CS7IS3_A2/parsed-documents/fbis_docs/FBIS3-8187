However, an impromptu oral survey conducted in the delegation evinced, among extremely stimulating ideas, the following observation from one of our foreign colleagues: The Partnership for Peace [PFP] is the only feasible chance for you Czechs, Slovaks, Hungarians, and Poles. You surely understand that we must not provoke the Russians. I explained to him and to other people who showed an interest that we accept the PFP and that we understand it: States that are politically, economically, and militarily undeveloped cannot be immediately incorporated into NATO. We did not expect immediate admission, just a guarantee of the prospect that the doors have not been closed to us, that they will not be closed, and that admission depends, first and foremost, on us, on our readiness, maturity, and resolve. Provocation is a feeble policy, and, in politics, it is rightly regarded as desperate. I am opposed to anyone being provoked, and I understand that the Russians would not like it if security structures were to evolve in Europe without them as if they were oriented against them. The PFP leaves the development of these structures wide open because the situation is still evolving in all of the postcommunist countries, and, therefore, it would not be prudent to anticipate the outcome of development and make premature and definitive decisions. However, it would be equally ineffectual not to do anything that could provoke the Russians. This means something that would only seem like a provocation. I remember the touching tragicomic attempt in 1968 by the reform communists not to provoke Moscow. Reproaches for the so-called ill-considered anti-Soviet excesses in the democratized mass media dragged on into the private discussions of the 1968-ers long after the occupying tanks had been on our territory. A renowned professor was still saying 10 years later that the caricatures in LITERARNI NOVINY were partly to blame. Masaryk [Tomas Garrigue Masaryk] dealt with a similar rebuke in his monograph on Havlicek [Karel Havlicek Borovsky]. Palacky [Frantisek Palacky] and Havlicek were certainly closer to him than Sabina [Karel Sabina 1813-77, radical writer] and Fric [Josef Vaclav Fric 1829-90, radical politician], yet he rejected Palacky's explanation that the military intervention against Prague in 1848 was provoked by the irresponsible radicalism of the people on the barricades. If Palacky has based his political concept on foundations that could have been torn up by the provocations of foolhardy people, they are such weak foundations that it is impossible to take them seriously, commented the future Czechoslovak president. If a politician or group of politicians in Europe relies on the supposition that, if there is no provocation, everything will turn out all right, he is terribly mistaken. Every devotee of the Yalta ideal of an eternally valid division into spheres of influence and of the philosophy that whoever has influence ascribed to him has the right to regard everything that repudiates it as a provocation will interpret every departure from authentic political conduct of a free state as a weakness. We know well this way of thinking; the Czechs and other nations have experienced it firsthand. It is time to emphasize again what has obviously not been stated clearly enough until now: Every state in Europe will have as much influence as it can achieve by its internal democratic arrangement, its application of the principles of a law-governed state, and its observance of human rights; to sum up, by showing respect for the freedom guaranteed by a market economy, freedom crowned by spiritual and cultural symbolization. Influence based on anything else--for instance, on the threat of countermeasures if the small postcommunist states acknowledge the European values that NATO was set up to defend--is like beating a tattoo on old drums. I hope that Czech policy will always put up stiff resistance to this. I am absolutely convinced that it will not be alone.
