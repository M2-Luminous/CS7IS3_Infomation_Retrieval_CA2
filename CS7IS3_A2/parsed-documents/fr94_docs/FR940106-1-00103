FR940106-1-00103 FR940106-1-00012 The delta smelt is adapted to living in the highly productive Sacramento-San Joaquin River Estuary (Estuary) where salinity varies spatially and temporally according to tidal cycles and the amount of freshwater inflow. (The term estuary refers to a partially enclosed water body of variable salinity with freshwater and seawater inflow.) Despite this tremendously variable environment, the historical Estuary probably offered relatively constant suitable habitat conditions to delta smelt, which could move upstream or downstream with the entrapment zone (Peter Moyle, University of California, pers. comm., 1993). Since the 1850s, however, the amount and extent of suitable habitat for the delta smelt has declined dramatically. The advent in 1853 of hydraulic mining in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers led to increased siltation and alteration of the circulation patterns of the Estuary (Nichols et al. 1986, Monroe and Kelly 1992). The reclamation of Merritt Island for agricultural purposes in the same year marked the beginning of the present-day cumulative loss of 94 percent of the Estuary's tidal marshes (Nichols et al. 1986, Monroe and Kelly 1992). In addition to this degradation and loss of estuarine habitat, the delta smelt has been increasingly subject to entrainment, upstream or reverse flows of waters in the Delta and San Joaquin River, and constriction of habitat in the less productive, deep-water river channels of the Delta (Moyle et al. 1992). These adverse conditions are primarily a result of the steadily increasing proportion of water diverted from the Delta by the Federal and State water projects (Monroe and Kelly 1992). Water delivery through the Federal Central Valley Project began in water year 1940. The State Water Project began delivering water in 1968. However, the proportion of fresh water being diverted has increased since 1983 and has remained at high levels (Moyle et al. 1992). The high proportion of fresh water exported has exacerbated the already harsh environmental conditions experienced by the delta smelt during the recent 6-year drought. The March 5, 1993 (58 FR 12854), final rule listing the delta smelt as a threatened species describes in detail the factors that have led to this species' decline. This revised proposed rule to designate critical habitat for the delta smelt focuses on habitat conditions required during specific life stages (spawning, larval and juvenile transport, rearing, and adult migration) of this annual species to ensure its eventual recovery. Shortly before spawning, adult delta smelt migrate upstream from the highly productive brackish-water habitat associated with the entrapment zone to disperse widely into river channels and tidally-influenced backwater sloughs (Radtke 1966, Moyle 1976, Wang 1991). Migrating adults with nearly mature eggs have been taken at the Central Valley Project's Tracy Pumping Plant from late December 1990 to April 1991 (Wang 1991). Delta smelt spawn in shallow, fresh or slightly brackish water upstream of the entrapment zone (Wang 1991). Most spawning occurs in tidally-influenced backwater sloughs and channel edgewaters (Moyle 1976; Wang 1986, 1991; Moyle et al. 1992). Although delta smelt spawning behavior has not been observed (Moyle et al. 1992), the adhesive, demersal eggs are thought to attach to substrates such as cattails and tules, tree roots, and submerged branches (Moyle 1976, Wang 1991). In the Delta, spawning is known to occur in the Sacramento River and in Barker, Lindsey, Cache, Georgiana, Prospect, Beaver, Hog, and Sycamore Sloughs (Wang 1991; Dale Sweetnam, pers. comm., 1993). Delta smelt also spawn north of Suisun Bay in Montezuma and Suisun Sloughs and their tributaries (Dale Sweetnam, pers. comm., 1993; Lesa Meng, pers. comm., 1993). The spawning season varies from year to year and may occur from late winter (December) to early summer (July). Moyle (1976) collected gravid adults from December to April, although ripe delta smelt were most common in February and March. In 1989 and 1990, Wang (1991) estimated that spawning had taken place from mid-February to late June or early July, with the peak spawning period occurring in late April and early May. Based on data for a closely related species, delta smelt eggs probably hatch in 12 to 14 days (Moyle et al. 1992). After hatching, larvae are transported downstream toward the entrapment zone where they are retained by the vertical circulation of fresh and salt waters (Stevens et al. 1990). The pelagic larvae and juveniles feed on zooplankton. When the entrapment zone is located in a broad geographic area with extensive shallow-water habitat within the euphotic zone (depths less than 4 meters), high densities of phytoplankton and zooplankton are produced (Arthur and Ball 1978, 1979, 1980), and larval and juvenile fish, including delta smelt, grow rapidly (Moyle et al. 1992, Sweetnam and Stevens 1993). In general, estuaries are among the most productive ecosystems in the world (Goldman and Horne 1983). Estuarine environments produce an abundance of fish as a result of plentiful food and shallow, protective habitat for young.
