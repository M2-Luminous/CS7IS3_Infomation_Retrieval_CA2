Speaking at a World Economic Forum's special session on China, Qi Huaiyuan, director of Foreign Affairs Office of China's State Council, said the areas include power plants, railways, airports and expressways. The dynamic Chinese economy was a hot topic at the forum, which opened on January 27 and attracted about 1,200 officials, entrepreneurs, bankers and economists from all over the world. Qi briefed the participants on the achievements of China's reform and opening as well as some of the new steps to be taken by the Chinese Government. Qi told them that China's gross national product (GNP) grew 12.8 percent in 1992 and about 13 percent last year. He said, however, that China is not deliberately striving for a two-digital growth rate for its own sake. The rate for this year is preferably at 9 percent, he added. On China's foreign trade, Qi said that the import and export volume rose from 20.64 billion U.S. dollars in 1978 to 195.72 billion in 1993. Qi said that China's import in 1993 alone was more than 100 billion U.S. dollars, and a total of more than 700 billion dollars of goods will be imported for the rest of this decade. He expressed the hope that as a major trading power in the world, China's status as a contracting party to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) "will be restored as soon as possible." "China's re-entry will further stimulate the expansion of its trade and economic cooperation with other countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefits and will also strengthen the world's multilateral trading regime," Qi said.
