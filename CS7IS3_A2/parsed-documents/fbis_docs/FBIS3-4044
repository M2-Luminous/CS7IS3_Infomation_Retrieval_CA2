He said: Jiangxi has been developing fairly rapidly in recent years. In particular, it has attached importance to educational work. The key to economic development and invigoration lies in training qualified personnel. The Jiangxi Provincial CPC Committee and government have firmly grasped education. This will definitely play a very positive role in Jiangxi's future development. The full meeting of the Jiangxi delegation, held this morning, was presided over by provincial CPC Secretary Mao Zhiyong. Huang Zhiquan, Huang Maoheng, Hua Tong, Lu Derong, (Liu Yizhong), (Li Lide), Huang Dingyuan, and others spoke. In light of Jiangxi's practical reality, they aired their views freely on issues such as educational reform, financial and tax system reform, foreign trade structural reform, the purchase and marketing of grain, special funds for grain storage, the development of light vehicles, and strengthening infrastructure projects. Vice Premier Li Lanqing fully affirmed those good opinions and suggestions made by the people's deputies. He said: It is necessary to take effective measures to solve the problem of pay and conditions, and housing for teachers. Input for education must be increased, and the teachers' law must be enforced well. He pointed out: The fundamental solution for education lies in reform. It is necessary to adjust well the macrostructure of education. First of all, major efforts must be concentrated on basic education. This is a matter of vital importance which concerns the quality of our nationals as a whole. Furthermore, it is necessary to develop vocational education. The majority of Chinese youths rely on vocational education to train themselves into useful persons. Reform in higher education must place its emphasis on improving quality. Financial Minister Liu Zhongli and Minister of Forestry Xu Youfang were also present at today's discussion of the Jiangxi delegation.
