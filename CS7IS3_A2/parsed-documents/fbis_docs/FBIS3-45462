Among those present at the meeting were all the members of the provincial government, officials from all the prefectural governments, mayors of cities directly under provincial government jurisdiction, people in charge of relevant government departments, some people in charge of universities and colleges, as well as people in charge of the provincial armed police corps, the provincial frontier guard corps, and the provincial fire brigade. The main topics of this meeting were to sum up government work in 1993, to arrange government work in 1994, and to propose measures to ensure the fulfillment of the reform and development objectives and tasks. Provincial CPC secretary and Governor Jia Qinglin made a speech entitled: "Working in Full Cooperation, Carrying Out Hard Struggle, and Ensuring the Smooth Fulfillment of Reform and Development." He said: Last year, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress, people throughout the province made great achievements in seizing the opportunity to deepen reform and expedite development. The province achieved 82.5 billion yuan in GNP, an increase of 25.4 percent over the previous year, quadrupling the target seven years ahead of schedule. Gross agricultural output value amounted to 32 billion yuan, an increase of 8.9 percent. Gross output value of townships and towns amounted to 101.3 billion yuan. Gross industrial output value amounted to 135 billion yuan. Marked achievements were made in the construction of basic facilities, with 13 key projects put into operation or basically completed. The people's standard of living improved. The per capita income of the people in cities and towns amounted to 2,600 yuan and peasants' per capita net income amounted to 1,150 yuan. Fifteen practical programs the provincial party committee and government carried out for the people's benefit were basically completed. Jia Qinglin pointed out that in last year's government work, there were still some aspects which were not up to our expectations. Agriculture was still weak as the foundation, farmland was reduced by 100,000 mu, there was a serious lack of funds for key construction projects, state-owned enterprises were seriously short of circulating funds, transportation and communications were overloaded, energy was in short supply, market prices increased by a wide margin and topped the 10 percent rate originally set, and there were still many problems in maintaining safety in production and social order. Further efforts are still necessary for a clean and diligent administration. All levels of government should pay full attention to these and overcome and resolve them. On government work in 1994, Jia Qinglin said that this year was an important year for speeding up reform and development. The objective of the province's economic work is to enable GNP to reach 91 billion yuan or to bring about a GNP increase of more than 1 billion yuan over 1993; to invest 22.5 billion yuan in state-owned fixed assets, an increase 21 percent; investment in basic facilities construction will amount to 12.8 billion yuan; foreign capital and total exports will amount to $7 billion; and foreign capital actually used will amount to $3.5 billion, an increase of 16.7 percent; revenue will amount to 10.8 billion yuan, an increase of 11 percent; commodity price rises will be controlled to below 10 percent; the per capita income of the people in cities and towns will amount to 2,712 yuan; peasants' per capita net income will amount to 1,300 yuan; and the natural population growth rate will be kept under 12.59 percent [figure as heard]. To fulfill these targets, Jia Qinglin requested governments at all levels pay close attention to six aspects which have an important bearing on the overall situation. The first is to maintain the sustained, speedy, and healthy development of the national economy; the second is to properly organize the implementation all reforms; the third is to give prominence to structural optimization, strengthen management, and improve efficiency; the fourth is to develop all social undertakings; the fifth is to maintain social stability; and the sixth is to strengthen the self-improvement of governments at all levels. Jia Qinglin added: An important feature of this year's reform is that, in aiming to establish a new structure, reform will be introduced to state-owned enterprises, the financial and monetary system, the planning system, the investment system, the foreign trade system, the state-owned asset management system, and the social insurance system. The industrial structural adjustment should be focused on strengthening agriculture as the foundation, the construction of basic facilities and basic industries; transforming processing industries; and developing tertiary industries. The agricultural structural adjustment should be carried out under market guidance, based on stable grain production, aimed at reaping a good harvest, and focused on cultivating high- quality and high-yield agriculture as well as secondary and tertiary industries. Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries should be developed comprehensively. [passage omitted] Enterprises and departments should boldly accept the challenges of reform and the market economy, constantly improve their management, and strengthen their competitiveness. Jia Qinglin pointed out: At present leading cadres at all levels should pay attention to major issues affecting reform and overall development, go to the grass-roots level, build ties with the masses, carry out investigations, and help resolve problems. Leading cadres and institutions should take the lead in observing discipline and practicing a clean administration and self-control. Leaders at all levels should concentrate their efforts on doing something practical for the masses to win their trust and support.
