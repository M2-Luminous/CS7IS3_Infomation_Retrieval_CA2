This was what Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk told a conference of electric power engineering enterprises' managers. Conditions are rife for this. The situation that has come about in this basic industry of exceptional significance to the national economy, is extremely complex and serious. There are, in particular, quite a lot of problems in nuclear power engineering that, to a considerable extent, ensured the work of the national economic complex last winter. Even now we are fulfilling our commitments to the state and increasing the output of the cheapest kind of electric power, said Mykhaylo Umanets, Ukraine's DerzhKomAtom [State Committee for the Use of Nuclear Power] chairman. All our reserves have unfortunately been extended. Some of the generating sets have not been provided with fuel and will stop in the very near future. [passage omitted]
