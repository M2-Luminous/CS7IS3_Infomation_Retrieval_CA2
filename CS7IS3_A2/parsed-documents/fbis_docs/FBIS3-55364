During Birkavs' term of office, Baltic cooperation at the highest level has quickly developed, but also strong competition has sprung up. There are disagreements on building an oil terminal and on cooperation between aviation companies. The Latvian premier regarded the oil terminal construction as the main problem at present. He added that Latvia and Lithuania have considered the option of building the terminal in the Latvian port of Liepaja instead of Butinge in Lithuania, and that Lithuania has already taken steps to implement the plan. Birkavs recalled that, during the recent discussion in the United Nations of a resolution on human rights violations in the Baltic states, Latvia threw its backing behind Estonia. "We decided that we'd rather risk a common defeat than proceed from different positions," he said. Commenting on the border question, Birkavs underlined that "Latvia doesn't intend to dig any ditches on its boundaries with Estonia and Lithuania." He said the three countries have reached agreement that only people entering any one of the states are checked on the border. Plans for a common Baltic economic space and for consolidating the border with Russia are under work, the premier added. With regard to the Petseri and the Abrene regions, Birkavs said the issue has to be solved at interstate negotiations. Latvia and Russia disagree about the jurisdiction over the Abrene region similarly to the Estonian-Russian disagreement over the Petseri region. Asked about the weapons of the Latvian armed forces, the premier said approaching NATO doesn't necessarily mean that arms used by NATO have to be taken into use. He attached top priority however to abandoning the former Soviet standards and guaranteeing the security of the state. Birkavs said Latvia, too, is negotiating an arms deal with Israel, and that the country hopes for credit from Israel on favorable terms. Birkavs claimed the question will be solved this year.
