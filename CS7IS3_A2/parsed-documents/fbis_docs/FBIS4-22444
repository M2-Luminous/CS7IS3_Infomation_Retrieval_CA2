I am unhappy about it myself but, try as I may, there was just no getting around the numbers. Take this one, for example: did you know that there has been a 95-percent turnover in the Criminal Investigation Department of the Moscow Oblast Internal Affairs Administration in the past year? That figure was cited by Mr. V. A. Sidorov, an administration employee, at a meeting of the oblast League of Retail and Wholesale Entrepreneurs. Mr. Sidorov attempted to blame this wholesale departure of professionals on the low pay scale. I must object. Firstly, insofar as I am aware, even the lowest pay grade for a militia employee is higher than average pay in Russia. Things are hard for everybody, except for a few. Secondly, financial difficulties are not enough to make a true professional consider changing jobs. In my conversations with former MVD employees they have cited reasons relating to morale, not financial reasons (see: "Honest People on the Night Train" in RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA, 20 November 1993). A militia major of my acquaintance left criminal investigation out of fear for his own life when he learned that an information about an operational plan he discussed behind closed doors with his bosses reached criminals the very same day. Even someone who is not a professional can understand that a 95-percent turnover in the criminal investigation staff hampers active and effective crimefighting efforts. A poll taken by the Moscow Oblast League of Retail and Wholesale Entrepreneurs among its members before this information was made public indicated that only 13 percent of them expect help from the authorities when they encounter criminal structures. The most risky type of business activity was trade (indicated by 82 percent of those surveyed), with banking in second place (77 percent), followed by services (16 percent). Only 5 percent of manufacturers are subjected to criminal pressure. That fact is easy to explain: no one is making big money in manufacturing nowadays -- people who are involved in it are barely making ends meet. Virtually all power structures are now affected by corruption. According to figures from the same poll, 60 percent of entrepreneurs had encountered bribery among public officials, and 71 percent said the same of the militia. For the procuracy, tax inspectorate and state trade inspectorate the figure was 51 percent, and for banks -- 47 percent. Once again, these figures come as no surprise -- legitimation of graft began with Gavriil Popov back at the height of "perestroyka," when he stated that a bribe is merely an "expression of gratitude to an official for a job well done." On the contrary: reported cases of bribery, now a rarity, are used by the authorities solely for the purpose of getting rid of undesirable political opponents. When they have to protect their interests, more than half of the entrepreneurs prefer not to go to the agencies that are supposed to protect those interests (76 percent do not believe the militia, 79 percent mistrust the former KGB, and 92 percent, the office of the public prosecutor); instead they enter into illegal contracts with criminal structures. Modern racketeers never impose impossible terms, as they are well aware of their own interest in keeping a businessman's business profitable. Instead one finds the excesses among bureaucrats in the "law enforcement" structures, whose appetite becomes more insatiable with each passing day. Meanwhile the taxes that should supposedly ensure your safety and mine continue to rise. Recently the minister of internal affairs publicly announced an anti-crime program that he had drawn up and submitted to the President. A secret program, I should note. That means that if it is adopted there will be no accountability requirement in connection with its implementation, since you and I do not have a "need to know" what it contains. I would like to direct particular attention to the fact that the minister has requested R2 billion [rubles] to carry out the program, and that the government has already included this funding in the budget. According to estimates by independent experts, the actual amount, not counting inflation, would already exceed that amount by a factor of nine. Considering the program's goals and the amount of taxes collected, even R18 billion is not a lot. That is to say, once again what we have is an empty declaration that does not pursue the objective of achieving real results in the fight against crime. The conclusion drawn from the figures that our editorial staff has available is depressingly simple: your safety and mine is in our own hands. Should we band together to protect ourselves? Should we move about the streets in groups? Or should we think about getting a new government? The choice is ours...
