FBIS4-47881 "drafr087_c_94034" FBIS-AFR-94-087 Daily Report 4 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA VAT Rates To Be Changed VAT Rates To Be Changed MB0505085994 Johannesburg SABC TV 1 Network in Afrikaans 1800 GMT 4 May 94 MB0505085994 Johannesburg SABC TV 1 Network Afrikaans BFN [Text] Far-reaching changes for land reforms and the lifting of tax on basic foodstuff are proposed in the ANC's agricultural policy document released today. The ANC says that a law on the restoration of land will be tabled in parliament as soon as possible. A land claims court will soon begin with its hearing on land claims. [Begin recording] [Correspondent Andre Scheepers] This court will be managed on the same basis as a supreme court. Claims being considered include cases where people were forced from their land or where they lost land according to the old apartheid laws. Utilization of unused state land will also be looked at. The court is only seen as an interim measure, and approximately 1 million people will be involved in this. Claims that will not be considered are any claims before 19 June 1913 and where land was legally confiscated. Claims not made within a certain period, to be stipulated by the president, will also not be considered. The issue of compensation could be a hotly disputed one. [ANC spokesperson Aninka Claassens, in English] In situations where people bought the land from which people...[pauses] black people had been removed, they often bought it at subsidized rates in terms of the Agricultural Credits Act, so they paid less than market value. Now what the constitution provides is that compensation will be determined according to various criteria, including market value, including the history of the acquisition and including the use to which the land is being put, so in a situation where farmers may have got land from which black people were removed, at less than market value, they won't get market value because if they did what you'd have is a situation where they profit twice from what happened under apartheid. [Scheepers] This agricultural policy is chiefly aimed at uplifting the approximately 16 million people in rural areas. The ANC says direct intervention in markets will improve and stabilize the buying power of South Africans. Among the aims: To take steps to make food affordable, the lifting of VAT [Value-Added Tax] on basic foods, increased VAT on luxury goods, investment in labor-intensive agricultural sectors, as well as in infrastructural projects such as the building of roads and irrigation schemes. Credit will be given to black farmers to enable them to obtain land. In this regard the Land Bank and other agricultural institutions will be considered. Although the ANC is in favor of deregulation the state will intervene in certain cases. Support services, research, and consumer protection services will be supplied. Environmental protection is also high on the list. There is also additional food subsidies, and in this regard the ANC aims at removing the remaining statutory powers of the agricultural councils. Land tax is also an issue to be considered. [ANC spokesman Derek Hanekom, in English] We do believe it could be a very useful policy instrument to stimulate the land market. It is used successfully in some countries in the world. We have discussed this with the South African Agricultural Union and provided them with several good arguments as to the desirability of a land tax. We would say that it has the good effect of bringing land into production. Those people who are unable to use their land properly, or fully, would be encouraged to either use it more fully or to sell off or lease off the parts of their land which they are presently not using. So we believe that it would have the dual effect of getting land onto the market as part of the land reform program, as well as stimulating greater productive use of land. [end recording]
