The ousted Viktor Linnik, former PRAVDA editor in chief, told your MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS correspondent in a telephone interview that yesterday a meeting of the editorial board was held under Ilin's chairmanship to discuss the newspaper's future. The new editor in chief formed a new lineup of the editorial board. A number of Viktor Linnik's loyalists, who were offered jobs on PRAVDA's new board, categorically rejected the offer. MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS already reported on Sunday that Linnik and a part of the newspaper's staff think the general meeting's decision on leadership change to be unlawful, because the meeting was attended by less than half of the newspaper's staffers. For the time being, however, there is dual power reigning in the publication. Both Linnik and Ilin continue to occupy their former offices -- the former, the editor in chief's; the latter, the deputy editor's. According to Ilin, from now on, thanks to straightening out the conflict with Steel Light Holding, a Greek company, the newspaper will be published daily. By the time MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS was signed into press, however, no order to print PRAVDA had been given to the Pressa publishing house's printing shops.
