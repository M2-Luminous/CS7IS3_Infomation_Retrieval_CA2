They confirmed their resolve to secure a complete military preparedness in connection with the recent North Korean military movements. The Army analyzed: North Korea is in a status in which it can launch a provocation at any time, while maintaining the highest- level combat readiness by having recently deployed to the front area long-range guns, including 170-mm self-propelled guns, and waged large-scale military exercises. On the analysis of this, while looking squarely at the reality concerning national security, the Army decided to secure military preparedness, achieve reform of consciousness, and push for the tasks of developing the Army during the latter of half of this year.
