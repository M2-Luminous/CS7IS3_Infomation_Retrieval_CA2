FR940506-0-00020 FR940506-0-00012 Nineteen parties have sought rehearing or clarification regarding some of the requirements of the rule and the standards and communication protocols. 2 The Commission grants rehearing on one issue, downloads in a standardized ASCII flat file format. The Commission had required pipelines to provide for file downloads in two formats: The first complied with established communication standards and protocols for Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and the second would have required that downloads be made available in a standardized ASCII flat file specified by the Commission. The Commission agrees with those seeking rehearing that the future of communications in the industry will be enhanced by the development of one industry standard based on established communication standards and protocols, rather than by promulgation of a second non-standardized methodology that has significant disadvantages compared with EDI. The Commission also clarifies the requirements of the rule and the protocols as discussed below. 2 The parties seeking rehearing and clarification are listed in Appendix A. II. Background and Summary of Order No. 563 In Order No. 636, 3 the Commission required pipelines to establish EBBs to provide shippers with equal and timely access to relevant information about the availability of service on their systems, including service available through capacity release transactions and firm and interruptible capacity available directly from the pipeline. 4 The Commission recognized that the efficiency of capacity allocation would be enhanced by standardizing both the content of capacity release information and the methods by which shippers could access that information. 5 3 Pipeline Service Obligations and Revisions to Regulations Governing Self-Implementing Transportation; and Regulation of Natural Gas Pipelines After Partial Wellhead Decontrol, 57 FR 13267 (Apr. 16, 1992), III FERC Stats. & Regs.

Preambles at 30,549. To facilitate the development of industry standards, the Commission established informal conferences between the staff and all interested members of the gas industry. The participants at these conferences divided their efforts into five Working Groups. 6 The Working Groups submitted a series of reports to the Commission summarizing their deliberations and the agreements reached. The Commission noticed these reports and provided an opportunity for public comment. 6 Working Groups 1 and 2 were responsible for developing data sets setting forth the information concerning available capacity. Working Group 3 was responsible for developing standards relating to business transactions between pipelines and their customers unrelated to the sale or release of capacity. Working Group 4 was responsible for developing a set of communication protocols governing the dissemination of the information. Working Group 5 was responsible for developing codes to identify companies and common transaction points.
