The American weekly, AVIATION WEEK AND SPACE TECHNOLOGY, said in its edition on the newsstands today that Albania had agreed to let the CIA fly the drones from its facilities because of Italy's refusal. After the release of a pre-publication copy of the article, the author, John Morrocco, told ANSA that a service on the same question two months ago quoted Pentagon sources as saying various countries had turned down the CIA's request. "After further research, we managed to learn that the refusal came from Italy," he added, "but we don't know why or what the motivations were." Fabbri told reporters that the denial of the facilities concerned only a question of air safety. "The remote-controlled planes would have had to use Italian airspace used by intense aviation traffic," he said, "and the risks would have been grave in case of a crash or a technical fault." He also pointed out there was no Italian or international legal framework to work within which would create not a few problems for the air traffic control authorities. Above all, Fabbri was careful to stress that he found it "frankly surprising and unacceptable" that there should have been hints of a limited spirit of collaboration by the Italian authorities when top U.S. officials recognised the "extraordinary cooperation" shown for NATO and the United States in all their operations in ex-Yugoslavia. The drones the CIA will be using are reportedly two GNAT 750's developed after the Gulf War had disclosed shortcomings in U.S. information gathering capabilities and now brought into service ahead of time to improve information collection in Bosnia. The GNAT can fly for 24 hours at a stretch to a maximum altitude of 8,000 m and with a range of 800 km, transmitting digitalised information back to base via land stations or another plane. Direct hookups with Washington are also possible, AVIATION WEEK said. The programme, which has been estimated at 6 million dollars, involves setting up a radar station in Albania with a CIA team of twelve. February 1 was initially set as the starting date, but missions may now start at the end of the month, the weekly reported.
