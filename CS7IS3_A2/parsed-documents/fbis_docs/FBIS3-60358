The Bulgarian-British Prest Project, unveiled during Mr. Baldry's visit, is intended to promote tourism in Bulgaria's protected wilderness tracts and national parks with guaranteed conservation of the natural resources. The project will be financed by the British Government's know-how fund for environmentally sustainable tourism in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The British assistance will consist mainly of equipment and experts. Yesterday, Mr. Baldry met in Bansko with the mayors of the municipalities in whose territories the two mountains rise. "The residents in the national parks' territory need not worry about the project," Environment Minister Valentin Bosevski said at Sofia Airport. According to him, people must be convinced that the implementation of a science-based and modern policy for the growth of national park tourism will lead to prosperity of the population in those areas. Mr. Bosevski and Mr. Baldry discussed opportunities for joint waste management projects. Britain promised expertise and financial support for the organization of an environment ministers' conference which will be hosted by Sofia next year.
