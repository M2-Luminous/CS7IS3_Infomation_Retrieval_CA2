China's top official dealing with Hong Kong affairs has been offering reassuring words about the future to local businessmen. But Lu Ping also says that the territory is only a value to China if it doesn't become too political. That message has not gone down well in some quarters, as Linda Lee reports. [Begin recording] [Lee] Addressing some 500 local businessmen over lunch today, Lu Ping stressed that the value of Hong Kong to China has been and will be economic. [Lu Ping] Of course, there are always a handful who are so naive as to think that they can turn Hong Kong into a political city in order to influence the mainland in the sense of politics. If that were the case, Hong Kong would be of negative value instead of positive value to China. [Patten] I don't think that you can treat Hong Kong as though it were just an economic laboratory. It is a living and thriving community with all sorts of social and political aspirations. [end recording] [Lee] Governor Patten had made himself readily available to respond to any comment from Lu Ping by scheduling a visit to Tsing Yi this afternoon. He reminded the Chinese officials that they were party to a promise to give Hong Kong greater democracy. [Patten] China itself has signed up in the Joint Declaration and in the Basic Law to a process of political development in Hong Kong, which recognizes the modest but growing aspirations of the people of the community. [Lee] But Lu Ping pointed out that the principles of One Country, Two Systems and Hong Kong People Ruling Hong Kong were designed to meet the aspirations of the community. Lu assured his audience that the territory will enjoy a high degree of autonomy. [end recording]
