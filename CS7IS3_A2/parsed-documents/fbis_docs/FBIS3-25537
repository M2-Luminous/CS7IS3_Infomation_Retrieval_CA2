Like yesterday, the COSYGA, its affiliated unions, and sympathizers went on peaceful marches throughout the country today followed by a sit-in in front of the premises of Channel One of the radio and television corporation. It was however reported that at Port Gentil, the march ended with incidents leading to the arrest of COSYGA's three provincial leaders. Albert Effam confirms this from the economic capital. [Begin recording] Paul Henri Yelo M'Boungana, COSYGA's provincial secretary for Ogooue-Maritime Province, was arrested today together with three other trade unionists following this morning's peaceful march organized by the COSYGA. The four men were detained in the early afternoon in the jails of the Gendarmerie in central Port Gentil. No official reason was given for these arrests. Questioned on these arrests by Radio (Mountie), the local officers of Port Gentil gendarmerie simply indicated that they were obeying orders and asked us as to enquire from the offices of the state attorney. Another explanation gleaned piecemeal from a source close to the gendarmerie indicated that the arrest of Paul Henri Yelo M'Boungana and his comrades could be the consequence of the incidents that marred this morning's march, especially the littering of the roadway with household garbage, the stopping of buses transporting some workers, and the deflation of tyres of stationary vehicles. According to latest reports, the Ogooue-Maritime union leader, Paul Henri Yelo M'boungana and his comrades were picked from the Gendarmerie by the Army and taken away in a military vehicle to an unknown destination. COSYGA's activists and sympathizers went to the governorate to seek an explanation in the late afternoon but Governor (Antoine Abia Gueyangoe) of Ogooue-Maritime Province was in a meeting.
