The Accord Treaty signed 28 April has given us reason to talk about the first signs of political stabilization in the country, and this process is continuing. A solemn ceremony involving major, influential organizations -- associations of industrialists, entrepreneurs, and banks -- acceding to the treaty was held 5 May in the Kremlin's Vladimir Hall. And although this time it was the premier rather than the president who was chairing it, and only the deputy heads of both chambers of parliament in the presidium, the significance of the event should not be belittled. As V. Volkov, deputy leader of the president's administration, told your IZVESTIYA correspondent, the listed associations represent a very considerable force today, not just in the economic but also in the political sphere. They include around 120 different structures, including the Union of Entrepreneurs and Leaseholders, the association of commercial banks, and industrial groups. Members of the Public Chamber, representing economic structures, will also be signing. Obviously, the question arises: Why have these associations been categorized, so to speak, as second in importance, and who determines who should be allowed to sign the treaty? According to V. Volkov, no one has set up a waiting line. At first a general decision was made to invite political parties and movements and power structures in the regions and at the federal level to sign. Political stability in society depends primarily on them. The process of acceding will subsequently be conducted as follows: When a sufficient number of applicants to sign has been collected for a ceremony to be held (applications are sent in to the organizational section, the territorial administration of the president's administration, and the Public Chamber), another ceremony will be held in the Kremlin. Representatives of youth and sports associations and certain veterans organizations will most likely be next to sign the treaty following the current ceremony. They have already submitted the relevant applications. As for rumors of the Agrarian Party's possibly acceding to this document, they are unconfirmed at present. How long can this process go on? What level of numbers and influence is acceptable for a particular organization to accede to the treaty? The representative of the president's administration was also asked these questions. He believes that the process will not degenerate to the point of absurdity. Furthermore, no one is involved in calculations about the influence and numbers of particular organizations, since such calculations would mean introducing a certain threshold of participation, whereas the aim has been different from the outset: to attract as many potential supporters of peace and accord in Russia as possible to the Treaty.
