The editor added that America does not want to see peoples free; it accuses sovereign countries of terrorism just because these countries are not under any foreign influence. He affirmed that the countries which America has accused of terrorism are the only free states in the world. That is why these states have been facing U.S. terrorism [words indistinct] for no other reason than the fact that they have rejected foreign influence and refused foreign political dictation. The editor went to say that America is an anti-peace and tyrannical power. It is behind the destruction and the havoc in the world by creating and fuelling wars and conflicts and the acquisition of biological weapons of mass destruction which are a threat to the world as a whole. It is also the source of morbid diseases facing the world today, like AIDS, through its CIA-run laboratories. The editor affirmed that America is exposed before all peoples as a state which has been practising state terrorism, supporting terrorism, and giving refuge to terrorists. It is no longer possible to fool anyone with American preaching about terrorism and peace. America is the leader of terrorism and the number one enemy of peace.
