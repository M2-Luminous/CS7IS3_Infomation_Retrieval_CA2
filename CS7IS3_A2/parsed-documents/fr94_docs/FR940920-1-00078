FR940920-1-00078 FR940920-1-00008 Today's proposal would require that valid paired CEMS hourly averages (i.e., SO 2 and O 2 (or CO 2 ), NO X and O 2 (or CO 2 ), and CO and O 2 (or CO 2 )) be obtained for 75 percent of the hours per day for 90 percent of the days per calendar quarter that the designated facility is operated and combusting MSW. G. Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Compliance Schedule Guidelines The MWC emission guidelines promulgated on February 11, 1991 for MWC's with unit capacities above 225 Mg/day established reporting and recordkeeping requirements for MWC organics (dioxins/furans), MWC metals (PM and opacity), MWC acid gases (SO 2 and HCl), and operating practices (CO, load, flue gas temperature, and operator training/certification). These reporting and recordkeeping requirements are discussed in the February 11, 1991 Federal Register notice (56 FR 5514). These same reporting and recordkeeping requirements would be adopted under the proposed guidelines, except that dioxin/furan emissions would be recorded and reported on either a total mass basis or a TEQ basis. Furthermore, if small MWC's meet the criteria in today's proposal allowing them to conduct performance tests for dioxins/furans, HCl, and PM every third year, they would submit a simplified annual report for years in which a full compliance test was not required. Today's proposal also would add reporting and recordkeeping requirements for Cd, Pb, Hg, and NO X . The proposed emission guidelines would require that initial and annual compliance reports be submitted for Cd, Pb, and Hg for MWC's at plants with capacities above 35 Mg/day. If small MWC's meet the criteria allowing them to conduct performance tests for Cd, Pb, or Hg every third year, they would be allowed to submit a simplified annual report for years when a full compliance test was not required. The proposed guidelines would also require that the amount of activated carbon injected for Hg control at small and large plants be recorded during MWC operation. The NSPS for MWC's promulgated on February 11, 1991 (56 FR 5488) establishes reporting and recordkeeping requirements for NO X for new MWC's; however, no NO X requirements were established for existing MWC's. These NSPS reporting and recordkeeping requirements would now apply to MWC's only at large plants under today's proposed emission guidelines. Submittal of initial and quarterly reports for all CEMS data and accuracy determinations for NO X emissions would be required. Quality assurance would be required in accordance with appendix F in 40 CFR part 60. Initial and annual compliance reports for fly ash/bottom ash visible emissions testing would be required under today's proposal for both small and large plants. The proposed emission guidelines include revised compliance scheduling requirements. The proposed guidelines require State plans to require both small and large MWC plants to meet one of the following two compliance schedules: (1) Full compliance with the State plan within 1 year after approval of the State plan, or (2) full compliance with the State plan within 3 years following issuance of a revised construction or operation permit, if a permit modification is required, or within 3 years following approval of the State plan, if a permit modification is not required, provided the State plan includes measurable and enforceable incremental steps of progress toward compliance with the State plan (see section IV.I of this preamble for further discussion of this requirement). The proposed emission guidelines also include an accelerated compliance schedule for compliance with the proposed dioxin/furan and Hg emission limits for certain MWC's. Under the accelerated schedule, MWC units for which construction commenced after June 26, 1987 and that are located at large MWC plants would be required to be in compliance with the proposed dioxin/furan and Hg emission guidelines within 1 year following issuance of a revised construction or operation permit, if a permit modification is required, or within 1 year following approval of the State plan, if a permit modification is not required (these units are already equipped with acid gas/PM control systems). The rationale for requiring this accelerated schedule is provided in section IV.I of this preamble. Additionally, the proposal requires compliance with both the operator training and certification requirements by 1 year after the date of promulgation of the emission guidelines. Records of all data, including results of emission tests and compliance reports would be maintained for 5 years following the date of submission of the data. III. Impacts of the Proposed Emission Guidelines This section describes the impacts (i.e., air, water, solid waste, energy, control cost, and economic impacts) of the proposed emission guidelines for small and large MWC facilities. The impacts are summarized in table 3. Table 3 presents: (1) The impact of these proposed subpart Cb guidelines over a pre-1989 baseline (i.e., baseline prior to the effective date of the subpart Ca guidelines); and (2) the incremental impact of these proposed subpart Cb guidelines over the subpart Ca guidelines. The following discussion focuses only on the impacts of today's proposal based on a pre-1989 baseline, since the emission guidelines promulgated in 1991 have not been implemented. For further information on the impacts of the proposed emission guidelines, refer to the document entitled ``Economic Impact Analysis for Proposed Emission Standards and Guidelines for Municipal Waste Combustors'' that is included in the list of items under Supplementary Information at the beginning of this preamble.
