The PF leaders included ANC President Nelson Mandela, Labour Party leader Allan Hendrickse, Transvaal Indian Congress representative Cassim Saloojee and the leaders of Lebowa, Venda, Transkei and kwaNdebele. PF co-ordinator Ismael Ibrahim said the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the April 27 elections and the PF's campaign. Mr Mandela, reacting before the meeting to Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi's threat to oppose the election process, said that while the ANC and the National Party were the major players, they were not the only ones. "Our desire is to persuade all political parties to come along with us in the process." Mr Mandela disclosed that he held talks on Wednesday with a "major personality" to broaden the inclusivity of the process. He did not name the person and asked the media not to probe for details. He said it would be regrettable if any political parties turned their backs on the negotiations process.
