Meanwhile, it has been reported that, considering President Geydar Aliyev's resistance to Moscow's wishes, Russia is worried by his upcoming visit to Ankara. It has been reported that Russia has intensified its pressure on Aliyev to force him to agree to the redeployment of two Russian military units in Azerbaijan. The two units were moved out of that republic in 1992 by former President Abulfaz Elchibey. Meanwhile, Russia has planned to base the two units in Makhachkala and Derbent in Dagestan, which is on Russia's border with Azerbaijan. The statement Aleksandr Baranov, deputy commander of Russia's border units, gave to the POST FACTUM NEWS AGENCY on 1 February revealed Russia's intention to base the two military units on Azerbaijan's border. Mirsalih Akhundly, head of the Azerbaijan Border Guards Command Press Center, has said however that Azerbaijan has not signed any agreement with Russia for the deployment of that country's military units on the Republic's border. He also asserted that Russia wishes in particular to base its military forces along Iran's and Turkey's borders. It will be recalled that in addition to diplomatic pressure, Russia has also directed military pressure toward Azerbaijan by having its military units fight on the side of the Armenians in Karabakh. Considering all that, Moscow is seriously worried by Aliyev's upcoming visit to Turkey and the possibility that he may sign a military agreement in Ankara.
