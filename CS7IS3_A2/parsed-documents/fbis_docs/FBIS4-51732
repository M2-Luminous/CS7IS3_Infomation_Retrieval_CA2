FBIS4-51732 "dreas085_c_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-085 Daily Report 1 May 1994 North Korea Envoy to Thailand: U.S. Violated Cease-Fire Envoy to Thailand: U.S. Violated Cease-Fire BK0105104194 Bangkok THE SUNDAY NATION in English 1 May 94 p A2 BK0105104194 Bangkok THE SUNDAY NATION English BFN [Excerpt] The North Korean Ambassador to Thailand, Yi To-sop, yesterday said the United States' arms build-up on the Korean Peninsula was a main reason for North Korea's call for a new peace treaty to replace the 1953 armistice agreement. In an interview with THE NATION, Yi accused the United States of "openly" violating the ceasefire agreement by sending Patriot missiles to the peninsula in addition to several other previous "covert" violations. "This is considered paralyzing the agreement," said Yi. The armistice was signed between the US command, a US-led coalition of troops from 16 Western allies, and North Korea in 1953 to halt the 1950-1953 Korean War. The two Koreas are technically still at war in the absence of a peace treaty. In reaffirming the North Korean Foreign Ministry's April 28 statement, the ambassador said a new peace treaty was necessary to establish a new peace security system and to prevent an arms build- up and the recurrence of war. Pyongyang on Thursday also proposed direct negotiations with Washington on a new treaty. The proposal was rejected by both Washington and Seoul, which said it was a tactic to divert the world's attention from nuclear tension caused by North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program. US officials said the peace accord was a matter between North and South Korea, not the United States and was a separate matter from the nuclear row. They said the settlement of the nuclear issue was an imperative. Yi also accused Washington of meddling in an inspection in March by an International Atomic Energy Agency team by presenting unacceptable conditions. The ambassador said there should be no conditions for future international nuclear inspections of North Korean nuclear facilities. Yi said the whole thing was a US ploy to pressure North Korea to open up the country and its market. This was much the same as the way the United States used human rights issues to coax China to free up its market to US products, he said. [passage omitted]
