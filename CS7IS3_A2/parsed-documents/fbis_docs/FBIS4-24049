In an attempt to accommodate their demands and defuse a potential backbencher revolt, the ANC set up a committee to re-examine the relationship between the government, the cabinet and the ANC. The decision was taken at an ANC caucus meeting ahead of a two-week sitting of Parliament called to introduce the government of national unity's first budget. A source close to the caucus said MPs had complained about being left out of key planning -- the siting of a new legislative capital for one. ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa will head the committee. Other members are Trade and Industry Minister Trevor Manuel, Posts, Telecommunications and Broadcasting Minister Pallo Jordan and MP Raymond Suttner. The committee will examine the relationship between Parliament and the cabinet, especially the practice of cabinet taking decisions and expecting MPs to fall in with the decision. Among the proposals was one that ordinary MPs be allowed to initiate their own legislation, and that MPs be allowed to vote how they wanted on issues, rather than having to toe the party line. There was also a proposal that standing committees reviewing legislation be open to the general public, not just the media. The committee would draw up a discussion document, the source said. An early issue that had some MPs up in arms was the question of a new legislative capital. MPs complained that a cabinet committee examining the issue appeared to have made up its mind without consulting them. The caucus resolved to demand that the four-person committee be expanded to take in MP's views. The source said the committee should start its work from scratch. On the introduction of constituencies to be represented by MPs, the caucus decided the issue had to be looked at in conjunction with the role of provincial legislators representing specific provinces. Mr Ramaphosa is expected to outline some of the points raised by the caucus at a media conference later this week in which he is expected to deal with the restructuring of the ANC now that it is in government.
