FR940128-2-00148 FR940128-2-00093 (b) A summary of the project (PHSIS), not to exceed one page, which provides: (1) A description of the population to be served. (2) A summary of the services to be provided. (3) A description of the coordination planned with the appropriate State and local health agencies. Executive Order 12372 The HIV Demonstration Program for Children, Adolescents, and Families has been determined to be a program which is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 concerning intergovernmental review of Federal programs by appropriate health planning agencies, as implemented by 45 CFR part 100. Executive Order 12372 allows States the option of setting up a system for reviewing applications from within their States for assistance under certain Federal programs. The application packages to be made available under this notice (Form PHS 5161&hyph;1 with revised face sheet HHS Form 424 and with Program Narrative and Checklist approved under OMB 0937&hyph;0189) will contain a listing of States which have chosen to set up such a review system and will provide a single point of contact (SPOC) in the States for review. Applicants (other than federally-recognized Indian tribal governments) should contact their State SPOCs as early as possible to alert them to the prospective applications and receive any necessary instructions on the State process. For proposed projects serving more than one State, the applicant is advised to contact the SPOC of each affected State. The due date for State process recommendations is 60 days after the application deadline for new and competing awards. The granting agency does not guarantee to ``accommodate or explain'' State process recommendations it receives after that date. (See part 148, Intergovernmental Review of PHS Programs under Executive Order 12372 and 45 CFR part 100 for a description of the review process and requirements.) (The OMB Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number for the HIV Demonstration Program for Children, Adolescents, and Families is 93.153.) Dated: December 16, 1993 John H. Kelso, Acting Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;1886 Filed 1&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4160&hyph;15&hyph;P
