During a news conference San Cristobal Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia said that they are awaiting a positive reply from subversive groups to the start of negotiations and an end to the armed confrontations. [Begin Ruiz recording] We proposed contributing our recognized moral influence; all three of us agree with that service proposal. The mediation process will depend on the parties' behavior. We hope to be able to reach the party that declared war to find out whether it accepts our mediation. What follows? We do not know, because that depends on the circumstances. All we can do is voice our willingness to serve as mediators. We will not hold talks with them, only serve as mediators of a dialogue. [end recording] The three bishops said they deeply regret the developments at the start of 1994. Deputy Government Secretary Ricardo Garcia Villalobos has reported that the Mexican Government is willing to hold talks with representatives of the subversive groups to settle this problem.
