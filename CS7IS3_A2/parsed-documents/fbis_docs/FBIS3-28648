Particularly, older politicians within the DLP, who garnished political favors from previous governments, fear that they may be excluded from party nominations of candidates for the National Assembly. The possibility of wholesale replacements was raised at the end of last month when DLP Secretary-General Mun Chong-su indicated that the party will push for a generational change in the party line-up on a gradual basis. In a report on party policies for 1994 to President Kim Yong-sam, Mun said he will try to keep the party from aging by recruiting more young people. He also pointed out that the number of DLP lawmakers in their 50s or 60s will make up nearly 90 percent of the party in 1996. As a matter of fact, the need for personnel changes within the DLP has been discussed continuously in hushed tones among reform-minded party lawmakers since the inauguration of the Kim government on a mandate of change and reform early last year. They are said to have been displeased with the failure by their party to show teamwork in carrying out in-house reform measures because of intraparty factional divisions. The DLP, a product of a three-party merger in 1990, consists of three factions with different political ideologies and backgrounds. Mun's suggestion for a generational change was in line with President Kim's recent call for a transfusion of "young blood" into the DLP through the nomination of reformist candidates for the general elections. Kim, who is also the party president, said old- fashioned politicians who have failed to adapt themselves to the new times will gradually disappear from the political community. As the DLP leaders have raised the nomination issue earlier than expected, speculation has persisted that more than 50 percent of the current DLP lawmakers will be dropped in the selection of party candidates for the Assembly elections. Party insiders predict that the expected rejectees will be those who are old and lack reform zeal, and who have been targets of public criticism for their accumulation of wealth in an illegal or immoral way. But the controversial DLP move to infuse "young blood" into the party has drawn a reaction from old politicians within the DLP, mainly from the party's two conservative factions. Displeasure with the move to replace old politicians with young newcomers erupted during a meeting of party advisers, who are senior politicians, early this month. They argued that it is wrong to allege that old politicians should retire only because they are old. DLP Chairman Kim Chong-pil, a symbol of the old-fashioned politician, was not enthusiastic about the prospect of personnel changes. He said he is willing to push for a generational change but noted it is desirable that the experience of the old and the vigor of the young are harmonized in politics. The dispute surrounding replacement of old politicians with young newcomers has already intensified conflicts between factions within the DLP. The two conservative groups have been uneasy over the possibility of personnel changes. They said the move was engineered by their rival reform-minded faction made up of relatively young politicians in order to grab party hegemony. But the reformists, loyal to President Kim, stressed the need for a large-scale replacement of old politicians with young reformists, saying that party candidates for the general elections should be fresh figures befitting the new era of reform.
