FBIS3-28348 "dreas025_a_94038" FBIS-EAS-94-025 Document Type:Daily Report 7 February 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Poll: Public Welcomes Political Reforms OW0502032294 OW0502032294 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Tokyo Asahi Television Network in Japanese at 0207 GMT on 30 January, in its regularly-scheduled "Sunday Project" program, which begins at 0100 GMT, announces in a two-minute report the results of a nationwide telephone poll conducted earlier during the program. Announcer Kayoko Miyata says that responses were obtained from 929 eligible voters. The number of respondents to each question is not given, however. All polling figures are as heard. In the wake of the Diet's approval of the political reform bills, an unidentified poller earlier asked pollees several questions on their reactions toward the enactment of the bills, as well as their views on economic trends. In response to the first question, which asks whether the respondents support the Diet's approval of the political reform bills, 72.2 percent of pollees say "yes," 14.4 percent say "no," and 13.3 percent say they "do not know." On the same question, 68.6 percent of pollees who are supporters of the Social Democratic Party of Japan say "yes," 17.1 percent say "no," and 14.3 percent say they "do not know." When the pollees are asked if they have become more confident about the nation's politics after observing the process of the debates on political reform, the largest group, 33.5 percent, says that their attitude toward politics "remains unchanged" even after the reform bills have been enacted. Moreover, 33.4 percent say that their confidence in politics has been "damaged" through the process of debates. Only 17.9 percent say that they "became more confident about politics," while 8.9 percent say they "have no interest in politics," and 4.3 percent say they "do not know." On a question which asks how the enactment of the bills is affecting the stagnant economy, 66 percent say that this "cannot boost the economy," and 26 percent say that it "might bring about some signs of an economic recovery." Only 3.7 percent say that this will "boost the economy," and 4 percent give other responses or the "do not know" answer. Miyata next says that 76.9 percent of those polled expressed support for the Hosokawa cabinet. The report then ends.
