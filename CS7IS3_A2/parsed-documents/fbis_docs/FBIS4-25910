After his talks with his visiting Vietnamese Counterpart Nguyen Manh Cam, Kozyrev recalled in an interview with reporters that Russia has proposed holding an international conference on security and nuclear-free status of the Korean peninsula. This idea is now under consideration, he added. "There has been a proposal to impose sanctions. We do not rule out the possibility, quite unfortunately, that it may come to that. But it would be a very unreasonable development of the situation. It would be also unreasonable if North Korea (DPRK) withdraws from the nuclear non-proliferation regime," the Russian foreign minister added. "I think that not all chances have been lost and there is still hope that this door has not been closed yet," he said.
