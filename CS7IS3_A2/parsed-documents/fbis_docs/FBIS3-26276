These businesses were selected from the province's state-run companies, township enterprises and joint ventures at the beginning of 1992, each with an output value of above 50 million yuan and profits and tax turnover of more 5 million yuan. Cao Guixing, director of the provincial economic committee, attributed the rapid growth to their good operation, high efficiency and market-oriented products. Their average output value is expected to be more than 100 million yuan within several years. For example, the output value of Shenyang Feilong Health Goods Ltd has jumped from some 100 million yuan in 1992 to 870 million yuan last year. Cao said some businesses, which lagged behind in tough competition, will be removed from the "small giants" list. He also said that if there are more and more businesses which qualify, the number can surpass 100. Liaoning is one of China's important heavy industrial bases, which embraces 1,261 medium and large-sized enterprises, accounting for one-tenth of China's total.
