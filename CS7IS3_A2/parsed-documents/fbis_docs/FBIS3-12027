Presidential spokesman Fernando Costa said the government will comply with any STF ruling on the matter. He noted, however, that a ruling against the government would undermine the chances of success of the economic stabilization plan launched by Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Sindilegis filed a petition for an injunction to force the government to transfer the funds required to cover the 10.94 percent increase obtained by the judicial branch and by Congress by converting their salaries to URV's [Real Value Units] on the 20th instead on the 30th of each month. The government wants all salaries to be converted into URV's on the 30th. According to the spokesman, if the STF does not pass a ruling on the case by 30 March, the government will reissue Provisional Measure 434, which created the URV and set up guidelines for converting salaries into URV's. Franco's major concern now is that an STF ruling in favor of Sindilegis could encourage other public servants to file similar petitions demanding a 10.94 percent increase. In this case, the spokesman said, the government will face serious difficulties because it would not have sufficient funds to cover these salary increases. Executive branch employees' salaries are converted into URV's on the 30th. Ambiguities in Provisional Measure 434 and different interpretations of the law have caused the STF to follow another formula for converting its salaries into URV's, thus provoking an impasse. Congress, the government, and the STF have until 30 March, when the 30-day period following the issuance of the provisional measure expires, to reach an agreement to end this confrontation. For instance, Congress may rule that a provisional measure establishing that salaries must be converted into URV'S on the 30th applies not only to the executive branch but to the legislative and judicial branches as well. This solution would preclude a re-issuance of the measure by the executive branch.
