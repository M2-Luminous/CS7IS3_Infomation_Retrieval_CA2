During the meeting, President Kim conferred the Order of Diplomatic Service Merit, Kwanghwa Medal, on the Spanish minister before exchanging opinions on ways to further promote bilateral cooperation. The president especially thanked Minister Solana for the support his country, as a non-permanent member country of the U.N. Security Council, extended to South Korea over the North Korean nuclear issues. Meanwhile, at a press conference Minister Solana said the North Korean nuclear issues should be resolved in a rightful direction in the interests of world security. Solana said it is desirable that the nuclear question will be settled before the need arises for the U.N. Security Council to take a sanction. Also saying that there is a growing need of cooperation between Korea and Spain in the areas of international politics and economy, Minister Solana expressed the hope that his visit would contribute much to expanding friendly cooperative ties between the two countries. The Spanish minister flew into Seoul on Sunday [16 January] for a three-day official visit. He was the first Spanish foreign minister ever to visit Seoul since the two countries entered ambassadorial relations in 1950.
