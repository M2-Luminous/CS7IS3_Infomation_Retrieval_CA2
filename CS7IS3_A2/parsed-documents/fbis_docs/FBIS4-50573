He said: On the whole, the state of economic development is improving, and the fast growth in industrial production, investment, consumption, and commodity prices has slowed down somewhat. This is a good trend. However, great attention must be paid to certain economic problems. Efforts to control inflation, in particular, should not be slackened. Wei Liqun said: The many major reform measures announced this year are being carried out normally. The plans that the State Council put forward early this year for reforming financial operations, taxation, monetary affairs, and the systems governing investment, foreign exchange, and foreign trade are being implemented. Central and local taxes have been separated in most prefectures and counties. Tax reform is proceeding steadily. Under the new tax system, receipts and payments maintained their normal growth during the January-April period, and the budget was being executed according to plan. The reform of the monetary system was proceeding on the basis of the principle of separating policy-based [zheng ce xing 2398 4595 1840] monetary affairs from commercial monetary affairs. The National Development Bank has been officially established, and preparations for setting up other policy-based banks have been intensified. Foreign exchange reforms during the first quarter included the consolidation of foreign exchange rates, recalling foreign exchange coupons, and establishing counter accounts [tai zhang 0669 1600] for export businesses. The exchange rate between the dollar and the renminbi has been maintained at approximately 1:8.7. The nation's foreign exchange revenue has grown quite substantially. Banks have been converting and selling foreign exchange since 1 April. Ever since it began to operate on 4 April, foreign exchange dealings between domestic banks and foreign banks have been active at the Chinese Foreign Exchange Trade Center, whose main traders are banks authorized to provide foreign exchange service; and the amounts of foreign exchange converted have been greater than the amounts of foreign exchange sold. Pilot reform projects of establishing modern businesses have also started. On the whole, the economy is developing according to requirements set for the exercise of macroeconomic regulation and control. Since early this year, the economy has continued to maintain its fast growth, with some decline. The first quarter's GDP was 12.7 percent higher than the same period last year. That included the 5.5-percent increase for primary industry, the 15.8-percent increase for secondary industry, and the 7.9-percent increase for tertiary industry. -- Agricultural production is warming up. Following the two conferences sponsored by the central government to discuss rural affairs and the national conference on "food basket" projects, all local authorities have grown grain and cotton on all designated acreage, have increased investment in projects that support agricultural production, and have hastened to build vegetable and nonstaple food bases in large and medium cities. Farmers' enthusiasm for production has been aroused. -- Industrial production has been maintaining its relatively fast growth. The value added of the nation's industrial production during the January-April period topped that of the same period last year by 16.4 percent, and the sales rates of goods were maintained at 92.2 percent. The excessively low growth of state-owned industrial enterprises has also started to change. In April, the total industrial output value of state-owned industrial enterprises increased 5 percent, or nearly three percentage points higher than the figure for the first quarter. -- The monetary situation has been stable. By 28 March, the amount of currency issued from New Year's Day to the period around the Spring Festival had all been withdrawn from circulation, and the withdrawal was still continuing at the end of April. Compared with the same period last year, savings deposits by urban and rural residents during the January-April period increased by more than 130 billion yuan. Since the treasury bonds were floated to the public on 1 April, over half had been purchased by 10 May. -- The sharp rise of investment in fixed assets has been somewhat restrained. The increase in investment in fixed assets has continued to decline. During the January-April period, the amount of money which state-owned units invested in fixed assets was 38.4 percent higher than that of the same period last year, but the size of increase [zeng fu 1073 1607] was 30.5 percentage points lower than that of the same period last year. On the whole, the investment structure was better than that of the same period last year. Compared to last year, the capital needed for priority projects was more readily available. -- The domestic market is basically stable. Total retail sales of consumer goods during the January-April period were 25 percent higher than for the same period last year. After being adjusted for price factors, the actual growth was 4.2 percent. Currently, the supply and demand of at least 90 percent of commodities are basically balanced, or with the supply being greater than the demand. Owing to the strict control of the size of investment, sales of capital goods have been stable. -- Foreign trade has been growing steadily. During the January-April period, total exports reached $28.04 billion, or 22 percent higher than for the same period last year. The growth in April -- the month in which the growth of exports exceeded imports for the first time since September 1992 -- was 29.6 percent higher than for April 1993. Total imports during the January-April period increased 20.3 percent, reaching $29.79 billion. -- The dramatic rise of commodity prices was brought under preliminary control. The rise of commodity prices slowed down noticeably in March. The monthly link relative index [yue huan bi zhi shu 2588 3883 3024 2172 2422] dropped from over 3 percent in January and February to 0.9 percent. As result of tightening the monitoring of the prices of basic necessities and services, promoting the practice of marking prices openly, and carrying out a nationwide price check, prices have become less disorderly than before. Wei Liqun said: According to preliminary estimates, compared to the same period last year, the GDP of the first six months will be about 12 percent higher, the total industrial output value will grow by about 18 percent, state-owned units' investment in fixed assets will grow by about 30 percent, and total retail sales of consumer goods will increase by about 22 percent, and the price rises will continue to slow down during the second quarter. He added: The current economic situation shows that while certain problems appearing during the fast economic growth in the past two years have become less serious in one way or another, the foundation for balancing economic aggregates is not very strong, and the leeway for macroeconomic regulation and control is limited, and thus considerable time is still needed before structural problems and ineffective operating mechanisms created over a long period of time in the past can be resolved. Thus, over the next few months, the intensity in exercising macroeconomic regulation and control must be maintained and all plans must be carried out cautiously, meticulously, and firmly.
