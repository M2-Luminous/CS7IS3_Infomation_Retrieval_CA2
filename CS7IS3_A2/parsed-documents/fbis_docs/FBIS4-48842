However, there is some relative hope now for securing an end to the current nightmare. Finally, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], which has been marching down on Kigali, has accepted to resume talks with its enemies. RPF spokesman Jean-Baptiste Gawumba speaks on the issue. [Begin recording] [Gawumba] We have always maintained that we agree to negotiate with the government Armed Forces in order to stop the massacres. Right from the beginning our standpoint was made known not only to the international community but also to the government forces themselves. Some conditions were set to ensure the success of the negotiations with the government forces. So, this is not the first time that we are accepting to negotiate with the government forces to get them to put an end to the massacre of the people. However, we do not think we are making this condition -- stopping the massacres -- a prerequisite for negotiations . [Unidentified correspondent] Zaire's President Mobutu has recommended the demilitarization of Kigali, the Rwandan capital. [Gawumba] Look, I believe we said we belong to a country that enjoys national sovereignty. We do not believe that the proposal of demilitarized areas can be imposed. As far as we are concerned, we cannot accept the proposed demilitarization of either the airport or RPF-controlled areas. [end recording]
