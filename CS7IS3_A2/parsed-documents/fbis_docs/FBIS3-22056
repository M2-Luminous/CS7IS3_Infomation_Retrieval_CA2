This is why trafficking gangs are now hijacking the trucks that transport these chemicals. The police have reported that 20 to 25 tons of sulfuric acid have already been stolen by criminal gangs. The police source said that links have been established between the gangs that attack these trucks and trafficking gangs. Since the middle of last year there has been close coordination between the Industry Ministry, the National Customs Administration Superintendency, and the Antidrug Division (Dinandro) over the importation of chemical products. In the past few weeks Dinandro agents discovered that two gangs are hijacking trucks that transport chemical products used to prepare cocaine base. It has been established that the stolen chemicals were sold to trafficking gangs that manufacture cocaine. Several attacks on trucks transporting sulfuric acid from Centromin Peru [Central Peru Mining Enterprise] were reported recently in Cerro de Pasco and La Oroya. The police have said that traffickers are paying $16 per liter for sulfuric acid when its normal price is $1. The police are trying to break this connection between common criminals and traffickers in an effort to prevent this from becoming a new method to escape police control on chemical products used to manufacture drugs in Peru.
