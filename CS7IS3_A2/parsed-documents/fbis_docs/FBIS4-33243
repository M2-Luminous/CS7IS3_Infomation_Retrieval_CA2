The sources did not give the identity of the people who left the embassy last night, nor the identity of the person who left Sunday night. Observers believe the four who left the residence of the Belgian ambassador could be the last people who were unexplainably able to break through dozens of police on Saturday morning. In documents released to the media on Tuesday, the refugees expressed their suspicions that the four were State Security agents.
