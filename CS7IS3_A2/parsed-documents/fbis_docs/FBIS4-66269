Thanks to their efforts, the task across the country has produced some results. I. Major Steps Taken To Stop Losses, Increase Profits In 1993, all localities and departments continued to implement the State Council's "Circular on Launching an In-Depth Campaign To Stop Losses and Increase Profits for Enterprises" in accordance with the arrangements made by the State Economic and Trade Commission and the Ministry of Finance [ETC]. They have accumulated some quite successful experiences and methods in the following six main areas: First, they implemented a system for key leaders to undertake responsibility as well as a responsibility system to meet preset targets for stopping losses. The former system, which held key leaders at all levels personally responsible for stopping losses and increasing profits, was an organizational arrangement to guarantee that this task received unremitting attention at all times. Under this system, leaders undertook the responsibility for improving the operations of big loss-suffering enterprises. They reached deep into the reality and conscientiously helped the enterprises solve the difficulties and problems encountered in production and operations. Meanwhile, based on the loss-stopping work assigned by the state, all localities and departments instituted a system where work targets were set up for fulfillment at prefectural and county levels and by the trades and enterprises concerned. As a result, all levels were required to meet certain targets. Their work was reviewed periodically, and an evaluation report was published every month. Successful units in meeting the targets were given awards, while those failing to do so were penalized. And each level was accountable to the next higher level. Second, efforts were made to increase the internal reforms and strengthen the management of enterprises. While implementing the "Regulations on Transformation of Operational Mechanism of Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People," all localities and departments tried to learn from and popularize the Handan Steel Plant's experience, namely, to put the stress on tapping potentials within the enterprises as a way to stop losses and increase profits. More efforts were devoted to cost control and quota management. Separate accounting systems were carried out for different levels. Each unit within the enterprise was held responsible for the effect of its work on the enterprise's profits and losses. Attention was paid to reducing material consumption and minimizing loss and waste. In addition, the three systems within enterprises were reformed, while a risk-protection mechanism and an incentive mechanism were set up to improve the efficiency of management. As to those enterprises that had long been in the red and whose assets could not cover the liabilities, action was taken as the case required--this included closing down the enterprises, suspending their operations, merging them with others, switching them to other lines of production, and adjusting their production, product mix, or organizational structure. Third, particular attention was given to improving big loss-suffering enterprises and dealing with their problems on a case by case basis. Based on investigations and studies, all localities and departments classified the loss-suffering enterprises into different groups according to the nature of their problems and decided on the priority in dealing with them. They worked out a list of big loss-suffering enterprises and made diagnostic plans after consulting with the parties concerned. Different measures were taken for different factories. Specific support was given to certain enterprises with a view to helping them stop losses and increase profits. In addition, the state and local economic and trade commissions (or economic commissions or planning and economic commissions in some localities; the same below) paid particular attention to the work of stopping losses and increasing profits for 300 selected enterprises in various parts of the country. They conducted follow-up checks on these enterprises and monitored their operations on a periodical basis. Fourth, a loss-stopping fund was set up to help loss-suffering enterprises to stop their losses. In many localities, the financial department or the bank set aside a certain amount of money to establish such a fund. Its purpose was to assist hopeful enterprises in developing new products and conducting low-cost technological upgrading. Sometimes, the fund was used to fill up a temporary shortage of working capital or to pay interest on loans. This provided a favorable condition for loss-suffering enterprises to stop their losses. Fifth, efforts were made to increase production and boost revenue by relying on advance in science and technology. Some localities and departments, on the one hand, pooled financial resources to help loss-suffering enterprises to upgrade their equipment and manufacturing processes with a view to fully tapping their own potentials. On the other hand, they encouraged loss-suffering enterprises to benefit from advanced science and technology, adopt new manufacturing processes, use new technology and equipment, and speed up the development of new products and the adjustment of their product mix. This way the enterprises could turn out quality and marketable products to compete with others so as to achieve the objective of stopping losses. Sixth, all-out efforts were made to develop the tertiary industry and diversified operations. Apart from the above, the state adopted a series of new policies and measures to help eliminate losses suffered by some trades because of certain policies implemented in the past. This assisted greatly in promoting the 1993 work of stopping losses and increasing profits for enterprises. II. Plan for Stopping Losses and Increasing Profits in 1994 The 1994 target for stopping losses and increasing profits for enterprises is to bring down the percentage of loss-suffering enterprises among the industrial enterprises contained in the state budget by 5 percentage points and to cut their total amount of losses by 10 percent compared with the 1993 records. To ensure the success of the 1994 work, all localities and departments are requested to do the following: A) It is imperative to stress the responsibility for stopping enterprises' losses and continue to give them proper guidance according to the nature of their problems. All localities and departments should strengthen their leadership in organizing the work of stopping losses and increasing profits. They should continue the target responsibility system and set specific targets for the above-mentioned work to be met by various units and enterprises. They should see to it that clear-cut targets are assigned, and the individuals concerned are held responsible for the fulfillment of these targets. The management of all enterprises should make a list of their big loss-suffering units, investigate and study the problems in each case, and work out solutions. Different solutions should be used for different factories, and deadlines should be set for them to correct their problems. All loss-suffering enterprises are required to form a loss responsibility mechanism and link the interests of their staff members and workers to the results they achieved in reducing and stopping losses as a way of reward or punishment. In addition, the economic and trade commissions, financial and audit departments, and the enterprise management should conduct periodical supervision and inspection of the work of stopping losses and increasing profits. Regarding those loss-suffering enterprises whose performance is being followed up by the State Economic and Trade Commission, key leaders of local economic and trade commissions should be personally responsible for helping them solve practical problems and prompting them to stop or reduce losses as soon as possible. B) More efforts should be devoted to operational management and to the tapping of potentials within enterprises. All localities and departments should make further efforts to learn from and popularize the Handan Steel Plant's experience and continue to gear up and improve the operational management of enterprises. It is important at present to beef up basic management, cost control, and the improvement of work shifts and groups. All localities and departments should institute a sound quota management procedure as well as other regulations, rules, and standards, and implement a strict performance evaluation system, using the management standards of domestic and foreign advanced enterprises as a reference. In addition, they should seriously implement the "General Financial Guidelines for Enterprises" and the "Guiding Principles for Enterprise Accounting," improve the economic accounting within enterprises, strictly enforce the budget system and financial work discipline, and lower all costs and expenses. C) Enterprises should be dealt with on their merits. Those hopeful of improvement should be given support. In the first place, where conditions permit, local authorities and departments in charge of the specific trades should continue to put money into and make proper use of the loss-stopping fund. The fund should be used mainly for construction of small technological upgrading projects that can be applied to production within this year, are suited to small- and medium-sized enterprises, and can yield quick economic results. It should also be used to support loss-suffering enterprises in developing new products and to meet their needs for short-term working funds. Second, in budgeting and using various technological-transformation funds, the economic and trade commissions, as well as financial and banking departments, should set aside a certain amount for supporting loss-suffering enterprises in stopping their losses. Third, based on the inventory of the assets held by loss-suffering enterprises, plans should be worked out to solve the lingering problems left from the past. Fourth, after adopting the measure of granting loans to enterprises based on their asset-to-liability ratio, banks should make some interim arrangements to support those hopeful enterprises in improving their production and operations and to assist certain loss-suffering enterprises in accelerating their product-mix adjustment. Presently, the State Economic and Trade Commission is consulting with the departments concerned in formulating concrete measures for loss-suffering enterprises to obtain working-fund loans during the transitional period. D) Transformation of the enterprise operational mechanism should be put in high gear. Continued efforts should be made to implement the "Regulations on Transformation of Operational Mechanism of Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People" and "Regulations on Supervision and Management of Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People" to breakthrough adjusting the enterprise structure. Enterprises that conform to the state's industrial policy, are hopeful of improvement, and have a good market for their products, can be leased or sold to others, or merged with others. For those that have suffered losses for a long time with no hope of improvement, having more liabilities than assets, resolute action should be taken to allow them to apply for bankruptcy. In this way, we will be able to adjust our enterprise structure and fundamentally correct the mechanisms that cause losses to enterprises. E) All-out efforts should be made to promote technological progress and further improve product quality. All localities and departments should energetically assist loss-suffering enterprises in importing advanced technology, improving manufacturing processes, using new materials and substitutes, achieving more effective utilization of energy and raw materials, and minimizing the material consumed for making each unit of product. Meanwhile, they should make positive efforts to organize and mobilize all staff members and workers to join the qualify control campaign and see to it that quality control is conducted at every step of the production process. For this purpose, strict metrological controls, acceptance tests, and quality-monitoring procedures should be put into effect at every link of production and operations. Loss-suffering enterprises should be encouraged to develop competitive and quality products so as to achieve the goal of stopping losses and increasing profits. F) A wide-scale and in-depth campaign for "double increase and double economy" [campaign to increase production and practice economy and to increase revenues and retrench expenditures] should be launched. All enterprises are requested to carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, diligence, and frugality. Party and government departments, trade unions, Communist Youth League organizations, and women's federations should all make concerted efforts with one mind, rely fully on the masses, and arouse their initiative and creativity to develop extensive and in-depth activities to "increase production and practice economy and to increase revenues and retrench expenditures," so as to achieve substantial results in stopping losses and increasing profits for enterprises. This year, the deepening of enterprise reform and the implementation of various reform measures will bring a drastic change to the external environment and the operational mechanism of enterprises. This will have a positive effect on improving the operations of our state-owned enterprises. On the other hand, however, enterprises will be confronted with new questions. In particular, those enterprises with more problems left from the past and greater difficulties in their operations will find it hard to completely adapt themselves to the new economic system and the new changes in the market. Thus, all localities and departments should proceed with enterprise reform in a deep-going and down-to-earth way as required by the "Resolution" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. They should guide enterprises to gear their operations to the market, beef up their management, make internal improvement, and quicken their pace of structural adjustment. In addition, they should lead enterprises to raise economic efficiency, improve quality in every respect, and strive hard to intensify the campaign for stopping losses and increasing profits.
