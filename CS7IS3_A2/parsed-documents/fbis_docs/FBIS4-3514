This was disclosed at the end of the Sino-British Land Commission meeting here on Hong Kong's 1994-95 land disposal program and comes as the government is attempting to contain real estate values which, property experts say, now rival those in Tokyo. Britain and China will release 117 hectares (289 acres) of land for private commercial development and public housing -- 10 hectares (24.7 acres) less that the 127.8 hectares (315.8 acres) released in the last fiscal year. Tony Eason, head of the British team, said the team had "positive and cooperative" discussions on the need to ease the land shortage that is in part a cause of the territory's soaring property prices. Property prices have rise nearly 200 percent over the past three years, with home ownership now out of the reach of at least 50 percent of households. "We expect the market to see it as a positive step towards injecting additional supply into the market," Eason said. Governor Chris Patten's recent pledge to act on property prices has triggered a 10-to-15 percent drop in asking rents since the Easter holiday and a 60 percent decline in recorded property transactions, property analysts said. Several factors have been cited for the rising prices, including negative interest rates, growing demand from young families, an influx of foreign companies doing business with China, and speculation by Chinese state firms.
