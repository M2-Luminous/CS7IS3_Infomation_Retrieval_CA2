Fung Kin-kee, chairman of the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood, said, "This provides me a good chance to have direct dialogue with the Chinese Government. I will give different views if it is necessary." James Wong, a noted composer and a critic, said: "I was much surprised to hear about the news of my being invited to serve as a Hong Kong affairs adviser. This shows the Chinese Government is enlightened, open-minded and ready to listen to different views." Chao How-chen, chairman of the Tsuen Wan district board and a member of the regional council, said Hong Kong is confronted with a wide scope of complicated issues in the latter half of the transitional period. The Chinese side should solicit views from all social stratum. He advised the Chinese Government to have regular meetings and make in-depth discussion of Hong Kong affairs. Wan Lam, deputy general-secretary of the new territories communities, said, "As a member of the third batch of Hong Kong affairs advisers, I will, as always, voice the opinions of residents and fishermen in the new territories and do a bit for the prosperity of Hong Kong." He believes the Chinese Government is capable of making a smooth transfer of power in Hong Kong even if no cooperation from the British side. Wang Siu-yee, member of the Kowloon city district board, said, the most important thing for a Hong Kong affairs adviser to do is to let the Chinese Government know what is happening in Hong Kong and what the Hong Kong residents need. For instance, he said, "A sharp gap between the rich and poor is a big issue in Hong Kong. I will forward views in this respect to the Chinese Government." In view of the fact that the Sino-British negotiation on the 1994-95 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong terminated, he suggested that the preliminary work committee should speed up work in various fields and work out a set of policies in the interests of both Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland through soliciting a wide spectrum of views.
