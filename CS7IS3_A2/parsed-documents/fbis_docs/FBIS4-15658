Feelings are running high. The State Duma intends to hold a hearing on this key problem in the near future. Will the State Committee for the Management of State Property be able to defend its approach to distributing state property? [Razin] For many, the public conflict between Chubays and Luzhkov has been like a bolt from the blue, in my opinion. Do you accept that it could just be a personality clash? [Chubays] Initially, I too thought that the experienced economist was irritated by the vigorous actions of the "Chicago boys in pink trousers." But that illusion was soon shattered. By attempting to torpedo the voucher, Luzhkov wants to place the sale of shares under bureaucrats' control and make it so expensive that, in the end, privatization will drag on for decades -- to the satisfaction of all who cherish the hope of returning Russia to the era of "developed socialism." [Razin] Are you not being too harsh in your judgments? [Chubays] Why is it then that major investment funds like "Alfa-Kapital" have invested only 3 percent of their resources in the privatization of Moscow enterprises? The reason is simple: Privatization in Moscow and a number of regions is being blocked by local authorities. Unfortunately, while he does not have the power to abolish vouchers, Luzhkov is in a position to slow down the process. But the State Committee for the Management of State Property has sufficient levers to enable Muscovites to invest their checks in the capital's most promising ventures. I think the State Committee's plans will get massive support from below.... [Razin] In my opinion, the voucher's main purpose is not to effect nationwide privatization, but to create the conditions whereby the state sector can be transferred to commercial structures' private ownership as quickly as possible.... [Chubays] All world experience shows that no more than 10-15 percent of the population may become efficient owners. Where are we to find these enterprising people capable of transforming loss-making plants into profitable firms? There is only one way to solve this problem: Through natural selection. Consequently, at the start of the voucher marathon we deliberately placed everyone on equal terms, without dividing them into partocrats and democrats, conservatives and reformers. Everyone was given a voucher and told: Do with it what you will! Sell it, rip it up, buy another 100 or 1,000, get interested in macroeconomics and investments.... It very soon became clear that the vouchers were being amassed by people who can and want to work with them. We estimate that the desired 10-15 percent of efficient owners have been found. They will probably include former Union ministers, directors of state enterprises, and young entrepreneurs, who head more than 600 check investment funds, incidentally. Of course, not all these funds will be able to stand up to the competition: Some of them may go bankrupt. But, as a whole, it is quite clear that a market mechanism, which will absorb financial resources and pump investments into industry, has been created in Russia in just 12-18 months. [Razin] But where are these fabulous investments going to come from? There is no sign of them at present.... [Chubays] You should look more closely. The Volga Motor Vehicle Plant hit upon the idea of collecting colossal amounts of money to fund the AVVA project. This is one version of the breakthrough: Citizens' savings are drawn into industry via the mechanism of expanding joint-stock companies' authorized capital. Another, no less well-known example is "Olbi-Diplomat." These are intelligent people who basically collect billions of rubles for television advertizing alone -- money which, if it were not invested in the economy, would simply lie idle. These two examples point to a chain reaction of even more attractive projects, including some which involve Western capital. Hundreds of investment funds and thousands of joint-stock industrial enterprises are destined to engage in this kind of business; even now, they are finding mutual benefit in cooperation at check auctions. [Razin] But check auctions will "die" with the voucher on 1 July, which is less than 100 days away.... [Chubays] Check auctions will be succeeded by money auctions, which will allow enterprises to attract even more investments for their development by means of selling shares. [Razin] Is it not the case that the mafia will simply buy up the most profitable enterprises with its easy money? [Chubays] On completion of check privatization, enterprises' fixed capital will have a much higher value. It goes without saying that labor collectives which are dragging their heels over selling shares risk losing many of the current benefits and waking up one morning to a new owner in the shape of a commercial bank or fund. [Razin] Is that why giants like "Gazprom" and a number of leading petroleum extraction companies have started rushing into check auctions? [Chubays] Whatever, it is certainly no accident that "Gazprom" has collected several million vouchers from all over the country to take part in its own auction. After 1 July, shares which can now be bought with these checks will be 10 times more expensive.... [Razin] Suppose voucher privatization ends successfully in 100 days time. Will all its pluses not be concealed by financial-industrial groups, which officials of all colors have suddenly begun to discuss? Is this venture not a trick to keep bankrupt enterprises afloat? [Chubays] I am skeptical of attempts to unite quite different enterprises on orders from above. Economic councils like these will collapse under pressure from internal conflicts. But this idea could forge a path for itself if shareholders from various sectors and commercial structures want to combine their efforts to stabilize financial and industrial ties. I think we will hear of such examples quite soon. [Razin] I would very much like to share your optimism. But I am not convinced by predictions or promises, only by hard facts. The voucher privatization stage has been completed in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. What is the situation there with investments in industry? [Chubays] The Czech economics minister told me during a recent meeting that the Czech Republic has been flooded with so many investments -- both from within the country and from abroad -- that the government no longer knows what to do with them. The total capital exceeds all conceivable limits. The population is also convinced of the success of voucher privatization, as the dividends from investing coupons (the Czech equivalent of our vouchers) amount to more than three or four months' wages, and wages in the Czech Republic are comparable to those received in the West. I am convinced that the Czech Republic had the highest industrial growth rate of all the European countries last year. Admittedly, this success was made possible not only by optimum privatization, but also by financial stabilization. They are two sides of the same coin. In conjunction, these two factors have an astounding effect. [Razin] Will we soon see something similar in Russia? [Chubays] The Czechs began their reforms 18-24 months earlier than us. So Russia still has everything ahead.... Recently the prime minister publicly lambasted some heads of laboratory who allegedly confused Russia with a racing car: They drove it around for a while and then abandoned it. Something similar can be seen in readers' letters: Surely Gaydar has not abandoned the reforms? Gaydar has been criticized with unconcealed hatred on all sides. But many people treat him with understanding, because he was not cunning and took all the flak. However hard life may be for Russians, in the past two years the reforms have reached the "point of no return" and become irreversible. You must agree that it is nevertheless better to live in Russia at present than in Ukraine, say, where they have tried to boost the economy with "other, nonmonetarist methods".... Gaydar resigned because he did not like playing the role of whipping boy in the government. But he did not abandon the reforms when he resigned: He has remained in politics. Our main task now is to complete privatization and create a broad class of owners: The middle class that will serve as a firm social foundation for the economic reforms. Only on this basis will it be possible to form a strong political party capable of shaking the Russian economy out of its comatose state. Strictly speaking, with no real support from below, even under the president's wing it will be impossible to contain lobbyist storms for long.... [Razin] Do you not think that the reformers have gone too far with their tough financial policy? Is this not the reason why you recently had to be appointed vice premier over the prime minister's head? The president has had to show his fist in order to defend check privatization.... [Chubays] I do not agree that the presidential edict on my appointment was signed over the prime minister's head. This document was drawn up with Chernomyrdin's consent. It just happens that my appointment was passed separately from the general list.... [Razin] It looks as if Yeltsin has thereby made it clear to anyone interested that voucher privatization will be taken to its logical conclusion. [Chubays] That was probably the intention. [Razin] Sorry, but are you sure you will be able to complete voucher privatization? You are rather out on a limb in the present government, and it is strongly rumored in the State Duma that you will soon be removed altogether.... [Chubays] A year or 18 months ago, I found these questions difficult. Virtually every day began with the feeling that I only had a week left. Breaking through the redoubts of the old parliament was like crossing a minefield. The situation has now fundamentally changed. Even fierce opponents of check privatization -- such as Luzhkov, for example -- blame the State Committee for the Management of State Property for the fact that directors have become our allies. This is absolutely true. First, we have made the process of selling shares extremely simple by removing the armada of officials. Second, we have given state enterprises the chance to use their vouchers to buy a major shareholding without being robbed by a revaluation of their fixed capital. That is why Luzhkov's version has not been adopted. The Moscow mayor has tried to increase the cost of state enterprises hundreds of times over, abolish check auctions, and hold only money auctions in their place. If this were to happen, Luzhkov would have some serious explaining to do with workers at the Likhachev Plant, the Volga Motor Vehicle Plant, and thousands of other enterprises: They would want to know why shares had become 400 times more expensive and why they could no longer be bought with vouchers, but only with cash -- of which there is not enough even to pay wages. I would like to see the results of these talks.... Of course, opposition to privatization is still very strong. But centers of sabotage now only remain in the corridors of power: The voucher is opposed by the former party-economic nomenklatura, big lobbies of officials, and a number of political parties which act as a mouthpiece for their interests. Some will lose a very great deal from the real redistribution of property in favor of economic efficiency. But it is no longer officials who call the shots: It is the person with the voucher. Try and take it away from him, and you will be in real trouble! When the affair with the "Tekhnicheskiy Progress" Joint-Stock Company came to light, its shareholders became a seething mob prepared to sweep aside anyone in their path. That is why I am convinced that no forces or shady structures now have the power to stop the process of privatization....
