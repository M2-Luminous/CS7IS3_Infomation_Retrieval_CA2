According to Zhirinovskiy, membership of NATO would turn Finland into an enemy of Russia. Zhirinovskiy will arrive in Finland tomorrow together with a delegation from the Russian parliament. Correspondent Martti Hosia met him in Moscow. [Hosia] Absolutely not -- This was Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's reply when asked to give his view of Finland joining the European Union [EU] and in time, possibly NATO. He completely left aside EU membership, but was more than eager to seize on NATO. Keep away from NATO and all military alliances which are directed against Russia, otherwise you will turn into enemies of Russia and cannon fodder. German and Russian tank divisions will be fighting on your territory, Zhirinovskiy depicted the scene in his customary style. His party's deputy chairman, Ahmed Khalitov, for his part, complained that there is a lot of anti-Russian feeling in Finland at present. Weapons are being acquired and hostile propaganda is on the rise. The stick has two ends, Khalitov warned. Zhirinovskiy and his Liberal Democrat party comrades are known for their tough talking. Zhirinovskiy is an opposition leader and he does not need to be diplomatic in his choice of words. However, Zhirinovskiy does have close links with conservative officers in the army; the words have the same tone. NATO is still a red rag to the conservative officers here. For instance, a retired general who addressed a meeting of Slav nations in Moscow today, organized by Zhirinovskiy, was seriously of the view that the West's and NATO's peacekeeping activities in former Yugoslavia are only a dress rehearsal for an occupation of Russia. Against this background, it is understandable that NATO's Partnership for Peace project has also aroused severe condemnation here. Moscow does not like the fact that NATO first approached the East European and Baltic countries as well as Sweden and Finland. Russia was left last. In Moscow's view, the marching order should have been precisely the opposite. In Russia's official foreign political leadership, NATO's Partnership for Peace has caused chaos. In the opinion of President Yeltsin's spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov, it may take more than six months to reach agreement on Partnership for Peace, while Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev is talking about one month. As leader of the opposition, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is happy to spit into this NATO soup boiling in Moscow by warning Finland of the dangers of NATO and western leanings in general.
