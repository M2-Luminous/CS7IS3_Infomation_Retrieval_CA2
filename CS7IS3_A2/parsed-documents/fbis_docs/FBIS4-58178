FBIS4-58178 "drnes084yy_94008" FBIS-NES-94-084 Daily Report 1 May 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Arab-Israeli Talks Timetable for Prisoner Release Detailed Timetable for Prisoner Release Detailed TA0105080194 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 0600 GMT 1 May 94 TA0105080194 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Hebrew BFN [Text] Immediately after the signing of the agreement in Cairo on Wednesday, the release of the first half of the 5,000 Palestinian prisoners slated to be released will commence. The release process will continue until the beginning of the week following the signing of the agreement. Twelve hours after the agreement is signed, the Palestinian police force will start moving from Egyptian Rafah into the Gaza Strip via the Rafah border terminal. Palestinian sources told our correspondent Moti Amir that the convoy will include jeeps, light armored cars, and approximately 1,500 policemen under Raji Jabali, commander of the Gaza Strip police. They will be accompanied by Muhammad Dahlan, head of the Gaza Strip security services, who is considered to be the strong man in the Gaza Strip. Approximately 500 policemen will arrive in Jericho, but it is still unclear whether they will enter from Gaza, via the open passage agreed upon by the two sides, or from Jordan, via the Allenby Bridge. The policemen will be accompanied by administrative workers from the PLO headquarters in Tunis, and Jibril al-Rajub, head of the Palestinian security services in the West Bank. Yasir 'Arafat will apparently arrive in the territories on 15 June, after preparations in the field and the organization of the Palestinian institutions in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. He will be received in a large ceremony attended by ambassadors and possibly heads of state.
