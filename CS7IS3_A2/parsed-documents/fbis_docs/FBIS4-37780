This initiative is backed by many of the Labor's dovish members of the Kefar Hayaroq and Mashov circles, who last Thursday set up a joint front to promote the it. MK Burg said that this week he will present the Knesset with an offer to amend the law. The amendment states that the implementation of the law will be postponed until after all the basic laws have been incorporated into a state constitution. In the congregation last Thursday, MK Burg called for a "democratic jihad" against the direct election law. He warned against "a severe harm to Israel's democratic regime and civil rights if the law is implemented before all the basic laws -- designed to secure the civil rights of Israel's citizens -- are passed." Also, MK Elul intends to propose that one-third of the Knesset members be elected through regional elections for individual candidates. Most of those supporting the Burg-Elul initiative belong to the "Peres camp" in Labor. It is therefore believed that Peres is behind the initiative. Party members have also expressed fear that Rabin might view this initiative as a plot to unseat him and reignite the confrontation between him and Peres. Some of Rabin's associates maintain that Peres "is behind the revolt by Labor secretaries of local labor councils," aimed at weakening Rabin. At the same time, Peres' associates are accusing Rabin of "selling his soul to Ramon, and not minding to sell the party to Ramon as well." [In the same issue of HA'ARETZ, pages A1 and A10, a 800-word report by Yerah Tal and Gid'on Alon on the negotiations for the establishment of the Histadrut labor federation coalition adds that "Labor sources have said that Rabin's functioning as party chairman is one of the reasons for the expanding crisis in the negotiations between Labor and Ram, Hayim Ramon's list." "Senior Labor members of the negotiating team charged that Rabin is to blame for legitimizing moves by Ramon's men to set up a coalition with Likud members in the Histadrut and in local labor councils." The report adds that "the gloomy mood in Labor is also the result of the difficulties in expanding the government coalition in the wake of the deadlocked negotiations with SHAS, the Torah Observing Sephardim."] Tension between Rabin and Peres has been rising recently in view of this situation. A senior Labor source said over the weekend that Peres was offended when Rabin rejected his request to head the negotiating team with Syria for several months in order to bring about a breakthrough on this track. "Peres is frustrated these days. The agreement with Jordan is, in fact, completed; the process with the Palestinians is rolling; and the Syrian track is sealed off to Peres. Hence his bitter feeling toward Rabin," the Labor source said. He added that he expects the open conflict between the two to resume soon. [passage omitted] Another idea raised recently is an offer by MK Dalya Itzik to amend the party constitution so that a Labor prime minister could not also serve as party chairman, and for the two roles to be absolutely separate. MK Itzik believes that the amendment will not be applicable in the next Knesset elections. Therefore she intends to appeal to Rabin and the party institutions to appoint an emergency leadership for the party. This leadership will have to mend the rifts in the party and prepare it for the 1996 elections. MK Itzik suggests that Rabin delegate some of his authority as party chairman to three senior party members who will run party affairs with him until the elections, and attempt to rehabilitate it. The evident candidate for the role of party chairman is Shim'on Peres, but Itzik avoids suggesting this for fear of being charged of having considerations associated with party camps. This is the reason she is suggesting that Rabin delegate authority to three people, not just one. This is also called for in view of the expected difficulties in electing one person acceptable to all. [passage omitted] The crisis in Labor yielded yet another debate regarding internal elections. Many party members are demanding that the primary system be abrogated, viewing it as the root of all that is evil in the party. MK Gedalya Gal opposes the system, claiming that "it leads to the phenomenon of rebellion we are witnessing in the party today." MK's Burg and Hagay Merom, on the other hand, suggest that the party hold open primaries. [passage omitted]
