FR940224-2-00122 FR940224-2-00078 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Forms Under Review by Office of Management and Budget Agency Clearance Officer: John J. Lane (202) 942&hyph;8800 Upon Written Request, Copy Available From: Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of Filings, Information, and Consumer Services, Washington, DC 20549. Revisions Regulation 14A_File No. 270&hyph;56 Rule 20a&hyph;1_File No. 270&hyph;132 Rule 20a&hyph;2_File No. 270&hyph;133 Rule 20a&hyph;3_File No. 270&hyph;134 Regulation S&hyph;K_File No. 270&hyph;2 Form N&hyph;14_File No. 270&hyph;297 Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ), the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') has submitted for OMB approval amendments to Regulation 14A and Regulation S&hyph;K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 20a&hyph;1 through 20a&hyph;3 and Form N&hyph;14 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (``1940 Act''). Regulation 14A, and Schedule 14A thereto, sets forth general requirements for the solicitation of proxies. Approximately 8,000 respondents, other than management investment companies registered under the 1940 Act, prepare proxies with an estimated compliance time of 89 hours per registrant. Regulation 14A and Schedule 14A, currently and as proposed to be amended, have provisions applicable to investment companies. However, the burden hours for proxy filings by investment companies are imposed under Rules 20a&hyph;1 through 20a&hyph;3 discussed below and the Commission does not anticipate any changes to the burden imposed under Regulation 14A or Schedule 14A. Regulation S&hyph;K includes generally applicable disclosure items for registration statement forms, proxies, and other documents filed under the federal securities laws, and has an estimated compliance burden of one hour for administrative convenience because it does not directly impose filing requirements. The Commission does not anticipate that the propose amendments will change the burden associated with Regulation S&hyph;K. Rules 20a&hyph;1 through 20a&hyph;3 set forth various specific requirements applicable to the solicitation of proxies by investment companies. About 970 investment companies prepare proxies with an estimated compliance time of 97.2 hours per registrant. The Commission expects the amendments to decrease the burden by one hour, for a total compliance time of 96.2 hours. N&hyph;14 is the registration statement for use by investment companies to register securities under the Securities Act of 1933 issued in mergers and other forms of business combination. Approximately 95 registrants filed Form N&hyph;14 in 1992, with an estimated compliance time of 2,500.3 hours per registrant. The maximum additional burden imposed by the amendments is estimated to be one hour, for a total of 2,502.3 hours. General comments regarding the estimated burden hours should be directed to Gary Waxman at the address below. Any comments concerning the accuracy of the estimated average burden hours for compliance with Commission rules and forms should be directed to John J. Lane, Associate Executive Director, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549 and Gary Waxman, Clearance Officer, Office of Management and Budget, (paperwork Reduction Act Numbers 3235&hyph;0059, 3235&hyph;0158, 3235&hyph;0071, and 3235&hyph;0336), room 3208, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503.
