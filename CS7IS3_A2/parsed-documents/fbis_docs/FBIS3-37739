According to the instruction, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Machine-Building and the Ministry of Energy have been recommended to draw up by 1000 on 22 February a list of enterprises that will have gas consumption restricted or cut. UkrBudMaterialy [Ukrainian construction and materials committee] and UkrTsement [Ukrainian Cement] have been instructed to immediately prepare for production to be suspended. The instruction has also been sent to heads of oblast state administrations. As a UNIAN correspondent was informed on 22 February by UkrGazProm [Ukrainian gas industry committee], as of today the State Oil and Gas Committee's instruction had been carried out only by Ukraine's Ministry of Energy. In the opinion of a UkrGazProm representative, who wished to remain anonymous, unless the situation changed there would only be enough gas for 2-3 days. If there is frost, there would be restrictions for domestic consumers as well as for industrial enterprises. The UNIAN correspondent was told that the situation was also being made more complicated because along with Turkmenistan, Russia had also suspended gas deliveries to Ukraine along the Yelets Dykanka gas pipeline. UkrGazProm also said that if the gas situation in Ukraine became more complicated, one would have to illegally take Russian gas, which is transported to countries of Western Europe through Ukraine. The amounts have not yet been determined but in the opinion of an UkrGazProm representative they would be between 20-25 million cubic meters daily.
