He told journalists this today. One should not speak about a "new cabinet", Vladimir Shumeyko believes. "It's the same government, only minus Gaydar, Fedorov, and Shumeyko", he said. As a result of the reshuffle, the government "has become more compact and has started to address more the tasks facing the executive," and "presidential power has become more solid," Shumeyko is convinced. He categorically denies that the new composition of the cabinet is the outcome of a difficult compromise between the government, which favours a continuation of the radical reforms, and the premier, who is insisting on a correction of the course. "All the radical reforms have been set out in the government's plan of action for 1993-1995. It was adopted jointly with the president and all the corrections of the course were fully agreed with him". An extended session of the government will take place in February, which will be attended by the president and the heads of administration, of executive power, and the components of the Federation, which will sum up the results of 1993 and discuss tasks for this year. Some kind of correction of the course is inevitable at this session, Shumeyko said. But "no one intends to tamper with the reforms based on the removal from or arrival of anyone into the government." The speaker of the upper chamber believes the government's first task at the present stage to be measures to support the country's producers. "The commodity market is 75 percent full, and one must talk about developing our industry and our agriculture, and it is here where the main corrections of the cabinet's moves must be". Regarding the work of parliament, Vladimir Shumeyko noted that at the moment there was nothing to indicate that there would not be any cooperation between the two chambers or that the work of the State Duma would not be constructive. He reaffirmed that the Federation Council, according to the Constitution, has legislative initiative and may in extreme cases adopt laws independently. "Nevertheless, we must avoid such extremes", he added. The speaker said that one of the main issues facing the parliamentarians was the adoption of the Russian state budget for 1994. Next Monday the session of the Federation Council plans to discuss the question of the Russian socio-economic situation and Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin will present a report. "Such preliminary counsel with the members of the Federation Council will, I believe, influence the type of budget which the government will present to the Duma, and we will be able to adopt it much quicker".
