The entry for Swiss Bank Corporation is revised to read as follows: Swiss Bank Corporation, Basel, Switzerland (Applicant), has applied pursuant to section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) (BHC Act) and section 225.23 of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23), through its wholly owned subsidiary, SBC Government Securities, Inc., New York, New York (Company), to acquire substantially all the assets and certain of the liabilities of O'Connor & Associates, Chicago, Illinois (OCA), and to engage in the following nonbanking activities: 1 1 Applicant's proposal involves, inter alia , the consolidation into Company of certain activities currently conducted by OCA and two of Applicant's wholly owned subsidiaries, SBC Derivatives, Inc., Chicago, Illinois (SBC Derivatives), and SBCI Swiss Bank Corporation Investment Banking Inc., New York, New York (SBCI). In connection with, and substantially contemporaneously with, this transaction, OCA proposes to acquire certain assets and liabilities of K K & Company, New York, New York (KK).

Providing financial and transaction advice regarding the structuring and arranging of swaps and similar transactions (including swap derivative products) relating to commodity prices and commodity price indexes. Applicant seeks approval to conduct the proposed activities throughout the United States, and plans to conduct the activities on a worldwide basis. Closely Related to Banking Standard Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity ``which the Board after due notice and opportunity for hearing has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.'' In determining whether a proposed activity is closely related to banking for purposes of the BHC Act, the Board considers, inter alia , the matters set forth in National Courier Association v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System , 516 F.2d 1229 (D.C. Cir. 1975). These considerations are (1) Whether banks generally have in fact provided the proposed services; (2) Whether banks generally provide services that are operationally or functionally so similar to the proposed services as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed services; and (3) Whether banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed services as to require their provision in a specialized form. See 516 F.2d at 1237. In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that the activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. Board Statement Regarding Regulation Y , 49 FR 806 (1984). With respect to the proposal for Company to provide financial and transaction advice regarding the structuring and arranging of swaps and similar transactions (including swap derivative products) relating to commodity prices and commodity price indexes, Applicant maintains that the provision of such advice is functionally equivalent to the provision of advice with respect to swaps and similar transactions based upon interest rates, currency exchange rates, and economic and financial indices, an activity which the Board has determined to be closely related to banking. See 12 CFR 225.25(b)(4)(vi)(A)(2). Proper Incident to Banking Standard In order to approve the proposal, the Board must determine that the proposed activities to be conducted by Company ``can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' 12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8). Applicant believes that the proposal will produce public benefits that outweigh any potential adverse effects. In particular, Applicant maintains that the proposal will enhance competition and enable Company to offer its customers a broader range of products. In addition, Applicant states that the proposed activities will not result in adverse effects such as an undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices. In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice of the proposal is published solely in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application, and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets or is likely to meet the standards of the BHC Act. Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551, not later than June 10, 1994. Any request for a hearing on this application must, as required by 262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)), be accompanied by a statement of the reasons why a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal. This application may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, May 20, 1994. William W.
