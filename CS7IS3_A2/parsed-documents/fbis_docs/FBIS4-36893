The sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that there is great support for the Saudi proposal to cancel the meeting. They pointed out that this issue is at the top of the agenda of the OPEC ministers' meetings in Vienna this week. That is, in addition to compliance with output quotas and the election of a new secretary general. An OPEC source told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: "The talks are being held this time in favorable conditions, as oil prices have increased by more than 25 percent since the organization's last meeting in March, and they are expected to improve further in the coming months." The source added that "the continued gradual improvement in oil prices since OPEC's last meeting in Geneva last March confirms the success of the organization's strategy to defend its market quota." The organization's sources expect oil prices to increase by another $3 between now and the end of the year, provided member states adhere to their quotas. An official from one of the delegations said that "production excesses were the main cause of the organization's loss of a lot of its credibility in the market. And even though production excesses in recent months have been relatively limited, they have limited the chances of a bigger improvement in oil prices."
