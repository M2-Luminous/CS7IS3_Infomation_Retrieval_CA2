On a television program, Angel Lockward, spokesman of Balaguer's Social Christian Reformist Party (PRSC), criticized Chilean Luis Ayala, president of the SI, who last night described the irregularities observed in the general elections as "grave and serious." Lockward criticized the lack of respect shown by "some foreigners" and said that "none of them have the right to meddle in local politics." The PRSC indicated that the SI observers were invited by the social democratic Dominican Revolutionary Party of Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, the main opposition candidate. He added that the observers his party invited have remained respectful, without making statements.
