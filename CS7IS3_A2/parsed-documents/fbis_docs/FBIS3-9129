Antic: "Rugova Fights Back"] [Text] Pristina -- Recently, both the ethnic Albanian press and some circles of the ethnic Albanian political alternative in Kosovo have issued many controversial reports and commentaries that openly call in question the results and effects of the political and diplomatic efforts made so far by Ibrahim Rugova, leader of the ethnic Albanian separatist movement for the republic of Kosovo (or rather by his propaganda team). Of course, most of those reports and commentaries were published in the Serbian press as well. Yesterday the Kosovo Information Center issued a commentary in an unusual way, sending to Rugova's critics the message that they are on the wrong track because the international positions of Kosovo and of Rugova have definitely been improving. The Kosovo Information Center, whose commentary was published by BULJKU yesterday, alleges that the Belgrade regime accuses Rugova of pursuing a radical policy and extremism, aimed at the strengthening of his personal position abroad, while by such attacks, Rugova's critics from the ethnic Albanian political circles want to weaken his position at home and abroad, which he earned through his endeavors to settle the ethnic Albanian national question. The commentary, addressing in the first place the ethnic Albanian critics of Rugova and the results of his policies, reminds those same critics that they are focusing on the wrong problems, because, instead of concentrating on the Serbian terror and oppression on ethnic Albanians, which threatens to result in the arrest of Rugova himself, they are accusing Rugova that his policy is futile, and his resistance too passive. "Those same critics," the commentary runs further, "do not forbear to scandalously dramatize and extensively report on some cases of misunderstanding among several ethnic Albanian political groups in Kosovo and Macedonia, while hardly paying attention to the arrest of the entire staff of the Defense Ministry of the so-called republic of Kosovo. Some ethnic Albanian media and certain individuals have openly expressed their satisfaction at disagreements between Pristina and Tirana." Since the entire commentary suggests that there are serious breaches on the ethnic Albanian political stage in Kosovo, it sends the message to the "heretics" to come to their senses and concentrate on the Serbian occupation of Kosovo, rather than on Rugova, who works for the ethnic Albanian national cause in the best possible way. After this message the commentary specifies the political efforts that Rugova has made this year, as well as the effects and tributes paid to his policy abroad. Among other things the commentary also says that after Rugova's tour in the European Union member-countries late last year, Kosovo and Rugova's peaceful policy have been continuously winning recognition and support also this year as well. Then the commentary recalls Rugova's January visit to the United States, where President Clinton and State Secretary Warren Christopher expressed full support to Rugova, promising also that the United States will not tolerate the aggressive Serbian policy on Kosovo. The next example is Rugova's February visit to the United States, where Clinton and Al Gore expressed their understanding for Rugova's peaceful policy, which aims at finding a peaceful settlement to the situation in Kosovo. The commentary further says that last week the question of Kosovo was discussed by many international institutions, for instance, at the meeting of the highest CSCE officials in Prague, where the resolution was adopted by which it is demanded that the CSCE mission be returned to Kosovo. The commentary also points out the resolution adopted by the UN Commission for Human Rights, which refers only to Kosovo, and also the resolution on former Yugoslavia, which anticipates the self-determination of Kosovo. It is also emphasized that the Kosovo issue was discussed at the latest meeting of the EU Council of Ministers, as well as at many other international forums, where some concrete solutions for Kosovo have been proposed.
