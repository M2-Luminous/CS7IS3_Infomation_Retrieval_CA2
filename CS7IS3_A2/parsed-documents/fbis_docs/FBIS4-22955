Yelamanov, Aktyubinsk Oblast Public Health and Epidemiological Station; UDC 614:621.31] [Text]Abstract: A department of informatics and ASU was established at the Aktyubinsk Oblast Public Health and Epidemiological Station, while automated control system (ASU) groups were formed at the rayon level. Information was transmitted from the rayons to the oblast ASU, where the data were fed into a computer. This freed specialists of the oblast public health and epidemiological station from having to fill out report forms and other documents. The experience of working with computers showed that epidemic control measures are now being implemented more efficiently and promptly in the public health system. Key Words: public health and epidemiological station, computer, automated control system, preventive work. Computerization of public health and epidemiological institutions, which is gaining momentum, should culminate in creation of a sector-wide automated system for managing the public health and epidemiological service of the Kazakh Republic. The Sanepid OASU [Sector Automated Control System of the Kazakh Republic Public Health and Epidemiological Service] is a man-machine information and advisory system in which man functions as the controlling and decision-making unit, and which is intended for dynamic observation, evaluation and prediction of correlations in a complex social triad: production--environment--public health. The goal of the ASU is prompt and high quality accounting, analysis, evaluation and prediction of the health of the population and of the state of the environment, and their interaction. Under the OASU presently in operation, activities of administrative bodies such as collecting, monitoring and storing data, analyzing them from numerous aspects, subjecting results to expert examination and issuing hygienic conclusions are automated. These bodies also retain the functions of evaluating the presented results and making administrative decisions. All of this requires the strictest possible fulfillment of certain requirements. First of all the same package of programs must be used throughout, so that the information could be processes throughout the republic as a whole, and feedback could be provided. A department of informatics and ASU was established under the oblast public health and epidemiological station in early 1992 and ASU groups, each consisting of three persons and supported by public funding, were formed at the city and rayon levels in order to service the computers and process the data. The data transmission procedure was simplified: Data are now transmitted by telephone from local public health and epidemiological stations and then fed into the computer. This frees specialists of the oblast public health and epidemiological station from having to fill out report forms, and the information is transmitted to the Ministry of Health by modem. In the past it was sent by mail or by courier. Use of 12 computer programs makes it possible to efficiently control the public health and epidemiological situation in the oblast. Thus, after the data are processed, a specialist may request, at any time and in the necessary quantity, outputted documents representing report form No. 1 (infectious morbidity) taking the form of 24 statistical tables, and form No. 5 (preventive immunizations) with 12 statistical tables. Analytical tables on individual infectious diseases in the reporting period of the current year (in absolute numbers and as indicators per 100,000 population) are furnished to specialists on demand. The growth or decline of morbidity on a cross section of the oblast's administrative territories is calculated in these tables. The user sets a fixed data monitoring period--a week, a month, a quarter or a year. At the sector level we selected a week. The processed information consists of values of monitored indicators referenced to particular objects of analysis (water, food products, air, the population etc.) and objects of inspection (monitored institutions and territorial facilities) at which the corresponding bacteriological, public health and chemical analyses were made. The monitored indicators include unsatisfactory results of bacteriological analyses (for example, isolation of pathogenic and conditionally pathogenic microorganisms, detection of various sorts of deviations of the overall content of microorganisms from the standards, and so on), as well as so-called ``risk factors'' (information on physicochemical pollution, violations of production conditions, accidents etc.). The ``Public Health and Epidemiological Evaluation of Industrial and Drinking Water Supply'' program provides an objective evaluation of the potential epidemiological danger presented by water pipelines on a regular basis (once a month), while the ``Public Health and Epidemiological Evaluation of Oblast Dairies'' program gives evidence of the probability of production of infected products. Creation of a single set of software for the republic's entire public health and epidemiological service creates the possibility, depending on the way in which this software is used, to make the necessary changes and additions in the course of operation, with regard for, as an example, the specific needs of the user, the particular statistical report forms, and so on. The issue of computerizing the republic's public health and epidemiological service at the oblast level has now been resolved, which has resulted in the creation of a unified network and a sector-wide data bank. In our oblast, besides the oblast computers there are also computers in the city and the Martukskiy public health and epidemiological stations. In the future, as funds are appropriated, we intend to furnish each rayon public health and epidemiological station with a minimum of one IBM PC/AT personal computer, which will make it possible to fundamentally change the system for collecting, transmitting and analyzing information, and to upgrade the quality and efficiency of its processing. Efforts to organize and operate data bases and software in the first generation of the Sanepid OASU have now entered their final stage in the oblast. We have created a data base supporting background public health indicators, infectious morbidity indicators, the accounting and use of bacterial preparations, and other programs at the rayon level. This is making it possible to manage the public health and epidemiological situation better, and to develop packages of public health and epidemic control measures with adequate lead time.
