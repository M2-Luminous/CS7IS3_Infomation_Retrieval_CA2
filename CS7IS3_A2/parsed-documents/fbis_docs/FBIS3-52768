Mr. Abdur Rahim Mandokhel, who was the first speaker today, proposed reforms in the Constitution to give it true federal, parliamentary, and democratic orientation. He said the affairs of the government should be conducted through mutual accommodation and understanding between the government and the opposition on the one hand, and the center and the provinces on the other. The debate is still continuing. Responding to a point of order, the minister for law and parliamentary affairs, Syed Iqbal Haider, reiterated the government's determination not to indulge in any sort of victimization of its political opponents. The point of order was raised by Ejazul Islam Jatoi in the Senate this morning, who complained that political opponents were being victimized in Sindh. Syed Iqbal Haider, however, made it clear that the law will take its own course against criminals, terrorists, and plunderers of the people's money.
