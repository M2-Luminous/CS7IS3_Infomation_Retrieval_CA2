The resolution evoked controversy within the TEC as government and National Party representatives rejected it. Government representative Fanie van der Merwe and the NP's Leon Wessels argued the TEC had recommended its finance sub-council investigate the increases and report to the TEC next week. Any TEC decision on the increases should be made only after the sub-council had delivered its report, they argued. The increases were reported in a Sunday newspaper which speculated their effect would be to dramatically boost civil servants' pensions for retirees after the April elections. Mr Van Der Merwe said the TEC had no way of knowing who exactly would be affected by its decision. The resolution was carried with government and NP disagreement.
