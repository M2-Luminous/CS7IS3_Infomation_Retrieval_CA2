FR940630-2-00055 FR940630-2-00040 Special Instructions For Completing FCC forms 159 & 159&hyph;C FCC Form 159 (``FCC Remittance Advice'') and, as necessary, FCC Form 159&hyph;C (``Advice Continuation Sheet'') must accompany all regulatory fee payments. Form 159 allows payors to report information on one or two payment items ( e.g., satellites, LEO systems, antennas, or a combination of any two). Use Form 159&hyph;C to report additional payments. An FCC Form 159 and a 159&hyph;C have been attached to this Public Notice for you to complete and remit with your payment. You may make additional copies of the forms as required. In addition to the instructions for Form 159 (which are on the reverse side of the Form), the following information applies specifically to space and earth stations: Block (12)_``FCC Call Sign/Other ID'' •Geostationary space station licensees should leave this block blank. •Low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite system licensees should enter the name of their system. •Earth station licensees should enter their call sign. Block (14)_``Payment Type Codes'' SPACE STATIONS CSGN: Use this code when making full payment ( i.e., $65,200) for a geostationary satellite space station regulatory fee. CSG1: Use this code when making your first installment payment ( i.e. , $32,500) for a geostationary satellite space station regulatory fee. CSG2: To be used ONLY for the second installment payment ( i.e., $32,500) for geostationary satellite space station regulatory fee. CSLN: Use this code when making full payment ( i.e., $90,000) for a low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite system regulatory fee. CSL1: Use this code when making your first installment payment ( i.e. , $45,000) for a LEO satellite system regulatory fee. CSL2: To be used ONLY for the second installment payment ( i.e., $45,000) for a LEO satellite system fee. EARTH STATIONS CAVN: Use this code when making a regulatory fee payment for a VSAT or equivalent C-band earth station ($0.06 per antenna per call sign). CARN: Use this code when making a regulatory fee payment for a mobile satellite earth station ($0.06 per antenna per call sign). CAAN: Use this code when making a regulatory fee payment for fixed-satellite earth station antennas less than 9 meters in diameter ($0.06 per antenna per call sign). CSTN: Use this code when making a regulatory fee payment for fixed-satellite transmit/receive or transmit only earth station antennas greater than 9 meters in diameter ($85 per meter). CCRN: Use this code when making a regulatory fee payment for fixed-satellite receive only earth station antennas greater than 9 meters in diameter ($55 per meter). Block (15)_``Quality'' •Space station licensees ( i.e., geostationary satellites or low-earth orbiting satellite systems) should enter ``1'' in this block. •Fixed-satellite earth station licensees with antennas 9 meters or greater in diameter should enter the size of the antenna's diameter to the nearest tenth of a meter. •All other earth licensees (e.g., VSATs, mobile satellites and fixed-satellite antennas less than 9 meters in diameter) should enter the number of authorized antennas per call sign.
