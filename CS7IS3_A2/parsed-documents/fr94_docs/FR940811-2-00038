FR940811-2-00038 FR940811-2-00030 Due to the interstate nature of the New York-New Jersey Harbor and the desirability of consistency and equity among dischargers, the State of New Jersey requested that EPA promulgate TMDLs for the New York-New Jersey Harbor. EPA will, therefore, establish TMDLs as a federal action. Except for the Kill Van Kull and Arthur Kill, New York State has already implemented the necessary water quality-based effluent limits for waterbodies within the Harbor by issuing individual control strategies in the form of modified permits. EPA is establishing TMDLs for the remaining waterbodies for which New York State has not established TMDLs as well as Harbor waterbodies in the State of New Jersey. The EPA promulgation will result in the incorporation of TMDLs into State Water Quality Management Plans. In the State of New Jersey, this promulgation will amend the Northeast, the Lower Raritan/ Middlesex County and the Monmouth County Water Quality Management Plans. In New York State, this promulgation will amend the New York State Water Quality Management Plan. II. Tentative Determination A. Description of TMDLs The EPA is hereby issuing public notice of its intent to establish Phased TMDLs for copper, mercury, nickel and lead in New York-New Jersey Harbor. Based on ambient monitoring and/or water quality modeling efforts in New York-New Jersey Harbor, certain waterbodies within the Harbor exceed or are projected to exceed applicable water quality standards. In such cases, the Clean Water Act requires that the States calculate the maximum amount of the pollutant that the waterbody can assimilate and still meet ambient water quality standards. This amount, called the total maximum daily load, is then used to allocate loads among sources of pollutants. Loads allocated to point sources (e.g., municipal dischargers) are termed Waste Load Allocations (WLAs). Loads allocated to nonpoint sources (e.g., atmospheric inputs) are termed Load Allocations (LAs). Waterbodies within the Harbor which are known or projected to exceed applicable water quality standards and have been determined to require TMDLs are denoted by an ``X'' in Table 1. Certain waterbodies in the Harbor do not require TMDLs for all the metals of concern. For these waterbodies, no further action is being proposed. Table 1._ Waterbodies Needing TMDLs 1Waterbody 1Copper 1Mercury 1Nickel 1Lead Hudson River X Inner Harbor X Outer Harbor X Arthur Kill/Kill Van Kull X X X X East R./Harlem R. X Jamaica Bay X Raritan River/Bay X X X X Hackensack R./Passaic R./Newark Bay X X X X The proposed TMDLs for copper, mercury, nickel and lead use a phased TMDL approach. For copper, nickel, and lead, the waterbodies listed in Table 1 exceed applicable water quality standards based on concentrations projected to occur by the water quality model employed for this TMDL effort. Due to the limited ambient and loading data, the state of the model calibration is uncertain for the Raritan River/Bay, the Hackensack and Passaic Rivers, and Newark Bay. Based on the available ambient data, it has been determined that existing loads are adequate to meet applicable water quality standards. The Phase I TMDLs for these waters will be based on limiting municipal and industrial point source dischargers to existing loads. Additional data collection and modeling for the Hackensack River, Passaic River, Newark Bay, Kill Van Kull, Arthur Kill, and Raritan River/Bay will be required. Once sufficient data have been collected and the water quality model has been adequately calibrated, Phase II TMDLs will be developed, adopted and implemented, as necessary, by the States of New York and New Jersey with assistance from EPA. However, if significant interstate issues arise and the Commissioners of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection jointly request an EPA promulgation, EPA will promulgate Phase II TMDLs for the interstate waters of New York-New Jersey Harbor.
