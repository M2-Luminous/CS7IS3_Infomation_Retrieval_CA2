This was stated for SRNA by Momcilo Krajisnik, chairman of the people's assembly of the Serbian republic. I do not want to prejudice any solutions, but at this moment I do not see any way of satisfying Croatian-Muslim demands, Krajisnik said. The Serbs do not want anyone else's land. We are defending our ethnic regions in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, and following this principle, the Serbian side is prepared to give up part of the territory that is holding at present, even some land that it owns, which amounts to 64 percent, for the benefit of creating the compactness of the state, Krajisnik said. For the principle, the Serbs will give up parts of the territory, but only up to the percent that will not endanger the vital interests of the Serbian people. These interests are the definitive separation from the Croats and the Muslims and a compact state territory, which above all means a corridor through the Posavina region, the chairman of the Serbian republic assembly explained, adding that other strategic interests of the Serbian people, which cannot be given up at any cost, are the ethnic regions along the Una, Drina, and Neretva Rivers. The Serbian side has many objections to the Geneva declaration, but we are currently ignoring them for the benefit of the positive shifts, thus leaving room for ending hostilities and searching for a mutually agreed solution, Momcilo Krajisnik stressed in his interview with SRNA.
