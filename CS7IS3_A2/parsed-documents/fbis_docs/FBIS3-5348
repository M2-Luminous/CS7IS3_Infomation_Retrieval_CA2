As already exposed, the nuclear waste dumpted into the sea by the South Korean rulers in seven years from 1986 to 1992 amounts to 11,000 trillion becquerels. Noting that this act of the South Korean authorities is a never-to-be-condoned crime endangering the existence of the nation and destroying the ecological environments of the nature, a NODONG SINMUN analyst says: Their dumping of nuclear waste into the sea is an anti-national criminal act of turning the Korean peninsula and the seas around it into a nuclear-polluted waste region. And this is a gross violation of the international law and accord. The nuclear waste dumping by the South Korean puppets is unthinkable apart from their feverish nuclear arms development. Their nuclear armament which has been accelerated from the early 70's is now entering a very dangerous stage. The puppets have played the role of a shock brigade in the "nuclear" racket kicked up by the international reactionaries to isolate and stifle the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, charging it with its "nuclear issue." This is chiefly aimed at stepping up their criminal nuclear development behind the scene. With the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique left alone, it is impossible to prevent the devastation of the land and seas and protect the nation from a nuclear disaster, let alone independence, democracy and reunification. A MINJU CHOSON analyst warns that if the South Korean puppets push ahead with nuclear development, continuing nuclear waste dumping into the sea, they will face a stern judgement by the nation and mankind.
