The PFL [Liberal Front Party] has managed to convince Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso that revisions are in the best interest of the government. After lunching with Fernando Henrique last week, Marco Maciel (PE) [Pernambuco State] -- the PFL bloc leader in the Senate -- and Deputy Luis Eduardo Magalhaes (BA) [Bahia State] -- the PFL bloc leader in the Chamber of Deputies -- believe the government is the newest ally of the revisionists who are struggling for votes now. Maciel told JORNAL DO BRASIL yesterday afternoon: "We now have a very important partner, namely the government." During their lunch, the PFL leaders explained the importance of the revision for the government's economic program. Neither the fiscal adjustment nor the 1994 budget will be approved without constitutional changes that necessarily involve a reform. The senator claimed: "It is essential to begin the revision this week." He guaranteed: "The minister totally agrees with this point of view." [passage omitted]
