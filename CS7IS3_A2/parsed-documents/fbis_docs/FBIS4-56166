The state of Sao Paulo is the largest industrial, trade, and financial center of the Federal Republic of Brazil and forms almost half of its GDP. Klaus told reporters that the discussions focused on the possibility of the export of Czech transport equipment, specifically trams, buses, and trolley-buses. He said the Czech side would soon receive the conditions of a tender to be announced during the following months, which would concern the development of the transport system in one of the biggest towns in the world. Fleur called for the formation of joint ventures between Czech and Sao Paulo firms to make easier the realization of specific orders for equipment to develop and improve the town's transport system, which fails to meet the needs of the town's 16 million inhabitants.
