What can you say in this connection? [Babych] When I registered myself as a candidate for Ukraine's Supreme Council deputy, there were 17 persons altogether, who were put to the vote. I swore that I would not say a single bad word about any one of them and will not characterize their actions or conclusions. I have now made the same promise to God: I will not say a single bad word about a single presidential candidate. I believe that our people are sufficiently intelligent and wise. Thus, both rank-and-file people and professionals will sort out various approaches and truths. I do not want to impose my opinion upon anybody instead of giving a direct answer. As regards the question that was answered by Mr. Kuchma, I can say this: I never was a prostitute in business and I will never be a prostitute in politics. I believe that this characterizes my actions in business in full. Those people who worked with me know: I never betrayed anybody and never changed my views. I went into politics for one simple and clear reason: I am sick and tired of pleading and persuading others -- "Rescue the economy." I have realized: Unless we ourselves assume control over the state and create a legislative foundation at the highest level, we will have to wait a long time for alms, but there will be no economic stabilization. Today, I have emerged from the "trenches," and I am ready to place my experience, knowledge, and views of life at the scaffold of politics in order to achieve a considerable improvement of the situation in the economy. [Correspondent] Have you resigned as president of the investment company "The Ukrainian Financial Group" [UFG] in connection with your election as a Supreme Council deputy? [Babych] Yes, on 13 May I signed a document on giving up my powers in connection with becoming a Supreme Council deputy and my nomination as a Ukrainian presidential candidate. My functions have been passed on to the acting president. I can only be relieved of my duties by the meeting of shareholders. The meeting was appointed for July-August. I would like to say goodbye to the shareholders and thank them for the confidence that they gave me for three years. I have already practically abandoned all these affairs. It is physically impossible to combine the election campaign with running the UFG financial matters. That is why I have adopted this path. I have become fully immersed in politics. I am firmly convinced and will prove to others that today's politician must be an economist, financier, and market-oriented businessman, who has one goal: To enrich the state and the people. I believe that this is our time -- the time of the people who know how to do something real for the people. [Correspondent] Who is financing your election campaign? And how? [Babych] Within the framework of the Law on Elections. Quite a number of friends offer me funds and assist with technical means. As they say, I have not prostituted myself to any structure -- it is not in my nature. I went to elections with what I personally have and with the support of my friends. This question is emphasized because some people are lying in wait for me to take the first thousand dollars [as a bribe] in order to immediately trumpet it to the whole world and compromise me. [Correspondent] The week of the parliament's work gives rise to sad reflections. If you become president, is it possible to work with such a parliament and implement what you have planned? [Babych] You are not right. One should not be afraid of reaching compromise and must develop skills in finding a common language with different people. We must totally abandon methods of "coming to power" and for the sake of power, which ruthlessly suppresses particular groups of differently minded people. We must understand a simple thing: When people come to power and not to managing the state, the system will compel them to look up Communists, Rukh [Ukraine's People's Movement for Perestroyka] members, Greens or whites. I am convinced: This approach of the exclusive nature of one's own ideas and their exclusive correctness is pernicious for any nation or state. The programs of various parties or movements do not differ much. Their goal is the achievement of Ukraine's well-being. The question lies in something else: How to do that? Today, there are already people in Ukraine who know how to do that. [Correspondent] Can Pynzenyk or Pylypchuk [economists and political figures] head the Supreme Council Economic Commission for Economic Reform? [Babych] Reformers may head commissions. However, executive structures must be manned with professionals who know what to do and not by dilettantes who come with advice and collect advice on what needs to be done. For a long time, I worked in Derzhplan [State Planning Committee] and at the Council of Ministers and saw with my own eyes how much harm to the economy dilettantes may cause by their activity. I witnessed how two deputy chiefs, guided by purely ambitious motivations, refused to sign a joint document, even though, as a result, Ukraine lost hundreds of millions of dollars in old prices. It is already clear to many people that a team must assume executive control. Whether good or bad -- a team. A creative team and not a team of those who will pocket wealth. That is why I am in favor of a stringent system of a team assuming control. Regarding a legislative basis, I am quite comfortable in my attitude toward the assembly of people of different nationalities and political parties that have gathered at the Supreme Council. Yes, discussions must be held there, various issues must be disputed and resolved, and they must be implemented by a team. The main question, which was not answered by the preceding parliament and which must be resolved by the parliament of the present convocation, is what we are going to build. Inflation has driven the economy into such a situation that a question naturally arises: What methods will we employ in the management of the economy -- administrative state, that is to say socialist, or market-oriented ones? This question is presently the principal one. Unless we answer it, all our subsequent efforts will be in vain. The present mechanism is only advantageous for department bureaucrats. They successfully use what suits them best. For example, they get money through the state system and pay for communal and other services through the same system, but when it comes to dividing the capital earned by the enterprise, they suddenly recall that a market mechanism exists and that something must go to their own pockets. Therefore, either the administrative state system -- then it is necessary to introduce regulation, standard freezing of prices, subsidies, and so on -- nothing so terrible, in principle. Or, as I prefer, a different platform: I believe that, today, we should not return to what, as we have seen from our own experience, leads to an inefficient economy. We must proceed to a market economy. We must proceed, in our deeds, from the interests of the individual and his family. [Correspondent] There recently was a session of the presidium of the All-Ukrainian Association of Enterprises. What plans were adopted there? Did the Ukrainian entrepreneurs reach an agreement? [Babych] The All-Ukrainian Association of Enterprises practically unites all unions, with the exception of three -- the unions of cooperators, joint ventures, and small enterprises. It took us a long time to think about the expedience of holding the congress, because everybody is sick and tired of political battles and reasoning, such as "let us protect ourselves more." However, the majority of the members of the presidium agreed that it was, after all, worth getting together in order to feel the atmosphere of approaches and views prevailing in the nonstate sector. At present, the executive management elaborates the organizational aspect of the matter. It will complete its work in the near future, and we will announce the date for holding the congress. Everything will proceed in a businesslike atmosphere. We will exchange ideas on a number of problems, especially those that presently give rise to differences, for example, about the contractual form of ownership: Is it worth supporting it further or is it temporary? Small enterprises require serious analysis. We will also discuss specific commercial and finance proposals on international cooperation and will familiarize the delegates to the congress with proposals on credit lines that are presently being elaborated. [Correspondent] When [Mayor of St. Petersburg] Anatoliy Sobchak was a people's deputy of the USSR, he published a very interesting book with a quite symbolic title: "The Coming to Power." It may be firmly stated: You, Valeriy Heorhiyovych, are already in power. How do you understand power as a Ukrainian presidential candidate? [Babych] I understand the concept of power as such that needs to be taken away from the president and the Cabinet of Ministers. Power should not continue just to come. If [koly] I become president, I will try to see to it that more powers are transferred to lower structures, where they must exist in order to protect the interests of the people and of the individual. Today, leaders of farms, departments, and even ministers come to power and not to the management of an industry or of the country. Therefore, we must put an end to this "Coming to Power." The U.S. president does not come to power, but to the management of the state. In our country, superpower is concentrated in the hands of subjective individuals, who cannot always guarantee objective resolution of particular issues. No matter how hard they try, this will be a subjective approach. On the other hand, if a person comes to MANAGEMENT, the range of his influence upon resolving state and economic problems is narrowed, and he can influence and interfere in the national economic and, even more, in the state system by about 10-15 percent. There are restrictions that must be urgently applied to superpower. [Correspondent] There is presently much talk on strong executive power. What is your interpretation of this issue? [Babych] I believe that in working on a decision, it is always necessary to consult others and not just once. At the same time, a single person must manage the country's economy. Just imagine: Three plant directors have been appointed at one go. Will there be an effect? In this case, everybody realizes that there will be no result. However, why are we applying such a model to the whole state and hoping to achieve positive results? There will be none! There must be one tough team that will work for one goal -- tough, but not in terms of methods, but in subordination and mutual subordination. It must be headed by a single commander who bears the entire responsibility for the team and who is ready to be answerable before the people for everything. [Correspondent] What is your attitude toward the fact that the former leadership set the minimal fixed capital required for registering small enterprises at 37 million karbovantsi [K], having thereby placed a barrier to their joining the business sphere? Will not this affect the activity of big business, which you represent? [Babych] Small businesses must exist. This is why: They create a potential medium for, let us put it this way, the emergence of promising businessmen and entrepreneurs. In other words, it is a desirable medium, which must discover the talents and abilities of a certain circle of people who want to dedicate themselves to business, which is, incidentally, very difficult and not for everyone. Every person must decide for himself what he wants to be -- master, performer, owner, co-owner, or a simple state official. The state does not stimulate small businesses. The state does not stimulate anything. The fiscal system of taxes that is presently in use has practically led production and the sphere of services, not to mention small businesses, to an impasse. My position and my program in this respect are clear: The first thing that needs to be done today is to fully stimulate the production activity of any person who wants to work, whether in the state or nonstate sector. We are obliged to welcome those people and those persons who want to work and create good conditions for them. First of all, there must be a sensible taxation policy, including in the sphere of external economic activity. The Ministry of Finance, which continues to degrade, must finally realize that contributions to the budget must come from the circulating capital that circulates in commerce and in production. Turnover alone must contribute to the budget. At the same time, it is desirable to lower taxes imposed upon the population and upon production, and the state must stimulate what it needs. At present, in our country, when the question of Ukraine's survival is at stake, I would say, the policy of the stumbling-block approach prevails. Some people say: Russia has much oil -- let us also urgently look for oil in our country. Let us look for diamonds and gold. This must be immediately stopped, and we must abandon the principle of raw-material development. Today, the only salvation for the country's survival and for ensuring economic stability is in the technological breakthrough. The state must give urgent support to science, to the implementation of technologies, and to the efficient utilization of production capacities. I was, for example, surprised when I read that Leonid Makarovych [Kravchuk] agreed to introduce preferential taxation for builders. Those who are again going to put something down the drain, have again obtained preferential terms for taxation. This is not right. It is only science, technology, and the creation of scientific hi-tech production complexes, where science works for achieving the end result -- the output of absolutely essential technology, equipment, machinery, and consumer goods -- which have the right to preferential terms. Then we will emerge at the appropriate level. Otherwise, we will always remain an appendage to anyone -- Poland or Hungary. It is ridiculous: Hungary is presently supplying us with meat and so on. The tax constriction and the credits and finance system stifle the producer both in the state and nonstate sectors. Unless serious measures in the opposite direction are taken, the noose will choke the commodity producer and we end up with food rationing.... [Correspondent] How do you assess the course of market reforms in Ukraine? [Babych] We have found ourselves on the verge of ruining market reforms. The world community is watching us very attentively. Those people who sit in their offices do not, perhaps, imagine the lightning speed with which Western investment, banking, financial, and governmental circles respond to the events in Ukraine. After Mr. Moroz was elected chairman of the Supreme Council, foreign investments through the Ukrainian Financial Groups were immediately suspended. There was one question: Please give a distinct definition: Is he a Socialist or a Communist? Restoration of planned economy? Following the election of the two deputy Supreme Council chairmen, the reaction was similar. Therefore, those people who sit in governmental offices and in the parliament do not even realize that the adoption of any decision must conform to the interests of the state and world community. We have become too important and independent people. We have failed to realize one thing: There is no such thing as pure independence in this world. Everything is integrated, whether we want it or not, into mutual economic and financial relations. This must be distinctly understood by our young parliament, which is yet to learn the experience of statehood, since the first period in its work resembled the approach usually exhibited by teams on the block: Let us create teams on our block and start pulling the rope in order to determine which team is stronger. I believe, however, that in two or three months, people will realize that they did not come to the parliament in order to stand up for the interests of regions, departments, or factions, but for resolving nationwide problems. I hope that by the end of the year, if the people do not disband us by that time, real state work will start, and every faction and every deputy will realize that he is responsible for the state, and not for a party or industry; that he is responsible for the 52 million people living on this territory. [Correspondent] An idea is being considered of how to stabilize credits -- to grant them in a different form, via authorized banks. [Babych] Still, I consider the problem of elaborating a distinct and efficient mechanism for repaying credits to be a major one. Why do many of our structures not receive credits abroad? Because there is no mechanism for their repayment. Behind all of this, one can see maneuvers of the Cabinet of Ministers, which is trying to create a semblance of activity. There are borderlines for any Cabinet of Ministers and for any person, and they are incapable of overstepping them. I call it a barrier or a limit to human possibilities. In most cases, people themselves put them. In my life, I repeatedly broke that barrier. One needs to have vigor to overstep it. Our government is made up of generally good and normal people, but they have a limit to the possibilities of elaborating a decision. They must do one of two things: Either take one step forward and say that we must proceed along the road of the market and implement specific reforms or honestly give way to others, who are not afraid to do this very difficult job. It takes courage to make such a step. This applies to the parliament, president, and Cabinet of Ministers. Unless this is done, there will be an impasse zone, a dead zone. However, there is a hope that people capable of overstepping that borderline will come and they will know what is the main thing and what to do next. [Correspondent] As a candidate for Ukrainian president, are you in favor of Ukraine's territorial integrity or do you admit some variants? Do you see ways for resolving the Crimean problems? [Babych] My approach to this problem is unambiguous. Once, when Ukraine was disassociating itself from the USSR, we welcomed that event. We also believed that we were doing the right thing when the community of the people populating Ukraine voted for life in a separate state. They believed that it was correct. I believe that the process of the disintegration of Russia and possibly also of Ukraine has not been halted. With regard to the Crimea, I have the following approaches. I will say openly: I personally and a group of my specialists made proposals well in advance, proposals which anticipated the present development of events in the Crimea and we offered recommendations for what had to be done for the Crimea not to raise the question of seceding from Ukraine. In all cases, I put the economic factor above all. Politics is a greater economy and not the other way around. We are constantly being misled. Those old times when states were divided by wars, cudgels, and so on have passed. At present, states, markets, and territories are divided at the expense of economic decisions. Therefore, the Crimean problem should have been resolved earlier, one and a half or two years ago, through giving the Crimea economic incentives and tying it to Ukraine, so that it would have simply been disadvantageous for it to secede. This was not done. There were hopes that the new constitution and possible use of force would restrain the people, who might suddenly want to leave Ukraine. Consequently, if the majority of the population votes for the Crimea's secession from Ukraine, then, I am afraid, there may arise a situation in which the constitution and the will of the people residing in the Crimea will not conform to the mutual interests of not only Ukraine, but also of the world community. We will be confronted with the problem of the emergence of a new state on the territory of Europe. I would also like to stress: There is no need to stir up passions around this question. It is necessary to try and convince the Crimea, just like any partner or friend, that it would be economically unprofitable for it to sever ties with us, and to promote a transformation of mutual economic relations. Even now, it is still not too late to create such conditions of mutual understanding precisely on the economic platform, so that it would be worthwhile for the Crimea to remain within Ukraine and work together. In my opinion, any other approach will be fraught with negative phenomena to the point of a civil war. My position with regard to territorial integrity is straightforward: Ukraine is indivisible. However, I repeat: When the people have voiced their will, one needs to proceed from the position of what the people want. When 90 percent of Ukraine's population voted for the secession from Russia, should there have been a war with Russia? If Russia failed to keep us within the Union economically and to prove the expediency of such union, then let us also treat other peoples' will in the same way. We must learn to convince people and not to break them. [Correspondent] How serious is the outflow of capital from Ukraine to the Crimea? [Babych] Such a problem exists. During one of the meetings with head of the government Mr. Zvyahilskyy, I also asked: What measures have been taken in response to [Crimean President] Meshkov's economic edicts? I understood that the government, the Ministry of Finance, and the National Bank did not react to Meshkov's step in any way. Meshkov has a rather good team of professionals who have found an ideal method of knocking out from under Ukraine its economic and financial footstool, not even stool, but precisely the footstool, the last footstool being taken away from it. A thoroughly considered economic blow below the belt. A huge amount of capital flows away from Ukraine. It is time for our major leaders to realize that they must react in time to these or other actions. I can say that Meshkov has made a brilliant move, which is advantageous for him, but if we don't make a reciprocal move, no monetary mass at all will remain in Ukraine. What then? To take submachine guns and go and get what money is available? Such a development of events can be predicted, but I do not think that the National Bank has sufficient combat capabilities. Other methods and approaches are necessary here. [Correspondent] How do you see Ukraine's National Bank [NBU]? Is is worth placing the NBU at the mercy of the parliament? [Babych] I do not share the opinion of those who believe that the National Bank must be thrown to the mercy of the parliament or Cabinet of Ministers. The National Bank must be at the head of the state's financial system. It must receive a distinct set of regulations on mutual relations, in other words, a financial policy, from the legislative body -- the Supreme Council. All other problems must be resolved by it independently. It must have a priority in the economy -- a stabilization of the national currency. Everything else constitutes levers of the mechanism for implementing reforms in the economy. Therefore, any economic reform which intensifies the inflation process has no right to exist. We must consciously agree to a certain inflation process, but a specific one, through the National Bank. Enormous masses of coupons and capital have been frozen, but the people wait. Circulating capital is simply insufficient. It is consequently immediately necessary to stop financing those industries whose output is not in demand and goes to warehouses, and to help such enterprises to appraise the situation. Here, the main thing for the state is to stabilize its national currency. [Correspondent] President of the Russian "Economic News Agency" Sergey Turanov telephoned the Press Center and said that they learned with interest that a Ukrainian entrepreneur, well-known in Russia, has become a candidate for the Ukrainian presidency. On behalf of the agency, Sergey Turanov asked us to put the following question: "How do you see the future of mutual economic relations between Ukraine and Russia, especially today?" [Babych] Much has already been said about this. I very seldom change fundamental approaches, especially when I am convinced of their correctness. In 1991, prior to signing the state agreement between Russia and Ukraine, we signed, at our own initiative, an agreement between the entrepreneur circles of the two countries. There is also my signature under that document. At that time, I had to hear everything from our National Guard -- that I was selling Ukraine and so on. I never sold anything. I am not selling anything now. Even to global and nonglobal problems, my approach is only from the economic point of view. Any restriction of economic possibilities and slow circulation of capital are economically harmful. I am in favor of integrating maximum possible conditions for production, circulation of capital, finance, and so on. I can answer the question in the following way: I am against creating closed economic circles. There must be specialization and the division of labor on an international scale. All possible and impossible industries should not be concentrated on a single territory. [Correspondent] If you become president, how do you see the struggle against the mafia and corruption? [Babych] I will say clearly: It is necessary to combat this evil. However, we should not forget this: When we blame the Ministry of Internal Affairs and other bodies which must struggle against this phenomenon, we must remember that under the uniform and under the shoulder boards there is a human being who has a family and who needs a normal salary so that he will not look for additional sources of income. We must approach all these processes from the point of view of the economy. It is necessary for all our structures to have, in their everyday activity, the interests of the people at the foreground. It is only with methods of the economy that we can fight the corrupt mafia. [Correspondent] It is known that an edict on currency regulation is sitting on the president's desk. The Supreme Council has also prepared such a law. What is your point of view? [Babych] Currency regulation is what must be done. However, it is not a panacea for rescuing the economy. I think that practically nothing will change over the next two or three weeks. I read that project. It is ineffective and will not introduce any cardinal changes into currency regulation. I believe that, unless a new premier is elected within the next two or three weeks, a premier who would have freedom of action, nothing will change. All the more so since all the rayon and oblast leaderships have now practically given up management of the economy, are only interested in their own election affairs, and are occupied with elections of deputies, mayors, and governors. Therefore, a month of anarchy is guaranteed for Ukraine. However, I hope that this anarchy will end on 26 June. [Correspondent] If, in the stage of the presidential election campaign, President Kravchuk introduces the hryvnya, how will this affect Ukraine's economy? [Babych] I consider introduction of the hryvnya, without three main preconditions, to be a political adventure, irrespective of who initiates this action -- the president, parliament, or some other persons. This would be yet another case of deception of the people. I have become convinced: In our country the state is the worst thief -- it robs the population particularly badly. I can prove this on any examples -- not once did the state turn out the pockets of the population. Introduction of the hryvnya is only possible on three conditions. First, the creation of a stabilization fund and the unconditional arrest of the hyperinflation. Second, indexation of the funds held by the population, so that the people would be encouraged not to spend and not to get rid of the coupons mass. Third, a change in the financial and credit and taxation policy. It is only under such conditions that we will be able to resolve the question of introducing the hryvnya. I have long been insisting on introducing the hryvnya, because the hryvnya will resolve many problems. If we do this, we will eliminate the so-called panic buying. Today, nobody -- not a single person -- wants to keep coupons. If we stop this process we will see how the market will become saturated, not like today, when some leaders boast that a stabilization in the economy has occurred as well as a stabilization of the market, although it is a different matter: Meat stays on the shelves not because the market is saturated, but because the people have no money to buy it. I reiterate that introduction of the hryvnya without ensuring these conditions is a political adventure. [Correspondent] How do you see the future of atomic power engineering in Ukraine? [Babych] I am not a professional for making far-reaching forecasts. However, I am sure that we will not abandon atomic power engineering, even though the shadow of Chernobyl is hanging above us. I was a member of the Governmental Commission for Eliminating the Consequences of the Chernobyl Catastrophe. Let us hope, with God's help, that this will never happen again. I will be able to give a more detailed answer to this question after I study additional information on the problems of power engineering. [Correspondent] What is your attitude toward privatization in Ukraine? [Babych] It is negative toward that privatization, which is presently under way. We have not prepared economic or financial mechanisms for implementing privatization. At present, the state structures responsible for privatization have grown so corrupt that commercial structures, in their development, did not even dream of anything like that. Enterprises are handed over to unworthy persons. You know where the problem here lies? To distribute "bricks" among everybody is not a problem. It is more difficult to make those "bricks" provide profits. This is a very big problem. When we say that privatization is a gift for the people, we are once again deceiving the people. I am in favor of the joint-stock form of ownership. This form is more open and more accessible. It does not tie up every one of its owners to some "property." If a person obtains his part in the form of shares, he can sell them, exchange, or deposit. With our privatization we have again tied up the people to the "brick," and have not made them owners of anything real. For example, in Great Britain, over two years, 5 percent of state property was privatized. We for our part want to carry out privatization of 90 percent of property. This is not serious. We generally tend to run now to the left and now to the right. This is not the way to establish market relations. This is not a basis for establishing a market. This is not a basis for establishing private ownership, but yet another shady enterprise. In my opinion, the present privatization model must be revised. The process of privatization must be halted in order to prepare a normal financial and economic mechanism and only after that advance forward. [Correspondent] Valeriy Heorhiyovych, speak louder, so that you would be HEARD. At the parliament. [Babych] My voters in Western Donbass have heard me. I was a complete stranger when I came there and said: "My principle is to come to you as a stranger and leave as a friend." If the people believe that I am not a stranger, I will probably become a friend to them.
