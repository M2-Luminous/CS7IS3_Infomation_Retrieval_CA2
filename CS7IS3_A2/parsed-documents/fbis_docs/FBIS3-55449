Meri signed a decree on Saturday [8 January] replacing Foreign Minister Trivimi Velliste with Juri Luik who has thus far held defence minister's portfolio. Under the same decree, Meri awarded defence minister's job to Indrek Kannik. He also dismissed Finance Minister Madis Uurike, but turned down Laar's nominee for the position leaving the post vacant. Meri also rejected Laar's proposal to dismiss Economics Minister Toomas Sildmae. "Under the constitution of the Republic of Estonia, changes in the government lie within prime minister's jurisdiction while the president has no right to form the cabinet," the government's press office said. President's legal advisor Vahur Glase replied telling ETA that the government's statement had not been correct and that under paragraph 90 in the constitution, changes in the government were to be made by the president after a proposal by the premier. Premier's proposal is of advisory, not compulsory nature, Glase added. Laar also said in his statement he was prepared to take the matter to the legal chancellor and the constitutional court while ministers who had been appointed by Meri would not take office. Consequently, Estonia has no foreign, defence or finance minister. "This is a crisis on how to interpret the constitution and legislation and by no means a government crisis," government's spokesman Ain Saarna told ETA. Laar expressed his regret over the situation saying instability in Estonia's domestic policy was not acceptable in the present situation. Four nominated ministers -- Juri Luik, Toivo Jurgenson, Indrek Kannik and Heiki Kranich -- met Meri in his presidential palace Sunday evening. After the meeting, the situation remained unchanged. Luik and Kannik refused to take up their new positions and Meri refused to accept the package and appoint all four ministers. Jurgenson was Laar's choice for economics minister and Kranich was his nominee for finance minister's position. The current government reshuffle contains danger of crisis, but is not crisis, Environment Minister Andres Tarand said in his commentary to ETA while adding the situation was not dramatic. "At the moment, we have a replacement system which is being used during ministers' foreign trips," Tarand said.
