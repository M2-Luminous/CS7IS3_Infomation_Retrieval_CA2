FR940304-0-00092 FR940304-0-00019 The Act and 50 CFR 17.62, 17.63 and 17.72 also provide for the issuance of permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered or threatened plant species under certain circumstances. It is anticipated that few permits would ever be sought or issued. The taxa are not common in cultivation or in the wild, and only one taxon, Pritchardia affinis , is known to be in an active program of cultivation. Requests for copies of the regulations concerning listed plants and inquiries regarding prohibitions and permits may be addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services, Permits Branch, 911 NE 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232&hyph;4181 (503/231&hyph;6241; FAX 503/231&hyph;6243).

A notice outlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published in the Federal Register on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).
