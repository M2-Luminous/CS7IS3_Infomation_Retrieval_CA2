A group from Kanal-6 visited northern Iraq and met the Kurdish leaders of the problematic region. We are presenting our colleague Kursat Hakyolu's impressions from northern Iraq with the pictures taken by cameraman Numan Tunc Inal. [Begin recording] [Hakyolu] While the PKK [Kurdish Workers Party] terrorism escalated on the Turkish side of the Turkish-Iraqi border, the position taken by the Kurdish groups on the other side of the border against the PKK is somehow not becoming clearer. Steps taken by the northern Iraqi Kurds toward the formation of a state are being debated in international forums. In the meantime, Kurdish groups are feuding with each other. The clashes between the Kurdistan Islamic Front and Patriotic Union of Kurdistan led by Jalal Talabani have just ended. It is also being reported that there is disagreement between Jalal Talabani and Mas'ud Barzani, leader of Democratic Party of Kurdistan, on stances to be adopted toward the PKK. Our meeting with the north Iraqi Prime Minister Muhammad Rasul Kusret took place while these important developments were taking place in the region. Barzani had once again declared the PKK a terrorist organization, whereas Talabani made no statement. This was our first question to Prime Minister Kusret, who is from Talabani's PUK. [Kusret in Arabic with superimposed Turkish translation by an off-screen reporter] We reject every sort of violence, no matter where it comes from. If violence is coming from the PKK, we reject that too. We condemn all sorts of violence. [Kusret continues in Arabic in the background with Hakyolu providing a summary of his views] Rejecting reports that the PKK is infiltrating Turkey from Iraq, Kusret said that they are controlling the borders and are not allowing the PKK through. Nevertheless, he added that they need Turkey's support and that this problem could be completely solved through cooperation with Ankara. [end recording]
