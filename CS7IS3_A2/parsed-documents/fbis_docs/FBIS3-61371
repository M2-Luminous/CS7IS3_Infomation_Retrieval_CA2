The International Competition for Changing the 'Cover' Installation Is Over. But What Is Next?"] [Text] Just as the nuclear electric power station on the banks of the Pripyat River is firmly associated in our country with danger, misfortune, and grief, the word "Chernobyl" itself brings to mind the fourth unit of the AES [nuclear electric power station] that was demolished by a terrible explosion and the sarcophagus that was erected on its ruins, under whose arches there is now a simply fantastic amount of radioactive material--20 million curies. Many think that the "Cover" installation is airtight. Unfortunately, this is not so. During its construction, due to high radiation it was necessary to use remote methods, as a result of which the overall area of cracks in the sarcophagus totals about 1,000 square meters. Naturally, radioactive dust can easily penetrate through these to the outside. Given a failure in the internal structures, there is a serious danger for people working in the industrial area of the AES. Prominent specialists from many countries of the world who took part in the international competition, whose results were summarized in Kiev almost a half year ago, attempted to answer the question: "What should the new 'Cover' be like?" They had to take the most diverse circumstances into account. For example, to ensure against natural and other calamities, the new "Cover" should be calculated for an earthquake magnitude of seven (one higher than probable) and for a powerful hurricane, and even for the fact that an aircraft could fall on it. It is not without reason that it is said that the rarest event that occurs once in a thousand years could also occur tomorrow. It is written in the conditions of the competition that a contract is signed with its winner (or winners) for the implementation of their ideas. But nothing is being heard about the start of design work, not to speak of construction work. HAS THE INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION TURNED INTO A KIND OF POLITICAL GAME ORGANIZED AROUND CHERNOBYL? A PRAVDA UKRAINY correspondent put this question to Professor Vladimir Tokarevskiy, doctor of physico-mathematical sciences and general director of the "Cover" interbranch scientific-technical center of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. [Tokarevskiy] Such a point really was stated in the conditions, but it was changed in March of this year: The winner received an opportunity to reach the final stage of the so-called tender--the competition for the right to acquire a contract. In this case, this was the conduct of a feasibility study for the design work. In essence, this decision of the organizational committee was like extending the competition for an unlimited period. [Kiyanskiy] What, for example, would soccer fans say if the rules of the game were changed in the course of a match?! In my opinion, behavior like this is not permitted in civilized countries... [Tokarevskiy] An exceptional circumstance compelled us to do this. It remained absolutely unclear as to who would pay for the TEO [feasibility study] and the design work, and what is most important, who would be able to finance the construction. If the conditions remained as before, the Ukrainian Government would simply prove to be unable to fulfill them and to sign a contract with the winner. And this, you will agree, is far worse than making corrections. [Kiyanskiy] Perhaps it is appropriate here to mention an old anecdote from the "vintage" series. At the beginning of the 1930's, Rothschild was approached by representatives of the Soviet Ministry of Finance with a request to borrow a very large sum. Why do you need so much money? asked the famous banker. They explained to him politely: for the construction of socialism. "In my opinion, when there is no money, it is not necessary to build," Rothschild replied. [Tokarevskiy] The story is amusing, but I do not see the analogy here. The sarcophagus cannot wait. Every lost month is fraught with problems. [Kiyanskiy] As I understand it, the French offered the means... [Tokarevskiy] Only for the feasibility study and (to a lesser degree) for the project. If we had agreed to their conditions, we would have impeccably formulated documents, beautifully executed sketches, and they possibly would even be able to lay down a certain "zero" cycle. And they would have received the usual long-range construction project, for there was no money for the completion of construction. To finance all the work the Ukrainian Government would need, according to various estimates, from $500 million to $2.5 billion, and the French were giving $10-15 million. As you see, the sums are not compatible... Before starting any kind of a job, it should be known exactly how to complete it. The World Bank or the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development are able to guaranteeing real financing for the grandiose project. It would be possible to resolve the problem successfully if we were actively assisted by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Commission of the European Community, and an international fund established specially to finance the Chernobyl project, say, at the request of the presidents of Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus. The sum of $500 million is really not such a large amount for the entire world community. [Kiyanskiy] The authors of one of the drafts that was submitted for the competition proposed pouring concrete into the destroyed unit and transforming it into a monolith. Why was their idea rejected; after all, the resources needed for its implementation would be much less than other projects? [Tokarevskiy] By transforming the unit into a monolith we would increase the volume of radioactive waste, and would thereby be behaving like the poor housekeeper who scoops all the rubbish into one corner in the hope that someone will take it away later. As the result of such an operation, instead of hundreds of cubic meters of radioactive waste, we would get millions of cubes of "contamination." But this, you will agree, is unethical with respect to our progeny, on whose shoulders we would place such a heavy burden. If a catastrophe that is unprecedented in human history occurred because of our tragic mistakes, then the efforts that are applied to the elimination of its consequences must be just as great. The present generation is obliged to cope with the accident of the century. Unfortunately the international competition jury, about which we have already spoken with you, was compelled to state that not one of the submitted works makes it possible to resolve the problem comprehensively: It is impossible, for example, to take the French draft, considered to be the best, and start construction on its basis. The jury decided not to award the first prize. It thereby declared to the whole world that, unfortunately, a ready solution does not exist today. The problem proved to be far more complicated than we thought just several years ago. [Kiyanskiy] But sooner or later the construction will nonetheless begin. Hundreds of trucks will begin to move up to the unit, and various mechanisms will start to work in the industrial area. Many will speak up about the danger that dust will be raised, and that the wind will carry the nuclides to nearby villages and cities. Radioactive particles will fall into the soil and water... [Tokarevskiy] Well, you know, fear makes mountains out of molehills. If such fears are expressed by the broad public, then specialists have already thought about this first and foremost. We consider dust suppression to be one of the most important problems. In the course of a day approximately 22,000 liters of air pass through a person's lungs, and you and I consume about two kilograms of food on average. This means that incomparably more nuclides can get into the human body through breathing than through eating. It is for this reason that the requirements for clean air are much stricter. Dust suppression systems will begin to function as soon as construction work around the sarcophagus is started. The contaminated soil of 1986 by the walls of the sarcophagus is now at a depth of three to nine meters: It was covered with clean earth at one time for the purpose of decontaminating it. But, of course, we will have to remove the "cultured layer," which is contaminated with radiation. As for removing blockages and dismantling damaged structures inside the sarcophagus, this will begin to be done only after the erection of the airtight shell of "Cover-2." [Kiyanskiy] But after all, nuclides can get into not only the air and ground, but also into subsoil water... [Tokarevskiy] Indeed, this is one of the most complicated and, alas, still unresolved problems today. As recent measurements indicate, there has been no record, fortunately, of migration through any kind of loose joints or cracks in the foundation of the sarcophagus. However, we will not forget about the enormous amount of radioactive materials located here. I repeat, there is no migration at this time. But if we become convinced that it has appeared, it will obviously not become easier for anyone. Therefore, any delays in the construction of "Cover-2" are fraught with the most serious consequences. We have been allotted only five years for everything--and not a month longer.
