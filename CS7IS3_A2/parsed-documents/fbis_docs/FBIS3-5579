However, most of these investments were not in the right category as it did not benefit this nation much, in terms of technology transfer or resource utilisation. New investments will be diverted to the right sector to enable mutual benefits. Minister of Finance, Sam Rangsi, told the CAMBODIA TIMES that the country has done remarkably well for a young and infant liberal democracy. "Vietnam, with a bigger population and resource base, has reportedly attracted U.S. $1 billion in foreign investments. However, many of them are cautious as it is not a gold mine as many believe. The lifting of the trade embargo on Vietnam by the United States will also not have any major material effect on the flow of foreign investment here." "Our sustained efforts to show consistency in immigration and investment policy and the promotion of transparency in laws, regulations and procedures, will see the influx of more investors here in the near future. Within the next few weeks, we will see major multi-national companies, with a strong reputation, resource base and expertise, signing business agreements as well as announcing business ventures and investments here." "These are the type of investors we need. We do not need bad investors who are here just to reap the country of its resources in limited industries such as logging, timber, gems and unhealthy sectors such as laundering of money," Rangsi said. "We will chase out the bad investors who do not represent the true business community here and replace them with new, serious and big companies with reputable international standings. These will be seen very soon." "Priority, said the Finance Minister, would be given to the manufacturing sector, tourism, transportation and infrastructural sectors." [passage omitted] "Other measures to encourage investors are the writings of the new investment law which will be submitted at the ICORC [International Conference on the Reconstruction of Cambodia] meeting soon and which has been in principle approved by the Royal Government." "We are also looking into the formation of new laws pertaining to investments. These include company laws, bankruptcy laws and land laws. At the moment there is no land law and this has been a hindrance to investment. This is because many plots of land have more than one land title as a result of irregularities and inadequacies at the land department. This has to be resolved as an investor would not want to establish a manufacturing plant on a plot of land which is in dispute in the future."
