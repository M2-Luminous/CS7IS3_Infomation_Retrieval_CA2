FR941128-1-00029 FR941128-1-00005 In response to a request made by the American Petroleum Institute (see footnote 3), two new models for treating toxic air pollutant releases are being proposed for addition to appendix B of the Guideline. These models, SLAB and HGSYSTEM, will then accompany DEGADIS, another appendix B model for treating dense gas releases for use on a case-by-case basis. (See footnote 2.) Administrative Requirements A. Executive Order 12866 Under Executive Order (E.O.) 12866 [58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)], the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs of the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Order. It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of E.O. 12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review. B. Paperwork Reduction Act This final rule does not contain any information collection requirements subject to review by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. C. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ) requires EPA to consider potential impacts of regulations on small ``entities''. The action here proposed is a supplement to the notice of final rulemaking that was published on July 20, 1993 (58 FR 38816). As described earlier in this preamble, the revisions here proposed as supplement C to the Guideline encompass the use of new model algorithms and techniques for using those models. This rule merely updates existing technical requirements for air quality modeling analyses mandated by various Clean Air Act programs (e.g., prevention of significant deterioration, new source review, SIP revisions) and imposes no new regulatory burdens. As such, there will be no additional impact on small entities regarding reporting, recordkeeping, compliance requirements, as stated in the notice of final rulemaking ( op. cit. ). Furthermore, this proposed rule does not duplicate, overlap, or conflict with other federal rules. Thus, pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), EPA hereby certifies that the attached proposed rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of such entities. List of Subjects 40 CFR Part 51 Administrative practice and procedure, Air pollution control, Intergovernmental relations, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Ozone, Sulfur oxides, Nitrogen dioxide, Lead, Particulate matter, Hydrocarbons, Carbon monoxide. 40 CFR Part 52 Air pollution control, Ozone, Sulfur oxides, Nitrogen dioxide, Lead. Authority: This notice of proposed rulemaking is issued under the authority granted by sections 110(a)(2), 165(e), 172(a) & (c), 173, 301(a)(1) and 320 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2), 7475(e), 7502(a) & (c), 7503, 7601(a)(1) and 7620, respectively. Dated: November 7, 1994. Carol M. Browner, Administrator. Parts 51 and 52, Chapter I, Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations are amended as follows: PART 51_REQUIREMENTS FOR PREPARATION, ADOPTION, AND SUBMITTAL OF IMPLEMENTATION PLANS 1. The authority citation for part 51 continues to read as follows: Authority: 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2), 7475(e), 7502(a) and (b), 7503, 7601(a)(1) and 7620. §51.112 [Amended] 2. In §51.112, paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) are amended by revising ``and supplement B (1993)'' to read ``, supplement B (1993) and supplement C (1994)''. §51.160 [Amended] 3. In §51.160, paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(2) are amended by revising ``and supplement B (1993)'' to read ``, supplement B (1993) and supplement C (1994)''. §51.166 [Amended] 4. In §51.166, paragraph (l)(1) and (l)(2) are amended by revising ``and supplement B (1993)'' to read ``, supplement B (1993) and supplement C (1994)''. 5. Appendix W to Part 51, section 4.2.2, is amended by revising footnote 1 in Table 4&hyph;1 to read as follows: Appendix W to Part 51_Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised) * * * * * 4.2.2␣*␣*␣* Table 4&hyph;1. *␣*␣* ␣ 1␣ 1Land Use 1Model1 *␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣* 1The models as listed in this table reflect the applications for which they were originally intended. Several of these models have been adapted to contain options which allow them to be interchanged. For example, ISCST2 could be substituted for ISCLT2. Similarly, for a point source application, ISCST2 with urban option can be substituted for RAM. Where a substitution is convenient to the user and equivalent estimates are assured, it may be made.
