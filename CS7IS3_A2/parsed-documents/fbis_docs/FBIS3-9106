[Filkus] It is certainly the budget. I am not saying that we shall have to revise it. We shall nonetheless have to subject it to an appraisal from the viewpoint of revenues and expenditure. The situation in sectors that are dependent solely on revenues they receive from the state budget, such as the health, educational, and cultural sectors, is especially bad. We shall have to take another look at them. [passage omitted] The problem I shall have to start tackling beginning tomorrow is to report to the public and signal to it that I have taken over the economy in such a state, with such currency reserves, such a budget deficit, such a degree of unemployment, such a relationship between the growth of labor productivity and wages. My task will be to inform the public about macroeconomic options we have. [Correspondent] What kind of picture have you formed about steps you shall have to take regarding the very burning problem of the stability of money? [Filkus] First, I believe the center that is to look after the stability of money is the National Bank. It possesses basic macroeconomic criteria with which it can judge what to do or not do within the framework of the stability. You must surely have in mind the process of devaluation and the like. This must be done by the bank in accordance with its own judgement. The Finance Ministry ought not to interefere in this matter. The Finance Ministry may give assistance, but the consideration and decision should be made by the National Bank only in accordance with the criteria the bank has at its disposal. No one should interefere in this process.
