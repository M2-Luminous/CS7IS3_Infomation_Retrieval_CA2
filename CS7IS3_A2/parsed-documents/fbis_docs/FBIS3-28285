"As finance minister, I cannot take responsibility for compiling the national budget." These were the words of complaint that an infuriated Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii made to Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who had hinted at separating the issue of a consumption tax increase from an income tax cut, after Fujii marched into the Prime Minister's Office on the morning of the same day. Such remarks are rather unusual at a time when the process of drafting the budget is in its final stages. Fujii expressed his strong determination that he "is prepared to resign" if a consumption tax hike were to be shelved. After registering his complaint with Takemura, Fujii held a news conference and said: "It is the basic policy of the government to treat them (tax cut and tax hike) as a single package. I would like the ruling coalition party representatives to finalize opinions within their parties within this framework." While the gloomy atmosphere of a possible Diet dissolution and subsequent general elections made a remarkable turnaround with the passage of the political reform bills, Takemura had made his earlier remarks at a time when the Finance Ministry felt that "hopes have revived concerning the possibility of a consumption tax increase" (as stated by a senior Finance Ministry official). Thus, the ministry all the more hopes to put the brakes on the idea of shelving a consumption tax hike from becoming widespread. Senior officials of the Finance Ministry's Tax Bureau have visited such places as the Diet Members' Office Building in an earnest effort to try to persuade politicians to support the ministry's idea to have the amount of the consumption tax hike and the date of its implementation expressly stated in the tax bills. One senior Finance Ministry official said: "It is all or nothing regarding the consumption tax hike. Either it will be written in the law or not." The ruling coalition parties have maintained that "it would be satisfactory to spend one to two years coming up with a final decision." The official's understanding is that if the ministry agreed to this coalition plan to carry over debate on a consumption tax hike to the next Diet session, "it would in fact be equivalent to having given up on securing a source of revenue." After attending a meeting of the Council on Economic Issues held on the evening of the same day, Fujii told reporters, "The government has confirmed that it will treat income tax cuts and a consumption tax hike as a single package." He thus stressed that no changes have been made to the original plans. When asked whether the amount of the consumption tax increase and the date of its implementation would also be decided in the same package, Fujii smiled and said, "They will be treated as a single package."
