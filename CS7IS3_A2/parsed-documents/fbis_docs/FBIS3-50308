Article 43 of the Czech Constitution allows for armed forces to be sent onto territories outside the Czech Republic only with the consent of both houses of parliament. Article 39 provides for foreign troops to be stationed in the Czech Republic on condition that an absolute majority of members of the Senate agree. Speaking on a television discussion program this evening, Baudys stated that the Partnership for Peace plan has both a political and military layer. States seeking to join needed to fulfill certain criteria, he said, such as the transparency of military budget and plans, democratic control over the armed forces and their ability to take part in UN actions, be they humanitarian or protective. He said Partnership for Peace represented a phase in which applicant countries should demonstrate their mental, military, and above all political compatibility with NATO's existing members. Baudys estimated the cost of implementing the project this year at only a few hundred million korunas. The plan envisaged both joint operations and the dispatch of army specialists to Brussels, he said.
