FR940317-1-00183 FR940317-1-00015 A comprehensive study of the adverse effects of commercial air sightseeing tours on wildlife in parks has yet to be concluded. Studies to date indicate that aircraft can be associated with stress responses on a number of animals, including migratory birds. Endangered species, like the grizzly bear in Glacier National Park, can be harassed by commercial air tour operators unaware of the potential adverse effects of flying too close to them. Other mammals like desert bighorn sheep, dear, and elk that have found refuge in parks can be panicked and stressed by low-flying aircraft, as well. No studies that evaluate long-term effects on wildlife, including population level impacts of commercial air sightseeing tours, have been conducted. As with any potential impact associated with activities in parks, the NPS policy is to err on the side of resource protection until conclusive information is available that would indicate otherwise. Assessing Noise Impacts The FAA is working with the NPS to define acceptable noise levels as the basis for any proposed limitations on aircraft overflights. This process involves identifying areas with the highest levels of noise sensitivity. Highly sensitive areas potentially would be subject to lower noise limits than would apply to other areas with higher ambient noise levels, based on resource values, types of use, or other factors. Depending on local conditions, alternative approaches may be employed in different areas to achieve the same noise goal. Current FAA policy and guidelines designate the yearly day-night average sound level (DNL) as the single noise metric for measuring aviation impacts on people in and around airports. This traditional metric alone may not be appropriate for assessing aviation noise impacts in parks and wilderness areas. Three supplemental metrics other than DNL are proven and appear particularly suitable for site-specific assessments. These are Equivalent Sound Level (L eq ), Sound Exposure Level (SEL) and Time Above a dBA Threshold (TA). Additionally, defining a change of 5 dB as significant at any initial DNL level may be appropriate for specifying further noise analysis in parks and wilderness areas. The ongoing NPS studies have identified two potential (dose-response relationships that also may be appropriate for assessing aircraft noise impacts. These are ``Annoyance vs. Percent Time Heard'' and ``Interference with Quiet vs. Percent Time Heard.'' These relationships are preliminary and must be subjected to rigorous analysis for further determination of their potential application. Policy Considerations In reviewing potential alternatives for achieving NPS and FAA purposes, the FAA has considered a number of measures within its authority under the FAAct that would have the potential to address the problems identified by the NPS. In determining whether a particular action would be beneficial for this purpose and otherwise feasible, the FAA and NPS must take into account a number of legal and policy considerations. The action, if regulatory, must be consistent with Administration rulemaking principles as set forth in Executive Order 12866. These principles include requirements that regulations be drafted in the most cost-effective manner to achieve the objective; that regulations be based on the best reasonably obtainable scientific, technical, economic, and other information concerning the need for and consequences of the action to be taken; and that regulations be tailored to impose the least burden on society, including individuals, businesses, and communities, consistent with obtaining the regulatory objective. The action must have no adverse effect on aviation safety. The action should have the minimum possible adverse effect on the efficiency of air navigation, consistent with the regulatory objective, and should not unduly burden interstate commerce. It must also meet NPS requirements for protecting resources, assuring that there is no impairment, and that there is no derogation, to park resources and values. The action should focus directly on the problem rather than indirectly. For example, if the issue is the adverse impacts of overflights of a unit of the national park system, then the agency action will address those overflights directly, rather than seek to influence them through regulation of takeoffs and landings at a nearby airport. Options for Evaluation The FAA and NPS believe that each of the following measures may have some utility, in certain circumstances, as a measure to mitigate the adverse effects of commercial air sightseeing tour overflights of units of the national park system. Inasmuch as some of the measures have not been used before, neither the FAA nor NPS has concluded that such actions would meet the legal and policy considerations summarized above, and specific comment is requested on the benefits, costs, and impacts of each.
