Replying to the debate, the education minister, Mr. K. Ponnuswamy, allayed fears there would be interference in the day-to-day functioning of the universities. He claimed that it is well within the legislative competence and jurisdiction of the house to make the chief minister chancellor of the universities. The Congress-I, the Janata Party, the CPI [Communist Party of India], the CPI-M [Communist Party of India-Marxist] and the MGR Anna DMK [M.G. Ramachandran Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam] parties have criticized the Tamil Nadu Government for violating federal principles and showing disrespect to the governor by bringing forward the bills. They expressed the view the bills would pave the way for encroachment in the day-to-day functioning of the universities.
