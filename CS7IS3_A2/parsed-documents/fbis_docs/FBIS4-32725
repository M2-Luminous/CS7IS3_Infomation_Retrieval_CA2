Although the government coalition deputies refused to include the issue in the agenda of the current session, it is compulsory to convene extraordinary session if a motion is supported by more than 30 deputies. The opposition has already put the motion of no-confidence to Privatisation Minister Milan Janicina (NDS) on the agenda of the session. The Slovak Parliament dismissed today Ivan Luptak (HZDS, Movement for a Democratic Slovakia) from the Slovak delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. At the past parliamentary session Luptak expressed his discontent with the work of Cernak, parliament deputy chairman, by using the Nazi salute. Luptak had been reprimanded for his behaviour by his own HZDS Deputies' Club as well as the parliamentary Mandate Committee. He had apologised to the parliament and assured it that he was an opponent of totalitarian rule. He said, however, that he preferred to be dismissed than appointed by the present government. The importance of his dismissal is rather symbolical because Slovak deputies will not go to Strasbourg before the parliamentary elections scheduled for September 30-October 1, Parliament Chairman Ivan Gasparovic said.
