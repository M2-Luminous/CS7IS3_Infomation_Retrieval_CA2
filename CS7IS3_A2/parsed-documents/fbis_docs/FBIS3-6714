The hike is the lowest since a 1.55 percent increase implemented in 1987, when the Japanese economy was hit by a recession induced by a strong yen. Major electric machinery makers also decided on a 3.1 percent wage increase, down 0.5 percentage point from the previous year and their lowest ever. The sources said management at the firms originally tried to curb fiscal 1994 wage hikes as much as possible but finally became more concessionary. They said steelmakers softened their stance because of planned large-scale restructuring involving labor cuts. Nippon Steel Corp., Japan's top steelmaker, for instance, plans a cut of 7,000 employees. Managers of electric machinery firms, meanwhile, have taken into account a firm business showing in recent months, especially for microchips and heavy electric machinery, the sources said. Unions with electric machinery firms and steelmakers both belong to the Japan Council of Metal Workers' Unions. The car, shipbuilding and heavy electric machinery industries, also council members, are still in the middle of negotiations on the monthly wage hikes. Shipbuilding and heavy electric machinery firms originally demanded a 3.41 percent, or 10,000 yen, rise in the monthly wages, citing a relatively healthy performance of the industry, but management has maintained that a high wage increase would undermine the industry's international competitiveness.
