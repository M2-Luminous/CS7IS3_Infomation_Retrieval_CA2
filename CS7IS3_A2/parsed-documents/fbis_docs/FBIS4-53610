On the other hand, however, despite Japan's financial contribution, the number of Japanese working for international organizations is far less than that of foreigners. Staff members of international organizations are required to remain neutral as international servants. However, there is the expectation that they will serve as an important diplomatic channel for their respective countries. In view of this, there is concern that the lack of Japanese staffers in international organizations will affect Japan's efforts in forming its future international strategy. Since 1991, the World Bank, which finances long-term development loans with low interest rates to developing nations, has sent a staff member to its Tokyo office as a manager of Japanese staff members. The reason the World Bank is seeking Japanese for staff members is that "since Japan's ODA has increased, it has increasingly become necessary for us to promote a dialogue through Japanese staff members with the Japanese Government on policies for helping developing nations" (according to the World Bank Tokyo office). However, at present, the number of Japanese working for the World Bank headquarters is 100, 2.11 percent of the total staff members. Those Japanese staff members are all in senior posts, such as economic analysts. As far as a ratio of appropriation of funds to the World Bank is concerned, Japan comes second to the United States (17.4 percent). But when a percentage of staffers is considered, Japan is not only far behind the United States (25.62 percent) but also falls behind the UK (7.16 percent), whose funds appropriation ratio is 4.6 percent, which is lower than Japan's. Even in other international organizations, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the number of Japanese staff members is far less than other nations. Although Japan is the second-largest financial contributor to both the IMF and OECD following the United States among five industrialized nations (Japan, the United States, Germany, the UK, and France), the number of staff members working as expert or senior officials is the smallest. Yasushi Takase, professor of Tokai University Law Department who worked for GATT for nearly 30 years and retired in March 1992, said that underlying Japan's falling behind in providing human resources contribution is the fact that, "besides the lack of language proficiency, Japanese interest in working for international organizations is languishing due to a sharp increase in salaries in Japan." However, it is strongly requested both at home and abroad that the Japanese Government increase its staff members so that Japan will be able to have more diplomatic channels to foreign nations and Asian nations' policies can be reflected in policies of the international organizations. It can be said that "it is time for Japan to send competent personnel from government organs and the private sector to international organizations that are strategically important to Japan" (as stated by Professor Takase).
