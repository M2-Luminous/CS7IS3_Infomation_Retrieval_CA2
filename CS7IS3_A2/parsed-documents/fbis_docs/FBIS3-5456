This is a natural outcome of discontent with Japan, which evades the essence of the question each time by making up for poor U.S.-Japan relations in an impromptu manner. In fact, the United States put forward an offensive trade policy "befitting" the post-Cold War era during the summit with Japan last month. In other words, it declared that there will be no more "empty" joint statements to be adopted merely for the sake of formalities between the allies. Thus, there is an indication that so-called managed trade [kwalli muyok], which is intended to reduce red figures in trade with Japan by establishing a quantitative standard in the U.S. export of commodities to Japan, will become the U.S. strategy. The revival of Super 301 can be seen as an extension of the offensive trade policy suggested during the summit. We fully understand the discontent with Japan roaring in across U.S. society. In fact, there is no such a nation like Korea which has been exhausted by the closed economy of Japan which dashed only toward the balance in the black. Nevertheless, we cannot stand on the U.S. side. In other words, we have no objection to the fundamental principle of encouraging Japan to realize the inevitability of opening up. However, we cannot agree with the method of the U.S. practice. The World Trade Organization [WTO], which 118 nations agreed to jointly establish during the talks in Geneva last December, has not yet been officially formed. At this very point, Super 301, which seeks unilateral sanctions and retaliation, has been revived. Thus, its revival can be said as an unjust, dangerous act of disturbing settlement and development of the WTO, which intends to pursue opening and multilateralism. Moreover, the red figures in U.S. trade are attributable to its own chronic financial red figures and to the trend of its excessive consumption. Therefore, once the United States assumes an offensive posture, retaliation will undoubtedly be expanded. This is because the ROK and Taiwan will attempt to fill up the vacuum created due to reduction in Japan's export of goods to the United States, and the United States will shift the target of retaliation on others. On the other hand, Japan's unilateral concession, designed to avoid retaliation, cannot be defined as the best method for problem settlement. If a solution to the pending problems is sought from the standpoint of managed trade, Japan's concession will merely heighten the possibility of Japanese business circles' "autonomous" expansion of imports of U.S. commodities, and will the reduce shares [chibun] of European and small countries' in the Japanese market. At this point, we would like to call on the United States to abandon managed trade and on Japan to boldly unbar the gate to its domestic markets. We also urge the ROK Government to seek solidarity forces in the multilateral trade system, in the Asian-Pacific conference, and in the Northeast Asian arena, instead of merely announcing protest statements and watching the trend of the situation, and to work out diversified strategy for national survival in a bid to expand the scope of choice. Our international circumstances may be aggravated to such an extent that even regionalism, which we do not wish, should be regarded as a supplementary step. From the outset, diplomacy is aimed at seeking the best result while preparing for the worst situation. The ROK should work to unite strength with other states in Northeast Asia by developing regional forums and should make efforts to persuade the United States and defend the multilateral trade system.
