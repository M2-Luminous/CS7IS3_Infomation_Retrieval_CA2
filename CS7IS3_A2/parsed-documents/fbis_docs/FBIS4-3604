IMF tallies show that government-consumption expenditure rates in all other major Asian countries were below 10 percent in 1992, except in South Korea, where the rate was 11.4 percent. Singapore and Indonesia had 9.6 percent rates, and Hong Kong an 8.6 percent rate. Government-consumption expenditures include spending on personnel, office equipment, rent, and payouts on debts. Government officials said the 17.2 percent was bloated by the 10 percent of GNP spent on personnel. Personnel spending in Japan and South Korea was 6 percent and 4 percent, respectively, in 1992. They said that spending on 700,000 government officials, half million-strong army, public schoolteachers, and on retired government employees' pensions added greatly to the governmet's burden. The huge spending on personnel not only is a waste of the nation's limited resources, but also reduces government effectiveness, they warned.
