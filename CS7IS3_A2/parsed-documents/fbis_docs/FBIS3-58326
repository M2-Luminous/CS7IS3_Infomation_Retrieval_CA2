Mr Major resolutely refused to be drawn on the issue yesterday as his appearance at the NATO summit in Brussels was disrupted by the deepening controversy over the private lives and financial affairs of Conservative MPs and ministers. Mr Major's difficulties have been compounded by the loss of two ministers in less than a week -- Lord Caithness, who resigned as minister for shipping after the apparent suicide of his wife, and Mr Tim Yeo, after disclosures about his extra-marital affair with a Tory councillor. Mr David Ashby, MP for Leics NW, forcefully denied last night reports that he had left his wife and was having a homosexual relationship with a male friend. He admitted he had shared a hotel bed in France with the man, but denied the imputation attached to what was a longstanding friendship. He was now reconciled with his Italian-born wife, Sylvana. With MPs back at Westminster today, Government whips are anxious to curtail the flood of disclosure, speculation and innuendo which was in full spate yesterday. Mr Waldegrave, Minister for Public Service, tried to play down what he called a "series of eccentric events" that would not deflect the Government from its job of running the country. "There is one real, terrible tragedy in all of this, the death of Lady Caithness," he said on Channel 4 News. "The rest of it is almost the stuff of pantomime -- the width of beds in hotels in France: we seem to have gone potty. The Government has better things to do than lecture people about private morals." At the weekend, Mr Major called for an end to moral "witch hunts" against Tories who had behaved foolishly in their personal lives and appealed for tolerance. But the question of private morality has become entangled in his Back to Basics campaign to the annoyance of ministers and the despair of backbenchers who felt the Government had turned the corner after a difficult year. In Brussels, Mr Major brushed aside questions on domestic events and would respond only to inquiries about the summit. Mr Hurd, Foreign Secretary, was equally unforthcoming when asked about recent scandals and whether the Tory Party was "dead on its feet." Later this week he is expected to join other ministers drafted in to try to salvage Back to Basics. Mr Major is intent on pressing ahead with the initiative to demonstrate that it applies across a wide range of policy--from education to law and order--and is not a new moral code for Government ministers or the nation. But while he sought to deflect questions about Back to Basics in Brussels, the debate raged in Britain on the eve of what promises to be a turbulent parliamentary session for the Government. Mr Patten, Education Secretary, said he could not remember a more fraught period for the party in his 14 years as an MP. "I think John Major has had a peculiarly difficult seven or eight days," he added on LBC radio. "We all have because of these events crowding in about people's alleged improprieties here, there and everywhere--the tragic death of Lady Caithness on Saturday [8 January]--I can't remember any time since I have been in the House when it has been so difficult." Lord Archer, the former Tory chairman, said the party had been,"blown off course" by recent events after a period when many had hoped its fortunes were on the mend. But he added: "In a few weeks' time, people will be getting down to things that really matter." In the Cabinet, arguments continued over the extent to which the Back to Basics philosophy should be founded on matters of personal morality. Mr Howard, Home Secretary, emphasised that the concept was about individual responsibility but "not preaching or hectoring". He added: "It does not involve those matters which are more the responsibility of the pulpit than politicians." Mr Redwood, the Welsh Secretary whose strictures against single mothers last summer prompted Opposition criticisms, said: "The moral and single parent issues are important to the Government." Backbenchers showed increasing irritation with the way the Back to Basics policy was unravelling and called on Mr Major to redefine it in a way that allowed no misunderstandings. Dame Jill Knight, MP for Edgbaston and an executive member of the Tory backbench 1922 Committee, said Back to Basics went wider than this "one rather narrow though extremely important aspect of responsibility." Mr Bill Cash, MP for Stafford, said: "The Government has got a policy about family values which I do think is sustainable irrespective of the fact that a number of people seem to have wandered off course." Mr James Cran, MP for Beverley, said: "Many of us want to see the Prime Minister and his ministers really getting down and reducing to black and white what his vision of Back to Basics is meant to be."
