The other ruling coalition parties have said, if the UN Security Council decides to impose economic sanctions on North Korea, "Japan should go along with them." However, Chairman Murayama of the SDPJ, which has maintained friendly relations with the Workers' Party of Korea in North Korea, has said, "Japan should work for dialogue with North Korea rather than go along with the economic sanctions immediately." There are concerns within the government and ruling coalition parties that a rift could be created in the coalition government depending on what action the SDPJ takes. The UN Security Council has begun studying the possibility of imposing economic sanctions against North Korea after it refused to allow inspections of its nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency. In response, the SDPJ, at a 24 March meeting of its Central Executive Committee, decided to speedily study its strategy in dealing with the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear development. It is possible that, during Diet deliberations, SDPJ cabinet members could be asked to vote on whether U.S. Forces in Japan impose a naval blockade against North Korea as part of economic sanctions. The party, therefore, has concluded that it needs to shape a party consensus on the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear development. The SDPJ plans to announce its official view after collecting information starting early this week. People in the SDPJ are increasingly cautious about how to handle the issue. Secretary General Kubo says the party wants to "adopt a policy of dialogue with North Korea" on the grounds that: 1) It fears that North Korea might respond to external pressure by acts of terrorism; and 2) there is no guarantee that the imposition of economic sanctions against North Korea will force the country to accept the nuclear inspections. For this reason, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and other ruling coalition parties are saying "it is difficult to predict whether the SDPJ will announce a responsible policy on the issue as a ruling party." It is said the SDPJ has always been "pro-North Korea" in its longstanding policy on the Korean peninsula. The SDPJ normalized its relations with South Korea when former Chairman Yamahana visited that country last September. There is a feeling the relationship between the SDPJ and the Workers' Party of Korea is not in good shape. The SDPJ, however, plans to continue its friendly relations with the Workers' Party of Korea. The U.S. Congress is concerned that the "Hosokawa government may not be able to deal resolutely with the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear development because cabinet members have close ties with North Korea." A Shinseito source said some people in the ruling coalition parties are wary of the SDPJ, saying "we will have to work so as not to produce a useless international misunderstanding."
