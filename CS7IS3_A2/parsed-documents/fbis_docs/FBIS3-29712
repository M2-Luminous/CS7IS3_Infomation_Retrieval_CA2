The Eagle Space Airport along with TASCO's two other projects-- the Thai Aircraft Maintenance Co Ltd (TAMCO) and The Eagle Flying Club -- will be located on 1,400 rai in Ratchaburi province, 20 minutes' flying time from Bangkok. Financial backing for the project has come from Nava Finance and Securities, Krung Thai Bank and a number of other financial institutions. The airport will be the first general aviation airport and together the three projects will provide "integrated aviation- related services", according to TASCO managing director Prarom Mokawet. "There are some private airports in Thailand but they do not accommodate public planes. This airport will be the first one in the country to be registered with the civil aviation board for public use," said Mr Prarom. "We will be able to accommodate and maintain all `light' aircraft smaller than a Boeing 737," he said. The initial runway will be 1.4 kilometres in length with two taxi ways, and facilities at the airport will be able to handle up to 400 planes. A 155-room hotel and resort complex to be managed by the Radisson group will also be part of the Eagle Space Project. At first the firm will concentrate purely on smaller private aircraft but if the project is successful it will consider enlarging facilities to accommodate large commercial aircraft as well. At present maintenance of aircraft in the country can only be carried out by Thai Airways International, so many private aircraft are sent to Singapore for servicing, resulting in a loss of considerable revenue to Thailand. But, Mr Prarom pointed out, "the private sector in Thailand has never really ventured into any large-scale aviation ventures and since we are subject to Civil Aviation regulations we do not want to launch into a large-scale commercial airport that would be in competition with existing government ones. The aim is to support government aviation," he said. As yet TASCO has no competitors but Mr Prarom believes that other groups will soon become very interested in establishing more private airports. The second project, TAMCO, is an aircraft maintenance operation that will be a joint venture between TASCO and THAI. "At present we are making a feasibility study in conjunction with THAI, who subject to agreement will be our partner in TAMCO," he said. Both partners would provide equipment, but THAI would provide personnel alone as it was very difficult to find highly-trained staff in the private sector, Mr Prarom said Maintenance will be available for all private aircraft as well as THAI and Bangkok Airways planes. The Eagle Flying Club for both local and foreign flying enthusiasts will provide equipment for pilots and flying lessons. The completion date for the entire project has been set for late 1996 or 1997. TASCO has future plans to establish helicopter ambulance services and to work in conjunction with both the police and traffic monitoring services.
