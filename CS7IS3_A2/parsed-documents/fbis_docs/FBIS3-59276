This is a reorganization and a new breakthrough in the system in the aftermath of the family-based, output-related contract responsibility system as the rural management organs adapt to the market economy and the development of the productive forces. What is the future of the development of this management style? What intrinsically brought on this new style? What general and specific policies should we adopt now? We brought these questions to Guangdong, Shandong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hubei, and Hebei as we conducted our investigations and studied other typical local examples. In association with NONGCUN TONGXUN ZAZISHI [RURAL COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE PUBLISHER], we invited comrades from relevant research units to a symposium in which the following basic viewpoints were developed: Various Forms of the Shareholding System and Shareholding Cooperative System Are Becoming an Important Management Style and Organizational System in the Rural Areas 1. Like the family-based, output-related contract responsibility system, the rural shareholding system and shareholding cooperative system are chosen from among mass practices and are the peasants' own magnificent creation. In recent years, especially since Comrade Xiaoping's southern-tour speech and the 14th National Party Congress, in the wake of the development of the rural productive forces and the growth of the market economy, the development of different forms of rural shareholding system and shareholding cooperative system has gained momentum, and they have become increasingly widespread. Among industries, not only have they appeared in many township enterprises but they have become popular in the forestry and fishery industries and are gradually spreading to the planting and breeding industries. Regionally, not only have they developed quickly along the coastal areas and the suburbs, but they are also growing in the central regions and showing up in many western areas. In many localities, what used to be the spontaneous action of the peasants and the grass-roots cadres has turned into deliberate decisions at the leadership level. In the wake of this vigorous development, these systems have taken on many forms, and it has become difficult to use one name to cover all of its rich contents. For simplicity's sake though, we will temporarily call them rural shareholding systems. 2. The rural shareholding systems of different trades have some common characteristics but also have their own features. Township enterprises' shareholding system is primarily a way to pool capital to set up factories. In some cases, the collectives contribute land, buildings, and equipment; the villagers contribute funds, technology, and labor; and shares are calculated based on the price of factors of production contributed. In other cases, it is not only a joint effort between the collectives and the villagers but units and individuals and even foreign businesses are also invited to buy shares. And there are cases which started out with collectives and peasants in individual townships and villages pooling resources to set up factories, using labor to attract capital or capital to attract labor. Everybody had the same number of shares, giving each person one vote. But as those enterprises developed and exceeded the share quota and the community-set limit on the public's share participation, the system was changed to give one vote to each share. We encountered a typical example of this kind in a shareholding enterprise in Laiyang City's Rulinbo Village in Shandong Province. The village set up the Terrazzo Company, Ltd. in June 1992. Each share was worth 100 yuan, and a total of 29,700 shares were sold, generating share capital of 2.97 million yuan. There are four kinds of stocks: One, collective shares -- the village itself bought shares using its houses and land-use rights and its own money; there are 13,420 such shares. Two, workers' shares -- the workers bought 3,400 shares with their own money. Three, public shares -- enterprises, institutions, and groups bought 1,000 shares. Four, foreign-invested shares --Hong Kong's Huayi Industrial Development Company bought shares with their transportation equipment, office equipment, and spot exchange, which converted to 11,880 shares. It took only four months for this enterprise to go from preparation to production, and it has already produced 10,000 sq m of terrazzo flooring material. The planting and breeding industries' shareholding system is similar to those of the township enterprises. Here we will use another example in Laiyang to explain the basic approach. A prototype is Tuanwang Township's method of pooling resources to build large, hothouse-type vegetable barns. Each share is worth 100 yuan, and there are 10,114 shares, generating 1.0114 million yuan in capital. Specifically, the township government bought 2,000 shares; two villages bought shares with their land and water conservancy facilities, which converted to 6,070 shares; the peasant households that contracted to work the barns bought 1,330 shares; the villagers' labor input converted to 714 shares. The township used this method to build 102 large vegetable barns which went into production last winter, and today, they are generating nearly a million yuan in income. Another typical example is the dairy cow farms set up in Tangezhuang township under a joint stock system. Each share is worth 1,000 yuan, and there are 271.1 shares, raising 271,100 yuan in capital. Specifically, the township's improved-breed farm contributed the dairy cows, land, and equipment and has 105 shares; two villages used their dairy cows and cash to buy 163 shares; the workers' cash input converted to 3.1 shares. This method brings into play not only the improved-breed farms' land, equipment, and technological superiority but also the two village's fund superiority and promotes the development of the cattle industry. The forestry industry's shareholding system primarily uses stock conversion and resource-pooling to develop tree farms. In Fujian's Sanming City, 80 percent of the villages use the shareholding cooperative system to set up tree farms. Specifically, one, the collective rights to the hillsides are converted into shares, known as hillside shares; two, trees, which are assets created by the villagers' labor input, planted after the cooperative effort began are converted into shares, known as basic shares; three, the villagers' input of cash, technology, and labor are converted to shares, known as investment shares. This approach is called "allocating shares but not the hillsides; distributing dividends but not the forests." Some localities have even crossed community boundaries and let the state-run units, village collectives, peasant households, and the general public set up tree farms and develop forestry resources. As for orchard management, the shareholding system is even more popular. For the fishery industry's shareholding system, collective fishing boats were converted to shares in the early days of reform, but it has since developed into a system where the fishermen pooled their resources to buy large fishing boats or used their boats to buy shares into fishing companies. These methods are constantly being developed in the coastal regions. Using the shareholding system to set up fish farms and develop fresh-water aquatics is increasingly popular in the interior provinces. Some fishermen pool their resources with other fishermen to set up joint operations; others pool their resoruces with the village collectives, and some ignore the boundaries between regions, trades, and ownership systems to pool their resources in their operations. In localities rich in fresh-water resources, such management styles have spread very rapidly. Hubei Province's Hanchuan County alone has 79 shareholding fish farms. Some production links have also adopted the method of raising capital and labor input as a way to pool resources and set up service projects and operate them like enterprises. Inner Mongolia's Qahar Qianqi has been using the shareholding system to run their electric motor-pumped wells since 1988. They have converted into shares their hydroelectric equipment purchased as collective investment or with state-support funds and the peasants' labor spent on drawing water, and the wells are managed like enterprises. Whoever water the land must pay, and the income earned is distributed according to the number of shares. Some localities pool their resources to set up farm-machinery service teams, repair services, and gas stations to serve the peasant households. The results have been very good. 3. The shareholding system not only has spread to many rural trades but has become a part of many different economic components. Many localities' village collective enterprises, community collective economic organizations, and individual private economies have introduced the shareholding system or have restructured themselves under the shareholding system. To reorganize themselves under the shareholding system, rural collective enterprises first sort out their assets and have them assessed. Equity rights are drawn up according to the primitive sources of the existing stock of assets; meanwhile, enterprise workers and the general public are invited to buy shares with cash. Generally, equity shares are divided into the following types: Village collective shares -- they are created by the village collective economic organizations' direct investments, and the shares belong to all members of the community; enterprise shares -- they are created by the enterprise's own profit retention, and the shares belong to the entire enterprise staff; staff allocated shares -- they are accumulated by the workers' labor and are only the basis for distribution and cannot be redeemed, transferred, put up as collateral, or bequeathed; workers' investment shares--they are newly created by the workers' cash input; public shares--they are created by group or individual investors; foreign-funded shares--they are created by foreign investors. The last three kids of investment shares can be redeemed, transferred, collateralized, and bequeathed. As far as we know, the earliest example of introduction of the shareholding system into the community collective economic organizations is in Zibo City's Changxing Village in Shandong Province. When this village was implementing the output-related constract responsibility system in the early 1980's, it already had five enterprises and more than 3 million yuan in fixed assets. In the course of promoting the separate household contract responsibility system, only the cheap, consumptive farm tools were distributed on the first day, and it went smoothly. On the second day, they simply could not find a way to allocate the village's nine cows: If several households shared one cow, it would be difficult to raise, and it would be of little use. Some people suggested slaughtering the cows and selling the meat for money. The party branch secretary halted the allocation process, and upon giving it a lot of thought, he came up with the idea of allocating shares but not the assets. After a thorough discussion by the villagers, this method was applied to most fixed assets. Subsequently, this village's economy really took off, and today, it has 15 industrial enterprises and has become the first village in the area to generate more than 100 million yuan in output value. In the wake of very rapid economic development, the collectives in Shenzhen City's Baoan District and Guangzhou's Tianhe District, which are at the leading edge of reform and opening up, have become increasingly wealthy, and the villagers are increasingly more vocal about participating in management and sharing in the profits. The collectives have also brought in the shareholding system. Their common approach is to assess the value of the communities' collective properties and convert them into shares. Some become collective shares, and some become personal shares. The collective shares' dividends are used on expanded reproduction and collective welfare; personal shares are only basis for dividend distribution and cannot be redeemed, transferred, put up as collateral, or bequeathed. Examples of individual private economies and household-run enterprises that are linked to the collectives adopting the shareholding system are fairly common in Zhejiang's Wenzhou, Anhui's Fuyang, and Guangdong's Shantou. Some of their enterprises occupy collective lands or factory buildings; some utilize the collectives' business reputation; some are given tax exemptions and reductions under the state's preferential policies, and they draw up property rights by converting their properties to shares. Perhaps it was for the purpose of expanding the business scope or for mobilizing workers' enthusiasm, or because of the state's preferential treatment toward the collective economies, or because of their intention to turn into a cooperative economy, some enterprises too have invited their own staff and workers or the community's own collectives to buy shares, or they sell shares to the public as a way of converting to the shareholding system or shareholding cooperative system and set up new operating mechanisms. 4. The different forms of rural shareholding system and shareholding cooperative system fall into two major categories. The first category is those businesses for which people pooled resources to create because they were motivated by the concentration of factors of production. In terms of the entities that actually pooled their resource, some are partnerships among peasants; some are partnerships between peasants and collectives; some are partnerships of different components, including peasants, collectives, the state's relevant units, social groups and individuals, and may even include foreign businesses, etc. In terms of the different forms of organization, some are integrated shareholding entities run by the peasants; some are enterprises whose shares are held internally; some are shareholding cooperatives and associations; some are shareholding companies that sell shares to the public; and some are enterprise groups pooling their resources. Their common characteristics are that they are all market-oriented, and efficiency is their goal, and profit is their link, and they put together funds, land, housing, equipment, technologies, labor and other factors of production by pooling resources and buying shares. They become economic communities with many property owners [as published] and become a productive force very quickly. Among such economic organizations, some are very much like cooperatives; others cross the boundaries that separate different trades, communities, and ownership systems and give one vote to each share and implement a decision-making system comprising of the shareholders, the board of directors, and factory directors (managers); they are very much like a modern shareholding system. The second category is the restructured entities motivated at first by the need to resolve the internal conflict of economic interests within the community collective economy and enterprises themselves. The common characteristic of these economic organizations is that they define property rights by assessing the original assets, converting them into shares, and setting up mechanisms to resolve the conflicts of interest among collectives and between the collectives and individuals. After the community collective economy and village collective enterprises adopted the shareholding system, because most equity shares allocated under the names of individuals cannot be redeemed, transferred, put up as collateral, or bequeathed; because the enterprises are managed democratically according to the principles of cooperation which give each person one vote, and because there is nonseverable common accumulation, it very much resembles a cooperative system. On the other hand, in the restructuring of the individual, private economy, some convert assets to shares or offer shares to the village collectives or enterprise workers while embracing the principles of the cooperative system; they are more like a cooperative system. Others convert assets or sell shares to the public and make decisions and allocations according to the principles of the shareholding system; they are more like the shareholding system. 5. Looking at the developmental trend, there is a tendency for the restructured shareholding economy to gradually merge with the newly created shareholding economy. While more and more rural economic organizations are being restructured under the shareholding system, they are also recruiting investors and pooling capital to expand enterprise scale and are gradually turning one-man-one-vote into one-man-multiple-votes and one-share-one-vote, thus displaying even more of the of characteristics of the newly created shareholding enterprises. For various reasons, practice has caused the rural shareholding system to resemble the cooperative system even more, and some localities have even named all economic alliances formed under the shareholding system the "shareholding cooperative system." If we look at international experiences, the cooperative system tends to have more vitality in the agricultural and tertiary industries while the shareholding system is more popular among the industrial enterprises. Judging by the law of development of the modern market economy and China's rural practices, the diverse forms of the rural shareholding system and shareholding cooperative system will become an important management style. As the township enterprises and other nonagricultural sectors develop, they may even become the primary management style in some localities. The Emergence of the Rural Shareholding System and Shareholding Cooperative System Was an Intrinsic, Objective Inevitability; They Will Play an Important Role in Promoting the Development of the Rural Socialist Market Economy 6. A precondition to the rural shareholding and shareholding cooperative systems' rapid development is the rapid development of the rural commodity economy and rapid market expansion. In this kind of economic environment, an economic organization must attain a certain scale, handle the internal interest relationships properly, improve management and administration, and enhance its own ability to adapt to changes in order to effectively enter the market place and expand its market share amid competition. The shareholding system and the shareholding cooperative system have flourished in recent years because they not only uphold the property owners' ownership rights in and the right to the profit generated by the factors of production but they also optimize the composition of various factors of production to meet the objective needs of the development of the rural socialist market economy. 7. The most striking feature of the rural shareholding system is its ability to gather various kinds of scattered factors of production and management quickly and create a new productive force quickly. Marx said, "If we had to wait for accumulation to enable a unit of capital to grow to the point that it could repair the railroad, I am afraid we still would not have a railroad today. But the shareholding companies can accomplish this task in no time." This ability of the shareholding system to raise capital is the main reason for its rapid development. In our investigation in Hubei's Xiangfan, we learned that the city began testing the shareholding cooperative system last year, and by March of this year, it has raised more than 300 million yuan and set up 1,820 shareholding cooperative projects. This left us with a even deeper impression of the fund-gathering ability of the shareholding system. Many localities have been able to use the shareholding cooperative system to block the massive flow of rural funds to the cities, and they have turned the peasants' consumption funds into production funds. Today, many localities' peasants not only have money in the banks but they also have idle money under their mattresses and in their suitcases. If we can use the shareholding system and the shareholding cooperative system, which the peasants are happy to accept, to gather the scattered funds and other factors of production and set up various production and management projects, it no doubt will have a tremendous effect on the development of the rural economy. 8. The rural shareholding system also helps to break the bounds of different regions, departments, trades, and ownership systems and uses the market economic mechanisms to optimize resource allocation and expand production and management scopes, so that the rural economy can become an even bigger and broader market. In our investigation, we saw an example of "chicken wings turning into airplane wings" that helped one rural economy take off. In 1989, Shandong's Yantai City's Dongmotang village greatly expanded its export of chicken wings and gained fame as a wealthy village. In 1990, it invested 12.5 million yuan and entered into a partnership with the railroad department to build railway freight yards. At that time, the central government leading comrades encouraged them, saying, "Think big, do big things, and you not only can build railway freight yards, you can even run a civilian airline." Last September, they really pooled resources with the Great Wall Airline Company. The shareholding company has helped this village that sits next to the airport and the railroad "take off." Last year, its total income topped 150 million yuan. This year, they have set up a Sino-foreign shareholding enterprise in a joint venture with some Hong Kong and Shenzhen companies. 9. The rural shareholding system plays an important role in perfecting the rural collective enterprises' management and administration system and operating mechanisms and in setting up an enterprise system that meets the needs of the development of the socialist market economy. In the rural areas, many of the village collective enterprises shared the same serious problem: they were unable to manifest all the attributes of a collective. The cadres said that the enterprises belonged to everybody, but the people said they belonged to the cadres. This problem reflected the collective enterprises' ill-defined property rights, inability to separate the government from enterprises, and inability to straighten the interest relationships. From the point of the relationship between enterprises and the village leadership, enterprises were still plagued by administrative interventions and unreasonable burdens. From the point of enterprises' internal relationships, there was no restraining mechanism, and the masses could not apply effective supervision. When the village enterprises adopt the shareholding system, property rights are defined when assets are converted to shares to create many property owners, and power, responsibility, and profit are integrated by share ownership. According to the masses, "the shareholding system links responsibility, profit, and hearts." A screw dropped on the floor is still one's property, and it will be picked up. A village cadre from Shandong's Laiyang said to us, "Once we gathered some cadres to visit Yantai and wanted to use the village-run enterprise's car. The factory director told us that we now had to answer to the board of directors above and the shareholders below and could no longer use the car as we pleased. He turned us down. This proves that the shareholding system can truly keep the village administrative organs in line so that the village enterprises can make their own management decisions, take responsibility for their own profits and losses, initiate their own development, and discipline themselves." 10. The rural shareholding system and shareholding cooperative system play an important role in stabilizing and perfecting the responsibility system -- led by the family-based, output-related contract system -- and in amplifying the two-tier management system and the socialized service system that integrate centralization and decentralization. Judging by local practices, using the shareholding system to develop the water conservancy project, the farm machinery service team, the large vegetable barns, the forests and orchards, etc., we can effectively enhance the service capability of collective centralized management, help to tap the family-based contract management system's potential, and solve problems individual families and households cannot solve. In some localities, the science and research units, the agricultural colleges, the supply and marketing departments, and the peasants unite under the shareholding system to form a new community that share the same interests, and that has improved the socialized agricultural system and has vigorously promoted high-output, high-quality, high-efficiency agricultural development. Policy Suggestions for Promoting Healthy Development of the Rural Shareholding System and the Shareholding Cooperative System 11. More and more people have come to recognize the important role of the rural shareholding system and the shareholding cooperative system in deepening the reform, promoting opening up, and promoting development. Some localities have made promoting the shareholding cooperative system an important move in the development of the rural socialist market economy. They provide careful guidance and active support, and they have had good results. But many localities are still not paying sufficient attention to the rural shareholding and shareholding cooperative system. Today, some problems are jeopardizing the healthy development of the rural shareholding system. Primarily: a) There are no definitive guiding ideology and complete policies and laws and regulations. Many grass-roots cadres fail to hold up state policies and are afraid to do anything. b) There is no minimum, unified understanding of the different kinds of rural shareholding system and shareholding cooperative system, nor is there a proper administrative system. For similar types of enterprises, some are registered as collective enterprises; others are registered as shareholding cooperative enterprises, shareholding enterprises, or private enterprises, and this makes the implementation of the tax, credit loan, and other policies chaotic. c) The rural shareholding system itself is under-developed; it is not standardized and not complete. With regard to assessing property values, determining equity rights, verifying equity shares, distributing share dividends, and circulating equity rights and so on, different localities and economic organizations have different methods that can vary significantly. For example to prove equity rights, some issue beautiful stock certificates, some issue share certificates, some issue receipts, and some issue no documented proof, which often leads to disputes. 12. The development of the shareholding system and shareholding cooperative system in essence is a reshaping of the rural micrcoeconomic organization to meet the needs of the market economy. In this respect, not only the masses of peasants and grass-roots cadres but also the decision-making strata of various levels and departments must go through a learning, understanding, and practical process. They must not be impatient and rush into mass action. Starting out from the reality of China's rural areas, perhaps the general principle for dealing with the different types of rural shareholding systems may be to "guide the action according to circumstances and set standards in gradual steps." Guiding the action according to circumstances means encouraging the peasants and using different forms of the rural shareholding system to combine the factors of production to promote the development of the rural socialist market economy. Regardless of which form, so long as it helps to raise the standard of the rural productive forces, it should be vigorously supported. We must base the development of the rural shareholding system on the standard of the rural productive forces and the wishes of the masses. We should never go against the people's wishes, even less should we use administrative orders to force them to do something. Setting standards in gradual steps means, as the system develops, we should use policies, laws and provisions, and regulations to put it on the legalized, institutionalized track. However, standardization does not mean rejecting diversification, even less stifling the creativity of the masses. 13. In order to promote the healthy development of the rural shareholding system, the following points urgently need to be further clarified: We should advocate using the shareholding system to raise capital to launch agricultural development, rural infrastructure, and hydroelectric power projects and other socialized services to stabilize and perfect the responsibility system as led by the family-based, out-put related contract system. We should encourage the village households to work with the state's relevant enterprises and institutional units and the general public to set up different types of township enterprises under the shareholding system. We should use examples to guide the village collective enterprises, delineate property rights based on their assessed value and their sources, and accept other shareholding systems when restructuring enterprises. Those who are not willing to change should not be forced to do so. We should allow community collective economic organizations to adopt the shareholding system and turn the collective economy into a shareholding cooperative economy. We should support the individual, private economies in restructuring themselves under the shareholding system. Share conversion must be fair and equitable. Stock participation should be voluntary. The principles of the cooperative system should also be brought in; the essence of the shareholding cooperative system should be recognized. We should encourage the people to use the shareholding system to achieve enterprise mergers and combinations and set up shareholding enterprises and enterprise groups. We should encourage people to cooperative with foreign businesses to set up "three kinds of wholly or partially foreign-owned" shareholding enterprises. In view of the fact that the rural shareholding system is already fairly widespread, we suggest prompt and proper formulation of some guiding principles and policies. This should be accomplished before the end of the year and should best be in the form of a central government or State Council special document. In order to formulate practical general and specific policies, we should do more investigations and studies and review the masses of peasants' creations and local practical experiences. We suggest that the pertinent departments diligently study and formulate legislation-type regulations. We must start out from the rural areas' actual conditions and reference the general principles of a modern market economy when setting legal standards. The departments should promptly come up with some suggestions on how to deal with problems that urgently need to be resolved -- such as assessment of the value of properties for stock conversion, registration of legal persons, and circulation of equity rights.
