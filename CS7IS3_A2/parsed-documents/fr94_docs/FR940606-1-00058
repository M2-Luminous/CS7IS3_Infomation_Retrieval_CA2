FR940606-1-00058 FR940606-1-00008 The recordkeeping requirements for inorganic HAP emissions from primers and topcoats, which require recording of the pressure drop across the filters or waterwash once per shift during which coating operations occur, were included to provide a means of obtaining data that can be used to verify that the pressure drop limits are not being exceeded. The records can also be used by the facility to determine when preventative maintenance should be performed on the filter or waterwash system. The proposed rule would also require that the log include the pressure drop operating range as specified by the manufacturer so that the compliance information is readily available at all times. c. Depainting operation. For compliance with the standard of no organic HAP emissions through the use of chemical strippers that contain no organic HAP, the minimum records identified were the name of each chemical stripper used in depainting operations, the organic HAP content of each stripper, and its supporting documentation. The proposed standards contain an exemption for spot stripping and decal removal that is based on an annual average volume of organic HAP-containing stripper per aircraft. To ensure that this exemption is being complied with, the EPA is proposing that the owner or operator of an affected source record these annual averages. Consequently, records must be maintained of the number of aircraft depainted, the volume of organic HAP-containing stripper used for spot stripping and decal removal, the average number of gallons of organic HAP-containing chemical stripper used per aircraft, and all supporting data and calculations. Similarly, the proposed standards have an exemption for radomes and parts depainting. While radomes are self-evident, the parts normally removed are not. Therefore, the EPA is proposing that each owner or operator keep an up-to-date list of all aircraft depainted at the facility and a list of all parts normally removed prior to depainting from each aircraft model. The EPA believes that it is necessary to ensure that, if a depainting facility uses organic HAP-containing chemical strippers, they only be used on spot stripping, decal removal, radomes and parts. Tracking the daily use of the organic HAP-containing chemical strippers by volume would indicate whether or not these strippers are being used on the aircraft body. The amount of stripper required to depaint an aircraft body is substantially higher than for the exempted operations. Therefore, an accounting of stripper usage is necessary to ensure organic HAP-containing stripper is not being used on the aircraft body. The EPA considered requiring records of the usage of both strippers that contain organic HAP and those that do not contain organic HAP be maintained. However, the EPA believes that requiring records of both types of stripper usage would be overly burdensome to the industry and that adequate accounting would be obtained from the usage of organic HAP-containing chemical stripper. In addition, records of the usage of organic HAP-containing strippers are already being required for spot stripping and decal removal. Consequently, the EPA is proposing that records be kept only of the organic HAP-containing chemical stripper usage. Daily recordkeeping of the usage of these strippers was considered to be unnecessary since the intent of the records is to show long-term trends. Annual records, on the other hand, would require too long of a period to establish these trends. Consequently, the EPA is requiring monthly records of the organic HAP-containing stripper usage. Whenever non-chemical depainting techniques are being used, the proposed standards would require that during periods of malfunction, alternate depainting methods be used for no more than 14 consecutive days unless the alternative method contains no organic HAP. In order to determine compliance with these requirements, records must be kept on the dates the malfunction occurred and was corrected, the methods used to depaint the aerospace vehicles during the malfunction, and the dates that these methods were begun and discontinued. For inorganic HAP emissions, records of the daily pressure drop readings are necessary to ensure that the requirements of the proposed standards are being met. The rationale for this requirement is identical to that presented for primers and topcoats. In addition, records must be maintained of the manufacturer's recommended pressure drop limits, the particulate filter control efficiency, and all test results, data, and calculations used in determining the control efficiency so that compliance determinations can be made.
