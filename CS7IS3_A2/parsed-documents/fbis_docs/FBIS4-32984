Henceforth, this authority will be centralized in the Presidency. Article one of Decree 21-94 reads: "The authority granted to ministries and autonomous and decentralized entities of the Executive Branch to establish, change, or modify any tax or to change the amounts of rates and the highest or lowest limits on corresponding fiscal fines is repealed." Different economic segments had been demanding for a long time the elimination of the ministers' discretionary authority, and this is part of the commitments the government made with the IMF to sign the ESAF [Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility]. Finance Minister Emilio Pereira and Eduardo Belli, deputy economy and development minister, yesterday unveiled before the local press a package of nine legal instruments that in the opinion of these officials "establish clear rules of the game to give confidence to productive sectors and allow them to grow at a faster pace than the current one." The package includes two agreements between the Finance and the Economy and Development Ministries, two Finance Ministry agreements, and five presidential decrees, including decrees 20-94 and 21-94. The former makes it obligatory to publish in the official gazette all the executive decrees and administrative provisions on fiscal matters. The latter repeals the discretionary authorities ministers had to create, change, or modify any tax. Decrees 22-94 and 23-94 create the Temporary Protection Tariff [Arancel Temporal de Proteccion] (ATP) and the Specific Consumption Tax [Impuesto Especifico al Consumo] (IEC), which repeal the Selective Consumption Tax (IBS) as of 1 July. In addition, decree 24-94 establishes the tariff ceilings for imported products, based on a timetable that establishes 37 percent as the maximum amount that can charged until 1 July 1995; 35 percent, until 1 January 1996; and 32 percent, until 1 January 1997. The ATP falls in line with the "exceptional and unequal treatment" the Central American governments granted to Nicaragua in the Guatemala Protocol and protects up to 750 kinds of products manufactured by local industries, products not produced in the country, although the established capacity to produce them exists. This holds true for products that may be produced in Nicaragua based on potential agroindustrial development. The ceilings established are 15 percent as of 1 June 1994, 12 percent as of 1 July 1995, 10 percent as of 1 January 1996, 5 percent as of 1 January 1999, until reaching 0 percent in 2000. According to Deputy Minister Belli, the APT will allow industrial modernization, establish "clear rules" until 2000, let industry reap the benefits of the Central American integration, and strengthen the competitive capacity of industries. "The ATP must be viewed as something that will allow the strengthening of productive sectors and must not be translated into [higher] prices for consumers, rather into productive capacity and more capital to cope with industrial modernization and penetrate new markets," Belli noted. In addition, the IEC eliminates the peculiarity of the "escalating" charge, which had drawn protests from merchants and industrialists. Unlike the IBS, which was paid in customs and in the sales prices, the IEC will only be paid on customs during the introduction of the imported product. The same decree establishes a special regime for imported goods of the so-called "fiscal industry," namely, sodas, liquors, and cigarettes, which will only be taxed on the sale price. The other decrees and ministerial agreements complement the aforementioned decrees. Pereira stated the agreements are the product of consensus with the Chamber of Industry of Nicaraguan [Cain] and the Chamber of Commerce. Cadin Vice President Jaime Bengochea and Chamber of Commerce President Roberto Teran accompanied the officials during the news conference and said they felt satisfied. "We are reaching an agreement that allows us to lay the groundwork for a tax reform that will take us into the 21st century," Pereira noted. Finance Deputy Minister Rene Vallecillo explained that the decrees seek to "influence through taxes the level and structure of consumption to transfer resources to the productive sector by means of public investments and loans for production." Vallecillo added that it is not that import taxes are going up, but that taxes for the import sector are being consolidated. "The idea is not to raise rates in some sectors, but the contrary, since rates on items such as home appliances, work vehicles, and farming spare parts have experienced a reduction or a restructuring," the official noted.
