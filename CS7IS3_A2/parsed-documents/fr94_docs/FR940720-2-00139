FR940720-2-00139 FR940720-2-00077 Members who fail to observe CBOE Rule 24.17 can be subject to a variety of sanctions. 4 The CBOE states that the fees suggested in the proposed rule change, like the fees imposed currently under CBOE Rule 24.17, do not constitute disciplinary action. Nevertheless, the review procedures in Chapter 19, ``Hearings and Review,'' of the Exchange's rules will be available with respect to the assessment of the proposed fees. Under those procedures, a member may seek verification of fees charged by the Exchange. If the member is not satisfied with the verification of fees, he may request a hearing before a panel of three or more members of the Exchange's Appeals Committee. At the hearing the appellant may be represented by counsel and may cross examine witnesses. 5 4 Under CBOE Rule 24.17(b)(v), the OFPC may bar, restrict, or condition a joint account's participation in RAES if any member fails to meet the OEX market maker requirements. Under CBOE Rule 24.17(c)(vi), the OFPC may bar, restrict, or condition a member organization's participation in RAES if any nominee on RAES in OEX fails to meet the OEX market maker requirements. CBOE Rule 24.17(e)(ii) provides several sanctions for failures to comply with the requirements of CBOE Rule 24.17, including disciplinary action under, among others, CBOE Rule 6.20, ``Admission to and Conduct on the Trading Floor,'' and Chapter XVII, ``Discipline,'' of the CBOE's rules. In addition, the OFPC may take remedial action, including suspension of a member's eligibility for participation on RAES and other remedies appropriate under Chapter VIII, ``Market Makers, Trading Crowds, and Modified Trading Systems,'' of the CBOE's rules. 5 See CBOE Rules 19.3, ``Procedure Following Applications for Hearing,'' and 19.4, ``Hearing.'' In addition, the decision of the Exchange's Appeals Committee panel is subject to review by the Board of Directors of the Exchange on the Board's own motion, on the written request of the appellant, or at the request of the Exchange's President or the relevant Exchange Committee Chairman. The review must be conducted by the Board or by a Board Committee consisting of at least three Directors (other than Directors who sat on the Appeals Committee in the matter). An appellant has an opportunity to address issues raided specifically by the Board or the Committee, and in addition may submit oral or written arguments if the Board so allows in its discretion. 6 6 See CBOE Rule 19.5, ``Review.'' The Exchange believes that the proposed fee schedule is appropriate and equitable given the additional requirements imposed on participants in OEX RAES in the RAES Approval Order. Furthermore, to ensure that all members are treated alike under the RAES Approval Order, the Exchange will apply the revised fee schedule retroactively from April 30, 1993, the effective date of the RAES Approval Order. 7 7 By an Exchange Bulletin dated May 11, 1994, the CBOE notified its members of the proposed reduction in the fees due for failures to comply with the log-on and log-off requirements of CBOE Rule 24.17 and the retroactive application of the reduced fees. The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers the objectives of Sections 6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to allocate reasonable dues, fees and charges among CBOE members and to promote the efficiency and effectiveness of the CBOE's automatic execution system. The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b)(5). 8 The Commission believes that the elimination of the automatic disqualification provisions of CBOE Rule 24.17, the introduction of a graduated fee schedule for failures to comply with the RAES log-on and log-off requirements, and the provision allowing individuals to apply to the OFPC for prospective relief from the requirement to log onto RAES on the business day immediately prior to expiration are designed to make the rules applicable to OEX RAES participation fairer and more flexible while maintaining the integrity of the RAES system for OEX options. The proposal is designed to ensure that there is adequate market maker participation at all times in OEX RAES and that market makers are properly logged onto the system. The presence of an adequate number of market makers protects investors and contributes to the maintenance of fair and orderly markets by helping the Exchange to maintain the continued availability to RAES for OEX, thereby contributing to the effective and efficient execution of public investor orders at the best available prices. 8 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1982).
