Yeltsin's Press Secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov made the statement soon after Boris Fyodorov, a major reformer in the cabinet, resigned as finance minister with a warning of economic collapse and social unrest. In an interview with the ITAR-TASS news agency, Kostikov said that Yeltsin will watch closely any changes taking place in the government. Once President Yeltsin finds any divergence from reform in the work of the new cabinet, he will stop it with his constitutional powers, Kostikov noted.
