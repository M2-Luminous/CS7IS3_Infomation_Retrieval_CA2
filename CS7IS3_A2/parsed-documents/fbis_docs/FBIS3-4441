Although close neighbours in Asia, China and ROK remained distant from each other over four decades for complicated historical reasons. When the two regional powers agreed to open diplomatic links in 1992, the world responded with great enthusiasm. The international community believed that the establishment of Sino-ROK ties has closed another chapter of Cold War hostility and paved the way for regional prosperity. World affairs observers noted that it has also had a positive impact on peace and stability in Northeast Asia. On the part of China and ROK, the new relationship has started an era of contacts and opened wide prospects for co-operation between the two countries, especially in trade and investment. Present Sino-ROK relations can be characterized by steady growth, frequent exchange of visits at all levels and substantive two-way trade. Following the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two nations, a host of top ROK officials toured China. Only one month into the new era, then ROK President No Tae-u made an historic visit to Beijing. The latest senior ROK official in China was Yi Man-sop, speaker of the National Assembly, who visited Beijing earlier this year as the guest of China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee. In return, senior Chinese leaders also have paid official visits to Seoul. They included Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Vice-Premier Li Lanqing and Tian Jiyun, Vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee. Leaders of the two countries believe that friendly Sino-ROK relations have suited the fundamental interests of the two peoples and could also help peace and stability in Northeast Asia and the continent at large. Apparent political significance aside, China and ROK benefit a great deal from their fresh ties in terms of trade. When Vice-Premier Li Lanqing toured Seoul last year, ROK President Kim Yong-sam told him that the two countries have complementary economies and their co-operation has great potential. Kim's view has been shared by Li and other senior Chinese. leaders. Increasingly, ROK is betting its economic future on China's booming market as they become two of Asia's most crucial trading partners. China has emerged as ROK's third-largest trading partner after the United States and Japan, with their trade doubling last year to $8.3 billion. Analysts predict the volume will grow 33.2 percent annually, to $28 billion by 1997. Presently, Sino-ROK co-operation is expanding from trade links into investment and technical fields. China is the top counts for investment among many ROK firms. Accumulated investment in China is expected to quadruple from $1 billion, on an approval basis, at the end of 1993 to $4 billion by 1997. A researcher with a top Seoul think-tank was recently quoted as saying that China is an opportunity for ROK, which faces increasing difficulties abroad, caught in between advanced and developing nations. Kim Yong-sam's visit, which began on Saturday, is seen as an opportunity to invigorate industrial ties between the two economies. Leaders of the two countries have expressed their satisfaction over growing relations between Beijing and Seoul. They agreed to build stronger links, in particular closer trade and economic ties. When No Tae-u was in Beijing, the two governments signed a package of agreements on the promotion of bilateral trade and the protection of investment. The agreements served as a solid legal foundation for further growth in bilateral co-operations. When Kim is in town this time, another major investment protection document, on avoidance of double taxation, is expected to be hammered down.
