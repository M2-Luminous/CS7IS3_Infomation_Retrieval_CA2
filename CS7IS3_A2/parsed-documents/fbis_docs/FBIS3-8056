He discussed many domestic and foreign policy issues. We have selected the most important questions and answers. J. Moravcik said the following in connection with our image abroad: "Foreign countries are monitoring our situation very carefully, and one thing is becoming clear to them from our domestic political situation--a trend toward the introduction of certain elements of an authoritarian regime. This is one negative factor. If this were confirmed--and I have the impression that current political developments are confirming these forecasts--we would thus create for ourselves an unfavorable position for our integration into Europe. Another factor is the quite frequent ambiguity of the statements made by certain politicians, first and foremost of whom is the prime minister. This all creates a less than perfect image for the "legibility" of our domestic policy. This, of course, in turn also influences the conclusions that foreign countries come to as far as their relations with our country are concerned." [Question] Mr. Minister, you have said that you do not want to cause any problems for the president by your resignation--that is, problems with regard to relations between the government and the Castle. Could you expand on this? [Moravcik] I was mainly emphasizing that it is necessary to deal speedily with the issue of appointing a new minister. This is in the interest of the Slovak Republic, which I consider to be the most important thing. It is not expedient, within the framework of Slovakia's foreign policy interests, to prolong such a state of uncertainty. So, this was my main reason for submitting my resignation. [Question] It seems to me that the Slovak foreign minister is viewed as follows: Either he is good but not loyal, or he is loyal but not good. Do you think Slovakia needs a good foreign minister or a loyal one? [Moravcik] I think Slovakia needs a minister who is, despite everything, capable of asserting the Republic's foreign policy interests, interests that are specified objectively and geopolitically. There is sufficient support for this in parliament; our foreign policy line was formulated with the participation of all of the political entities. The foreign minister should respect this and he should assert this line. [Question] In this case, must he end up like Milan Knazko and you? [Moravcik] It is necessary to create the domestic political conditions so that this does not happen. I feel that we are going through a period in which the domestic political situation is preventing us, to a broad extent, from implementing our foreign policy interests. [Question] Could you explain why the visit to Bratislava by your Russian counterpart, Andrey Kozyrev, has twice been postponed? [Moravcik] The two sides agreed that they would portray the postponement of this visit as a mutual decision. [Question] Will you be able to give us more details when you are no longer in office? [Moravcik] I must respect Slovakia's interests abroad, even when I am no longer foreign minister. [SMENA correspondent] In reply to a question on the future orientation of Slovak foreign policy, Minister Moravcik said the following: "The orientation of our foreign policy evolved on the basis of a general consensus; it has support in parliament. If someone were to want to alter it, he would obviously meet with resistance in parliament. For this reason, I think that the fundamental line of our foreign policy should and will be maintained." [Question] Andreas Kohl, general secretary of the European Democratic Union, has said that holding a referendum on the withdrawal of mandates from deputies in parliament is at variance with all norms and democratic criteria and incompatible with Slovakia's membership in the Council of Europe. In your opinion, what could the real repercussions of this situation be? [Moravcik] I agree with this assessment; this would really be a considerable step backward. The principle proposed in the referendum is incompatible with the political thinking in democratic Europe and is incompatible with the parliamentarianism that has evolved in Europe over several centuries. This is a well tried system, and such an element, if we were to introduce it, would mean its destruction. [Question] So you think it is possible that Slovakia could be expelled from the Council of Europe? [Moravcik] I think it is likely that this would be discussed. [Question] Mr. Minister, in your opinion, is the nonappointment of ambassadors in key Slovak embassies the fault of the Foreign Ministry or were the "brakes applied," in this context, outside the ministry? [Moravcik] This is a very complicated situation. If the ministry itself had decided on the appointment of ambassadors, all of the posts would have been filled long ago. However, a consensus among three entities--the Foreign Ministry, the government, and the president--is necessary for this. [Question] Where did it get "tied up" most? [Moravcik] It is a very long way from the ministry to the president. [Question] Mr. Minister, you are obviously thinking about establishing a new political entity. In this context, I would like to ask you whether an alliance with--I will say this very pejoratively--the so-called turncoats from the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia and the Slovak National Party is possible. [Moravcik] We will try to consolidate all of the forces oriented toward the center of the political spectrum, including Cernak's National Democratic Party and the Alliance of Slovak Democrats, and, as the case may be, we will also seek other entities. We are thinking about a possible coalition, not a merger, with the social democrats, under the condition that they progress more to the center of the political spectrum. That is the basis. In addition, we will also look for other ways of involving, if possible, some important personalities in political life, people who have such an inclination. I think that a strong center bloc could provide the basis for domestic political stability in Slovakia. [Question] You say "we." Can you tell us who this is? [Moravcik] Those of us who came up with the Alternative for Political Realism initiative are keeping in touch. [Question] Would you like to go into the elections as a bloc with these entities? [Moravcik] It would be ideal if a common entity were to come into being and if a merger were to take place. If this does not happen, we would consider it effective and expedient, at least, to form such a bloc, which means an electoral coalition. [Question] Classified material was discussed at a government session a few weeks ago. It was submitted by Deputy Prime Minister Sergej Kozlik, and, according to some reports from the lobbies, it dealt with Slovakia's geopolitical position. Could you be more specific about this material? [Moravcik] It is classified material, which means I cannot make public its contents; however, I can venture to express an opinion on it. It is so naive and imperfect that it cannot be utilized. It is muddled, and, in my opinion, there is no point in discussing it.
