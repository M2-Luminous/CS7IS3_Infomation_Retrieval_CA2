These were the words used by a senior PRC official speaking about the numerical targets demanded of Japan by the United States in the Japan-U.S. economic consultations. The Chinese official was speaking at a high-level working-level meeting held between the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] and the PRC State Economic and Trade Commission at the MITI for two days up to 26 April. The official supported Japan's position in the economic consultations, saying--as if citing from a textbook on capitalism--"It is the market which decides which products are sold in what quantities." He also spoke about the U.S. stand of attaching human rights questions to the issue of extending most-favored-nation [MFN] status [to China], and he criticized the United States, insisting, "It would be meaningless if the United States were to impose its way of doing things on us." Japan avoided making any comment on the U.S. human rights diplomacy, but a top MITI official who has borne the brunt of criticism from the United States [in the economic consultations] for so long looked very pleased by this unexpected friendly "yell" from China. He said, "There is an expression: One million troops have arrived to help us. I felt as though I had 1.2 billion troops who had arrived to help us."
