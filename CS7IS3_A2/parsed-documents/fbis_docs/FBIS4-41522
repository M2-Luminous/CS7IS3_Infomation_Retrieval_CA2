President Nazarbayev attended on 22 June. Judging by the number of foreign companies displaying their goods here, we can say that a great number of businessmen are willing to cooperate with Kazakhstan and set up joint ventures with it. This is what President Nazarbayev said during his conversation with Shaffer, a representative of the German Ministry of Agriculture, after he familiarized himself with that country's equipment. We are willing to manufacture all of them jointly with German companies. This is a beneficial area for cooperation and we have agreed to develop it with Chancellor Kohl. [words indistinct] a basis has been created for setting up several Kazakhstan-German joint ventures. In particular, everything is ready for starting the joint production of the "Class"-type combines in Akmola, beet-lifters, machinery for pressing and mowing grass, cleaning and grading grain, and pre-sowing soil cultivation. They have been highly appraised by farmers and experts from Kazakhstan's center for testing machinery. Relevant government agreements are available, [words indistinct] technical documentation has been compiled and buildings have been found. Germany has allocated the "Hermes" special credit line. Unfortunately, we can't use it now, since the Alem-Bank despite [words indistinct] hasn't provided us with guarantees for the efficient use of the credit and timely return of it. It looks like serious financial decisions have to be taken here. But we should take them, Nazarbayev said, and as soon as possible. This will allow us to start promising new products. "Why is it important for us to have joint ventures," the president asked. "Because we have a good basis for this. There is a great demand for highly efficient agricultural machinery. We have metal for it. At the initial stage we will have to purchase parts and units but later on we will be able to master their production and create powerful industrial complexes. [words indistinct] one of the directions followed by the civilzed world." [passage omitted] The president showed interest in the technology by leading companies of the world used in the protection of plants and processment of agricultural produce, higly efficient equipment which could be used in food industry and laboratory equipment for checking its quality. He also familiarized himself with the latest achievements in telecommunications, and electronic and power engineering systems of communications, which are being displayed by businessmen from 16 countries of the world at the "Atakent" business center.
