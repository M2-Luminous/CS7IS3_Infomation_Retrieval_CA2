General P. Grachev, Russian Federation defense minister, had also visited Volga Military District units a little earlier. The following question arises: What kind of "peacekeeping" missions do the U.S. 3d Infantry and Russian 27th Divisions intend to solve jointly? Bloody conflicts began on many republics' territories following the Soviet Union's disbandment. The Russian economy and the economies of other states formed on USSR territory ended up in a catastrophic situation. It is also alarming that the country's defense potential, created by the Soviet people's intensive labor, has been lost to a considerable extent. Meanwhile NATO countries headed by the United States are cynically flexing their military muscles. They launched missile and bomb attacks on the Iraqi people, they are issuing ultimatums to Cuba, the DPRK, and our fraternal Serbian people, they are shooting down aircraft in the Bosnian skies, and they are threatening to bomb Serb positions. It is painful for working people of the Orenburg and Volga regions, like all Russians, to see the country's military and economic might and political authority declining in the course of reforms directed against the people. The increasing peremptoriness with which Western powers are openly interfering in Russia's internal affairs is a cause of anger and indignation to us. The Orenburg region is turning into a kind of communal yard and a dumping ground for Western enterprises' harmful waste. Israeli, French, and Dutch enterprises have sent around 20 cars to the oblast loaded with industrial waste which is dangerous to people's health. While the authorities can reconcile themselves to such shameful phenomena, we have no intention of doing so. Sociopolitical organizations in the Orenburg and Volga regions strongly protest against the attempt to hold military exercises involving the U.S. Army in a strategically important region of Russia where the defense industry is densely concentrated and which is the people's breadbasket. We demand that the Russian Federation president and Government cancel the Defense Ministry's plans to hold exercises on southern Urals territory. We call on the State Duma to protect working people's fundamental interests and our oblasts' peaceful life. We call on all honest patriots in the Urals and Volga region republics and oblasts to raise their voices in defense of our country's sovereignty. U.S troops have no business on our soil!
