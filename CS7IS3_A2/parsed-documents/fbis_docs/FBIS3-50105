On this occasion he informed his hosts of the current political situation in the Srpska republic. Here is a dispatch by Novi Sad Television: [Begin recording] [Reporter Mileva Tomic] The present moment in the resolution of the crisis in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina is being marked by a unique absurdity, namely, by the Muslim side rejecting the realization of its own proposal, President of the Srpska republic Radovan Karadzic emphasized when he was explaining the stance of the Serbian delegation at the peace talks. [Karadzic] Now we will probably revoke all these proposals. In our pocket we have a new platform [word indistinct] for a modus vivendi in (?which we shall depart from the factual situation). The factual situation is the borders of the Srpska republic. They can only be changed through agreement. The one who attacks us should receive a fitting reply in accordance with the rules of international military law. This is one of the possibilities by which we might recall everything that the Muslims have gained from us as a sort of concessions. [Tomic] Speaking of the long-term goals of the Serbian people on the territory of former Yugoslavia, Radovan Karadzic singled out the need for unity and responsible analysis of joint interests as the only way of their realization. [Karadzic] I must say that it has always been a great concern of ours and that, regardless of what we do, we also think of the Serbian Krajina. [Serbian President] Milosevic, myself, and my delegation (?have concluded) that it would be the best to accept the opening of a bureau of the Republic of Croatia in Belgrade, as this would in no way impair Krajina's interests, because the bureau of the republic of Serbian Krajina and the bureau of the Srpska republic already exist in Belgrade. With the bureau of the Republic of Croatia, Croatia is now being brought to a completely equal footing with Krajina and the Srpska republic; therefore, it did not get any more than the Serbian Krajina got. The other thing that we have achieved is that Croatia's drawing nearer to the Serbs has de-vilified Serbia. Serbia is no longer an aggressor, a demon, and so forth, and here we have benefited much more than [Croatian President] Tudjman. [Tomic] The Srpska republic is a real country, Karadzic said, disorganized as much as any other country in conditions of war, but with a clear goal and generally acceptable methods for the creation of a free and democratic community of the Serbian people.
