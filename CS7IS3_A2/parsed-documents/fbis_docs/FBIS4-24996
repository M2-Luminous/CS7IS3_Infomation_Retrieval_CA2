Scattered in nearly 50 countries and regions, these enterprises have expanded exports and obtained a great deal of overseas market information for the province. At the beginning of the 1980s, some foreign trade companies first opened overseas agencies. Entering the 1990s, the province made a number of favorable policies to encourage the industrial companies to set up overseas agencies. By now, many large enterprises, in the fields of chemicals, textiles, metallurgy, machinery, aquatic products and medicines, began to set up overseas agencies. The production enterprises make up 50 percent of the total overseas agencies. These overseas agencies not only undertake trading, investment, information service, labor export, but also pool overseas capital to the province. By establishing overseas branches and opening the international market, some giant enterprises of the province have become trans- national enterprise groups.
