And it is not only restricted to government and Party officials-- shortcomings within the economic system have also encouraged others to resort to dishonesty. In order to stamp out corruption, the country's economic and managerial systems should be restructured. This is more effective than launching moral crusades. Government and military departments should be banned from running businesses. They should have their administrations streamlined and their staff should be paid higher wages. And banks should not be made to impose loan quotas and discriminatory interest rates on private businesses. Instead, their criteria for lending should be based on the performance of the debtor. And the government should see to it that all businesses, regardless of their ownership and organization, compete on an equal footing. They should have equal access to foreign exchange, foreign trade rights and other resources. The dual pricing system which exists for certain raw materials, capital and labour at the moment invites abuse of the system. The government's protection of some businesses, the monopoly status it grants to some industries, its excessive customs tariffs and import quotas and its preferential treatment of certain departments and regions, have all aided unfair competition and led to corruption. The absence of a sound legal system and a lack of checks and balances within the government have also furthered corruption. For a while malpractices were checked, only to raise their heads again once the pressure was off. The most effective anticorruption drive would be a gradual reform of the unfair allocation system. Capital is the most important element in any society. Until now, the government has secured a low interest rate for State-owned enterprises while adopting a much higher, market-dictated interest rate for the private sector. In addition to this, the government has adopted a loan quota system to guarantee loans for state-run firms. As a result some banks demand bribes from private companies that are eager for a loan. The government should unify interest rates and float them so that they are set by market demand. It needs to allow non-State and foreign banks to compete in the financial market and at the same time it should subsidize loans for such sectors as agriculture, communications and energy production. To ensure fair competition, the government should also slash tariffs, cancel the monopoly status it has given to import-export firms, lift controls on foreign exchange and reduce the restrictions on foreign businesses involved in the service industry. Except in the case of a few essential public services such as electricity, water and gas supplies, postal services and military production, there is little reason for retaining government monopolies. Moreover, the government should break down all regional trade barriers to ensure the free flow of resources and it should abolish preferential tax reductions. The existing salary levels for government officials don't help. Civil servants with high political positions often only enjoy low economic status. The sense of not being paid for what they do leads many bureaucrats to run their own businesses or exchange favours for bribes. If the size of the present administration is cut by one-third, the salary of bureaucrats should be raised to at least that of the average worker. Meanwhile, housing, medical and transport subsidies for officials should be abolished and their gross incomes should be made public. The government is also not spending enough on defence. To make up the shortfall, the Chinese army is now engaging in business activities to make money. Some of which have led to corruption. For the long-term stability of the country, the government should increase its military spending substantially to ensure that the income of soldiers and officers is higher than that of the national average.
