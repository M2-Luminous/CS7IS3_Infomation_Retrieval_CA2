What is the Jordanian concept of this relationship? [Al-Majali] First, we must reiterate the existence of a special and distinguished relationship between Jordan and the Palestinian brothers for many old, present, and future reasons. We support the PLO, the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, and do not interfere in its internal affairs. We also hope it will not interfere in our internal affairs. We will deal with it the same way we deal with a friend, dear neighbor, and honorable brother. Therefore, we wish it all success. We believe that it has achieved an advanced step, and hope it will succeed in achieving other steps. We also hope the Palestinian people will achieve their genuine right to self-determination. We also believe that once the Palestinian people have achieved this right, they will freely call for establishing a special kind of relationship with Jordan. Things will then be addressed in an appropriate way. [Al-Hisban] A new reality has been established on the popular level. There are Palestinians and there are Jordanians. Who is the Jordanian and who is the Palestinian in light of this new reality? [Al-Majali] The people who carry Jordanian citizenship and believe in the Jordanian system and state are Jordanians. This is our Constitution and this is justice. There is no difference between a person from a Palestinian or non-Palestinian origin. The important thing is that the one who carries Jordanian citizenship and believes in the country is considered a Jordanian. [Al-Hisban] Will those who carry the five-year passports be given the freedom to make their choice? [Al-Majali] Of course. They are Jordanians, and no force on earth can tell them otherwise. However, those people have the right to choose another citizenship. We all know that the rights that were given to the refugees who came to Jordan were in fact a trust to enable them regain their rights and lands. [Al-Hisban] What about those who carry two-year temporary passports? [Al-Majali] As you know, these are temporary passports that were issued to serve the Palestinian brothers who were living in the West Bank at a certain time or the West Bankers who were living outside the West Bank. Those people were issued these passports to facilitate their work and make life easier for them. Regarding those people, if the PLO or the Palestinian authority decide to issue passports I believe they will be issued passports and their issue will be resolved. [Al-Hisban] In light of the recent bridge measures, the Jordanian interior minister said that the danger of displacement has ended. Do you believe that this danger has really ended? [Al-Majali] I believe so, particularly since the situation inside the occupied territory has become different. The displacement is either by force or voluntarily. Now that a Palestinian entity has been established, the brothers who will be living in this entity will not be subject to the pressures to which they were exposed in the past. Furthermore, the occupied territory should enjoy a very good economic situation. So, why would they emigrate? I believe that all causes of emigration will end. So, why should we fear its continuation? The measures that were taken came in light of the change that took place on the ground. These measures aim at facilitating the movement of our brother from one side to another. [Al-Hisban] Concerning the issue of displacement, the Lebanese proposed a plan to solve the problem of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. I believe this plan is based on settling 20 percent [in Lebanon], returning 20 percent [to the occupied territory], and displacing 60 percent. It has also been reported that a percentage of those displaced will be settled in Jordan. [Al-Majali] I have never heard of such a thing. If there are proposals to this effect, I do not believe it is a matter of 20 percent or any other percentage. The issue of refugees must be resolved within an international framework. Jordan is the country that hosts the largest number of refugees. So, is it reasonable to increase their number here, particularly since Jordan's resources are limited? This is not logical. We cannot speak about this before deciding the issue of refugees within the multilateral and bilateral talks. [Al-Hisban] Has Nabih Birri, speaker of the Lebanese Chamber of Deputies, presented any ideas in this regard? [Al-Majali] Not at all. He has proposed nothing, because there is nothing between Jordan and Lebanon with regard to the issue of refugees. The press, however, is fabricating stories on this issue. This is a Lebanese and Palestinian matter. Jordan has nothing to do with it. [Al-Hisban] It has been reported that the Jordanian-Palestinian economic agreement has been obstructed because of some points in it. Do you believe this is caused by the Palestinian-Israeli economic agreement? [Al-Majali] Those points were addressed following the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. There was an agreement on most of the points, in fact, on all of them. Following the agreement, the Palestinian side asked for more time to discuss two points and then to respond to them. We hope this will take place as soon as possible. [Al-Hisban] So far, how do you appraise what has been reached with the Palestinian side? [Al-Majali] What has been achieved is good, responsible, and promising. We must realize that the brothers do not have full freedom to act in the economic arena. This is a transitional, not a final, phase. In the final phase, we will talk with the Palestinian brothers on different issues. We will hold talks with the Palestinian brothers and the Israelis on the economic issues that concern the three parties. We should wait to see what will happen in the future. [Al-Hisban] Regarding inter-Arab relations, you proposed a rescheduling of Arab differences. What is new in this regard? [Al-Majali] We hope for this. It would be better if we could put our differences aside and cooperate to end the bloodshed in Yemen. Is this issue not worth an Arab meeting? Therefore, I reiterate that the only way is to reschedule our differences. We do not deny the existence of differences, however, the present time is not a suitable one to talk about them. We can say that there are no differences over 99 percent of the issues. So, why do we not stick to these points and close ranks to face the current challenges in the region? I believe that the best thing is to agree that there are differences, but the solution should come after three to four years. Meanwhile, we should continue cooperation. [Al-Hisban] Some analyses indicate that Jordan has been somewhat isolated due to many intransigent positions toward it? [Al-Majali] It is rather the opposite. Except for two brothers with whom some estrangement still exists, all other Arab states are enjoying a good deal of amity. These two brothers believe that differences should be resolved now. We are ready for this but the circumstances are not opportune, and we can postpone discussing our differences and document what has been agreed. [Al-Hisban] What about the siege of al-'Aqabah? [Al-Majali] It is almost over, and is in its final stages. [Al-Hisban] It is said, however, that there are differences over who will pay the costs? [Al-Majali] The costs will be paid by the parties concerned, and there is a special fund to compensate for all repercussions of the Gulf war. Cash, however, is not available, so Jordan is entitled to retrieve the costs it may have paid. [Al-Hisban] It was said that bilateral negotiations will resume at the end of April. We are now at the end of May, and they have not yet resumed? [Al-Majali] As you know, the negotiations were suspended due to the Hebron events, after which a Palestinian-Israeli agreement was signed. There are now attempts to activate the Syrian track in one way or another through U.S. mediation. If we are invited once the simple points with the brothers in Syria are resolved, we will proceed forward. [Al-Hisban] There are rumors about a reshuffle in your cabinet? [Al-Majali] Each cabinet reconsiders its formation and tries to renew itself. This is a routine matter. At this time, however, there is no reshuffle. [Al-Hisban] The [Government's] relationship with the House of Representatives saw some tension at first. Afterward, it became stable, but, apparently, some tension has surfaced again? [Al-Majali] There is no tension between us and the deputies. Naturally, the House of Representatives is a new house and most of it consists of friends who have their own attitudes. However, they are, in one way or another, unfamiliar with the issue of representation. Thus, it is natural for such things to happen in the first round of sessions. However, with the passage of time, everyone would be convinced that all are working for the public interest. Convergence is the predominant feature. But if we search for differences and conflicts, we can find them. Likewise, if we search for convergence, we can find it. In fact, there was no conflict. There is another viewpoint, and this usually happens. We do not expect the deputies to accept everything the Government submits. If they do so, the House would no longer be necessary. [Al-Hisban] Your cabinet raised the idea of a separation among the branches of authority. Is this principle still valid? [Al-Majali] I believe this is a principle. His Majesty King Husayn has frequently referred to it. Separation of powers is a basic issue, so no branch will encroach on another in any way whatsoever. This, however, does not at all mean that a deputy is prohibited from being a minister. There is no decision that this matter is absolutely banned. [Al-Hisban] King Husayn has criticized the Jordanian media, however, no radical changes have thus far happened. [Al-Majali] Do the ones who demand a radical change believe that such a change should be made in the people or in the policies? [Al-Hisban] I believe the change should be made in policies. [Al-Majali] The policy exists and it is clear but those who carry it out are human beings and sometimes make mistakes. We want the highest level of performance, but our potential is limited. [Al-Hisban] Let us return to the issue of negotiations. Is there any comprehensive solution to what is taking place in the arena? [Al-Majali] Every one talks about and believes in a comprehensive solution, but also agrees that progress differs from one track to another because each track has its own circumstances. The Palestinian track has only managed to secure a document covering the first period. In other words, the Palestinian track began late, at a point from where we started two years ago. Can we say that it moved alone? The answer is no, because its problems and issues are different. In light of the agenda, we could have made rapid progress, but when we felt that other sides slowed down their moves, we stopped for a while. The same applies to the Syrian and Lebanese brothers. Coordination exists, and we all believe in the comprehensive solution. There are no unilateral moves, and we are coordinating with each other because it is in the interest of everybody to reach a comprehensive solution. [Al-Hisban] Following the recent measures on the bridges and the recent visits to Jordan by several delegations, several semi-official Palestinian statements indicated that Jordan was clearing the way to retreat from its disengagement decision in one way or another. [Al-Majali] The disengagement took place, the entity has been established, and retreat from disengagement is not considered at all. Whether we want it or not, the issue is out of the question. The entity has been established, the Palestinian police have entered, and an agreement was signed with Israel. Despite all this, some people say Jordan wants to retreat from its disengagement decision. Of course, those who do not like Jordanian-Palestinian detente and those who want to fish in murky water and create problems are spreading such ideas. But Jordan does all it can for the Palestinian brothers. Regarding the delegations, you know that His Majesty King Husayn was distressed by the tragic loss of the Queen Mother, and these delegations came just to extend their condolences. How can we explain feelings in light of politics? [Al-Hisban] You promised to increase salaries after the endorsement of the sales tax law. The law has been endorsed. Is there any plan for such an increase? [Al-Majali] We wanted to reach a radical solution to the conditions of government employees, but this needs enough money, which is not available. However, there will be a solution that will improve their conditions, but not a radical one. [Al-Hisban] One year after the formation of your government, what are your major accomplishments in which you can take pride? [Al-Majali] I cannot talk about my accomplishments and those of may government. Everybody believes his accomplishments to be the best. It is you who should talk about what you see.
