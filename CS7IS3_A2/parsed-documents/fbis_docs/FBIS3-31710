The policemen tried to take the boat into Piran Bay, however, its captain, 28-year-old Zvonko Vincekovic from Opatija, resisted this. For this reason the trawl was dropped into the sea and the boat was taken to Piran by force. The policemen decided to impound the Croatian ship and prosecute the captain. The Croatian fishing boat probably trawled for the first time as there was no catch on the deck. This morning a Piran magistrate judge levied a 70,000-tolar fine upon Vincekovic, which he refused to pay. The boat is thus still anchored in Piran Bay. This incident, the second this year, took place on exactly the same spot as the incident from a month ago that was deemed hushed up. Namely, on that occasion policemen released the offender; however, on this occasion they acted in accordance with the Fishing Law.
