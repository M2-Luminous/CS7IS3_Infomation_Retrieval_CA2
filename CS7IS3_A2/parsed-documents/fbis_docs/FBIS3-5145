Yanbian Shipping Co. is negotiating with the South Korean Government via its Seoul agent, Korea Special Shipping Co., about its plans to have a 499-ton container ship sail between South Korea's Pusan and North Korea's Chongjin once a week. Foreign ships operating irregularly between North and South Korea now carry goods as there is no regular shipping service linking the two. If the route is opened, the Chinese shipping firm will use it to transport goods chiefly between South Korea and Yanbian, rather than between the two Koreas, as there are rail links between Chongjin and Yanbian, the sources said. An official of the Korea Maritime and Port Administration said his office had not yet received an application for opening a sea route between Pusan and Chongjin from the shipper. "When we receive the application, we'll decide on it after consulting with related government ministries," he added.
