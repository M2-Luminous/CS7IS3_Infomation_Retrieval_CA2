If members of parliament were informed of every plan and process of Czech intelligence and counter-intelligence there would immediately be leaks to the media, he warned. Parliament could only control the Czech services' activites by appointing reliable individuals to top posts, he said. Members of the parliamentary inspection commission would be able, he said, to look at the files of closed cases but not cases currently in operation. He said recent German press reports that many secret agents of former communist countries, including the Czech Republic, are still operating in Germany were "slightly coloured" by the fact that German agents who used to operate in communist states are now afraid of losing their jobs. Information CTK obtained from deputies close to the Parliamentary Defence and Security Committee suggests, however, that parliament can only inspect the activities of one of the four Czech intelligence services, the Security Information Service (BIS) which conducts counter-intelligence within the Czech Republic. The other services engage in espionage abroad, military intelligence and military counter-intelligence. Speaking on the same television programme he said that the state should contribute substantially to the funding of political parties. If it did not do so, there was a risk the financing might become criminal. He explained the delays in passing the law on party funding as being due to certain concrete questions remaining unsolved, for example: who should control the funding and whether parties should be obliged to declare the sources of other funds, like donations.
