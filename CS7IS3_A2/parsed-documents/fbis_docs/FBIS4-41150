Will Konstantin Zatulin Remain Duma Committee Chairman?"] [Text] Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of a State Duma committee, has announced his resignation from the post of senior secretary of the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] faction. Among the many reasons which prompted him to do this he mentioned "the impossibility of collectively formulating, discussing, and implementing party policy in a serious way." In Zatulin's opinion its most serious problem as of today is the question "with whom and against whom the PRES will be in future presidential and parliamentary elections." He expressed his fear in the words of Solzhenitsyn: "There is a risk that the party could remain the Moscow entourage of its ambitious leader and that its members could inherit the lot of hostages in a political game they do not understand." The discord among the faction's leaders has immediately raised the following question point-blank: Will Zatulin continue to head the Committee for CIS Affairs and Ties With Compatriots, or will the PRES try to replace him with a more reliable representative of its own? Faction member Sergey Shulgin, chairman of the Duma subcommittee for tax and customs legislation, prefers to call what has occurred not a split but a redistribution of duties -- Zatulin has been extremely heavily burdened with Duma committee matters. Nevertheless, Shulgin said, "I am surprised by Zatulin's words concerning Sergey Shakhray's 'dictatorial' ways. Rather, it is the author of the reproaches himself who suffers from this. Shakhray is quite a democratic man. When he attends sessions of the faction -- which rarely happens -- he conducts them evenhandedly and properly, taking account of all opinions. If Zatulin does leave the faction, he is not obliged to quit the chairmanship of the State Duma committee. We voted against making deputies' mandates imperative. We should proceed from the premise that Zatulin's nomination may have brought a certain percentage of votes to the PRES in the elections and helped our candidates into parliament." Sergey Shapovalov, chairman of the State Duma Committee for Federation and Regional Policy Affairs, is convinced that it is a question of conflicts over certain political questions which are being decided within the association. The question of whether the PRES representative should hold the chairmanship of the Committee for CIS Affairs and Ties With Compatriots should he leave the deputies' faction is a complex one. The State Duma statute contains no legal rules defining such actions. When we voted en bloc for the chairmen and deputy chairmen of committees, Shapovalov said, we did not envisage such a turn of events. An amendment must now be made, because this problem could arise in other factions as well. "Personally I believe that if a `party' deputy leaves a faction, the faction is entitled to raise in the Duma the question of replacing him with another member of the faction. Otherwise this will destroy the mechanism for pursuing party policy in parliament."
