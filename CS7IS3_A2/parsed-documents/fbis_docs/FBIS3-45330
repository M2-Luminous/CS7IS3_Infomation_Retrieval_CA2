I. To Implement the System of Selling Off Foreign Exchange Receipts to the Banks and Abolish Foreign Exchange Retention System The foreign exchange receipts of all domestic enterprises, public institutions, government agencies, and social organizations in China shall be promptly repatriated. Foreign exchange earnings which fall into the following categories (except those of foreign investment enterprises) shall all be sold off to the designated foreign exchange banks for renminbi based on the exchange rates listed by the banks. 1. Foreign exchange earnings from exports, transit trade and other trading activities; 2. Foreign exchange earnings from services provided by communication and transportation, post and telecommunications, tourism, insurance, and other service industries, and from inter-governmental transfer; 3. Net foreign exchange proceeds from foreign exchange operations of the banks, which are required to be turned over to the State, and foreign exchange returns received from overseas service contracts, and from investment abroad which are subject to repatriation; and 4. Other foreign exchange receipts which are required to be sold off to banks pursuant to the regulations of the exchange control administration. Foreign exchange earnings of the following categories are permitted to be held in foreign exchange in the accounts opened with the designated foreign exchange banks: (1) Foreign exchange remittance to China for the purpose of investment by non-resident legal entities or natural persons; (2) Foreign exchange received from external borrowing, and debt or equity issuance; (3) Funds remitted back to China by the service contracts companies within the contract period of their overseas projects for current use of the project; (4) Receipts from foreign donations and grants approved for specific purposes; (5) Foreign exchange receipts of diplomatic missions, and residence offices of international organizations and other non-resident legal entities in China; and (6) Foreign exchange held by individuals. When payments for domestic expenses occur for the above-mentioned categories of foreign exchange, they should be made in renminbi, which can be exchanged at the designated foreign exchange banks. All such existing foreign exchange allocation systems as foreign exchange retention, compulsory turning-over, and quota control are to be abolished. The current holding of foreign exchange retention quotas, and the outstanding balance of foreign exchange accounts, which is excluded from the above-mentioned categories permitted to be held in foreign exchange, will be dealt with in accordance with the following principles: The holdings of foreign exchange retention quotas will continue to be valid and can be used based on the official renminbi exchange rate published on December 31, 1993. The foreign exchange retention quotas, which are sold off to the banks before the unification of the exchange rates but of which book entry is yet to be completed, shall be entered into the book before January 31, 1994, and are also permitted to use according to the official exchange rate published on December 31,1993. The above-mentioned outstanding balance of foreign exchange accounts, which is excluded from the categories permitted to be held in foreign exchange, may be maintained under the system of selling off all foreign exchange receipts to banks, but for such accounts, only withdrawal is permitted with no more re-deposit until all funds in the accounts are drawn off. The outstanding balance of these foreign exchange accounts can be used for current payments, debt service, and selling off to the banks. II. To Implement the System of Purchasing Foreign Exchange From the Banks and Make the Renminbi Conditionally Convertible Under the Current Account After introducing the system of purchasing foreign exchange from the banks, the existing authorization procedure of allocating foreign exchange according to the State plan for normal external payment items under the current account is to be abolished. Foreign exchange needed by domestic enterprises, public institutions, government agencies, and social organizations for external payments under the current account shall be purchased from the designated foreign exchange banks with renminbi, upon presentation of the following effective documentation and then the banks make the payment for them. 1. Import quota, licence, or other import authorization issued by the departments concerned and relevant import contract for those items subject to import quota or import restrictions; 2. Registration verification and relevant import contract for those items subject to import voluntary registration; 3. Import contract and notification for payment from overseas financial institutions for all other import items than the above two categories, which are in conformity with the State regulations; and 4. Payment agreement or contract and notification for payment from overseas financial and non-financial institutions for commercial payment under the non-trade account. Purchase of foreign exchange for non-commercial payments or for withdrawal of foreign currency in cash shall be proceeded in accordance with the relevant regulations on financial and foreign exchange control. The authorization procedures shall continue to be in effect for foreign exchange remittance for making overseas investment, lending, and donations. As an interim measure the export enterprises, at the initial stage of this reform, can open a record-keeping account over the counter at the designated banks with 50 percent of the total foreign exchange they sell off to the banks. When they need foreign exchange for export operations and other supplementary trading expenses, upon presentation of valid documents as mentioned above, the banks will sell them the foreign exchange and make the payment directly if the transaction amount is not more than the outstanding entitlement as recorded in their record-keeping accounts. For the payment amount exceeding their entitlement, the enterprises may also purchase foreign exchange with renminbi and make the payment at the designated banks, but upon presenting valid documentation in accordance with the relevant State regulations. III. To Establish an Inter-bank Foreign Exchange Market and Improve the Mechanism of Exchange Rate Determination So As To Maintain a Reasonable and Relatively Stable Renminbi Exchange Rate After the introduction of the systems of selling and buying foreign exchange at the banks, a national unified inter-bank foreign exchange market will be established. The designated foreign exchange banks are main participants in the inter-bank market whose main functions are to facilitate the matching of long and short foreign exchange positions of different designated banks, and to provide clearing and settlement service for banks. This market is regulated and supervised by the People's Bank of China through the State Administration of Exchange Control. The dual renminbi exchange rates are to be unified as of January 1, 1994. The unified renminbi exchange rate will become a single, managed floating rate based on market demand and supply of foreign exchange. The People's Bank of China will publish daily the middle rate of renminbi against US dollar according to the transaction price prevailing in the inter-bank foreign exchange market on the previous day, and also, with reference to the changes of the international foreign exchange market, publish the renminbi rates against other major foreign currencies. Based on the foreign exchange rates published by the People's Bank, the designated banks will then list their own exchange rates within the floating range designated by the People's Bank, and purchase or sell foreign exchange to their customers at the listed rates. With the prerequisite of stabilizing the domestic currency, the listed exchange rates of different banks are to be maintained basically compatible and relatively stable through inter-bank foreign exchange trading and the intervention of the People's Bank through buying and selling foreign exchange in the foreign exchange market. IV. To Strengthen the Legitimate Operation and Service Function of the Designated Foreign Exchange Banks The source of renminbi funds needed by the designated banks to conduct foreign exchange trading shall be in principle from the banks' own capital. The State only implements a proportional control over the foreign exchange working funds held by the designated banks, the proportional ratios of each designated bank are to be determined by the People's Bank based on the size of its foreign exchange assets and total turnovers in foreign exchange settlement. If the foreign exchange working capital holdings of a designated bank exceed the ceiling of its designated ratio, it must sell the excess to other designated banks or the People's Bank, if its holdings drop to a level less than the low limit of the designated ratio, it must buy enough foreign exchange promptly from other designated banks or the People's Bank to supplement its holdings. In order to allow their customers with forward payment contracts or debt repayment agreements to be protected from the exchange rate risk, the designated banks may conduct renminbi hedging business against foreign currencies for their customers when the valid documents are presented. All designated banks shall maintain a rational assets and liabilities structure, and conduct such business activities as foreign exchange buying and selling, establishment of accounts, deposit-taking, and loan-making in accordance with the relevant regulations. The banks are expected to strive for high quality in customer service, low level of service charges, legitimacy in business conduct, and honesty in competition. V. Reinforcing the External Debts Administration and Establishing a Debt Redemption Fund So As To Safeguard China's International Credibility China will continue its current practice of managing external borrowing and repayment by centralized planning, financial authorization, and debt registration. All guarantees issued for borrowing incurred by nonresident legal entities (including those overseas institutions and enterprises controlled by Chinese domestic capitals) shall be in rigorous pursuance to the Requirements of Providing Foreign Exchange Guaranty by Domestic Institutions which was promulgated by the State Administration of Exchange Control. In order to maintain the international credibility of our country, the control over the repayment of external debts is to be reinforced so as to continue with the principle that repayment should be made by those who incur the debts. Borrowers are required to intensify the management of those projects financed by external debts in order to improve the economic efficiency and capability of foreign exchange earnings of the projects. The State encourages and supports those local authorities, departments concerned, and heavily indebted enterprises to establish redemption funds in proportion to their total debt outstanding. Such redemption funds are permitted to be deposited in the special foreign exchange accounts opened with designated foreign exchange banks. Foreign exchange receipts from designated exports specially authorized by the State and earmarked for debt repayments can be credited directly to the special accounts. Funds in such special accounts may only be used for external debt service, and are forbidden to be transferred or used for other payments. The debt service payments shall be made from borrower's special accounts opened for redemption funds. If borrowers are inflicted with repayment difficulties, subject to review and authorization by the foreign exchange control administration, they may purchase foreign exchange with renminbi at the designated foreign exchange banks, upon presenting certificates of debt registration and debt service authorization in accordance with the borrowing agreement, so as to make the repayment. In the case that the borrowers intend to make the repayment prior to the maturity date as provided by in the borrowing agreements, such repayment is subject to the approval of the foreign exchange control administration according to the relevant regulations. No bank is permitted to make repayment transactions without proper authorization for those unregistered external obligations, or for those obligations incurred by unauthorized issuance of debt guarantees to non-resident legal entities by the domestic institutions. As for those foreign exchange loans made by domestic financial institutions, repayments may be made by borrowers directly from their foreign exchange receipts, or with the foreign exchange that they purchase using renminbi at the designated banks pursuant to the loan agreements. Under the new system, loans made by domestic financial institutions using funds from their overseas borrowing and from collecting foreign currency deposits will continue to follow the practice that repayment of foreign exchange loans is to be made in foreign exchange, and the process of repayment are those as described above. VI. To Maintain the Current Foreign Exchange Administration for Enterprises With Foreign Investment The enterprises with foreign investment can still keep their foreign exchange accounts with either the foreign exchange designated banks or foreign banks in China. In cases that the external payments of these enterprises are within the scope authorized by the State regulation, and that it is to service the foreign exchange debts incurred with domestic financial institutions, these enterprises may make the payments from the outstanding balances of their foreign exchange accounts directly. If these enterprises, for the purpose of production, operation, debt service, and profit and dividend remittance, need more foreign exchange than the outstanding balance of their foreign exchange account, after being reviewed and approved by the State foreign exchange administrative departments according to the documents and contracts authorized by the government agencies concerned, they may also purchase foreign exchange from the designated banks. VII. To Cease Domestic Pricing and Settlements in Foreign Currency and Prohibit Foreign Currency Circulation in China As of January 1, 1994, any type of domestic pricing and settlements in foreign currency shall be ceased, and foreign currency circulation and trading of foreign currencies outside of the designated financial institutions shall be totally prohibited. Issuance of foreign exchange certificates (FEC) will also be terminated as of January 1, 1994. But the FEC in circulation continues to be valid, and is to be phased out from circulation gradually. VIII. To Enhance Macroeconomic Management of China's Balance of Payment Work on analyses and projection of changes and trends of China's foreign exchange payment and receipts and its overall balance of payments shall be enhanced in order to gradually complete our macroeconomic control system over the balance of payments. Establishing an efficient and effective balance of payment reporting and statistics system, with a view to strengthening verification, data-collecting, monitoring, and management of foreign exchange receipts and payments, and on foreign borrowing, will facilitate our efforts in blocking up loopholes, and reducing and eliminating eventually the drain on our foreign exchange reserves. All the departments concerned shall work together in a timely and co-ordinated fashion to resolve problems occurring in our work so as to make sure that the forthcoming foreign exchange system reform is implemented smoothly.
