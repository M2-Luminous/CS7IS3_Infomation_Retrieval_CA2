"The fighting was very intense last night," UN military spokesman Jean-Guy Plante told AFP by telephone from Kigali. "There was a lot of heavy mortar and machine-gun fire. It's still going on this morning but it's sporadic." Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) rebels are pressing their offensive to flush remaining government soldiers out of the capital Kigali, apparently fearing that French troops may forestall an all-out victory by the rebels who control about two-thirds of the small central African country. Major Plante said UN troops had established radio contact late Thursday with French forces that arrived in western Rwanda on Thursday in the first stage of a military intervention to stem ethnic bloodletting. He said UN commander General Romeo Dallaire planned to meet Army chief of staff General Augustin Bizimungu later Friday to discuss the French military intervention and the future UN role in Rwanda.
