FBIS3-18578 "drweu044aa_94002" FBIS-WEU-94-044 Document Type:Daily Report 7 March 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS EU Sees Warning in Revival of U.S. Super 301 AU0403153594 Paris AFP in English 1522 GMT 4 Mar 94 AU0403153594 Paris AFP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Brussels, March 4 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU] sees the U.S. decision to reinstate its Super 301 trade sanction law as a warning to both Europe and Japan, a senior EU negotiator said here Friday [4 March]. He was reacting to the decision by President Bill Clinton to reactivate Super 301, which allows him to order punitive tariffs of up to 100 percent on a country that continues to obstruct imports of U.S. products. The move was aimed at Japan's trade surplus with the United States following Tokyo's refusal to accept numerical targets for opening its market to American goods. The EU negotiator, who asked not to be named, quoted the U.S. Administration as saying the move would be limited to areas of trade not dealt with in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). This could mean that the United States could use Super 301 as a threat in current negotiations with the European Union to open up public contracts to full competition by 1996, he said. The two sides are negotiating certain areas in public procurement omitted from a deal struck among the European Union, the United States and 10 other countries last December to open up the sector. They are trying to reach agreement by April 15. The European Union has said it will exclude U.S. tenderers from telecommunications contracts until European firms have full access to American public contracts offered below Federal Government level. The EU negotiator said Washington could use Super 301 to force open the European telecommunications market if the dispute was not settled by the time the Uruguay Round is formally signed in Marrakesh on April 15. "That is why the U.S. decision (to reactivate Super 301) must be considered as a serious warning," he said. But the official added that the United States was not expected to use its trade weapon in another area excluded from the Uruguay Round -- the audiovisual sector where the European Union is officially discriminating against U.S. films and television programmes. The issue is on the agenda of a meeting of EU foreign ministers here on Monday and Tuesday. The ministers are due to discuss the European Union's possibilities of trade reprisals. Earlier Friday, EU Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan said the U.S. decision to resurrenct Super 301 was disappointing. Officials said he had telephoned U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor to express European concern. Brittan said the European Union would be studying the move carefully to see if it violated U.S. trade commitments, particularly in the Uruguay Round, despite Kantor's assurances to the contrary. In London on Thursday, former British premier Margaret Thatcher said U.S. pressure on Japan was "a step backwards." She said: "Only by freeing the Japanese market from regulation and interference will you make it more open." A similar approach has been taken by Brittan. Last month he announced a twin programme to make European goods more attractive to the Japanese, while at the same time using diplomatic pressure to overcome market access difficulties. But he came out in opposition to numerical targets and trade quotas. And in a bid to help defuse the trade tension between Tokyo and Washington, Brittan suggested a "trilateral approach" in which the three sides would work together to overcome Japanese trade barriers. EU officials said his offer had not received an enthusiastic response from Washington. [In Paris, French Industry and Foreign Trade Minister Gerard Longuet said Friday afternoon that "France condemns any recourse to a unilateral instrument" in the trade field, referring to the reinstatement of "Super 301." [He said in a communique that "the idea we have of the U.S. role in the world is hard to reconcile with a method that can hit any country at any time, if a country enjoys strong competitiveness to the detriment of American interests." [The minister added that the retaliatory device, "applied to offset a structural deficit, the U.S. deficit with Japan, is not of such nature as to resolve the problem."] [passage omitted]
