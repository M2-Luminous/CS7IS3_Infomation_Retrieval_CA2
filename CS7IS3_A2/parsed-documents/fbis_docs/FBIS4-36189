The prime minister spoke with correspondents yesterday at Haifa University, where he received an honorary doctorate. Haviva Roger reports: [Begin recording] [Roger] Until it is proven otherwise, Yitzhaq Rabin asserted, I consider Ron Arad to be alive. Al-Dirani's abduction to Israel added information about Ron Arad. [Rabin] He is talking, but I will not say what he is saying. There is additional information about the past, and I hope that the same may perhaps also be true with regard to the future. At this stage, one must be cautious and not make unnecessary statements. Since I cannot state with certainty that Ron Arad is no longer alive, his status is that of a POW or MIA. Until proven otherwise, I consider him alive. [Roger] The prime minister expressed the assessment that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will arrive by the end of the month for another round of talks between Syria and Israel. Rabin believes that the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] operations against Hizballah centers will not affect the negotiations. The understandings reached after Operation Accountability stipulate that just as Hizballah can act against SLA [South Lebanese Army] and IDF military targets, Israel can operate against Hizballah installations that are not located within civilian population centers. [Rabin] As in the past, Hizballah continues to initiate terrorist attacks against us. We will not play by its rules. [Roger] Yitzhaq Rabin, who spoke on behalf of various luminaries receiving honorary doctorates, reminded his audience that the 1967 war broke out exactly 27 years ago, saying that it was a war in which united Jerusalem became ours forever. Outside the Haifa University campus, the members of the Eretz Yisra'el Front demonstrated. Large police forces prevented them from entering the campus. [end recording] [In a later report in the same newscast, Qol Yisra'el adds that, speaking yesterday, "Prime Minister Rabin said that the PLO has not yet adapted itself to assume responsibility for a civilian community." In a recorded passage, Rabin says: "Those who sought to assume responsibility for the area must also supply the people with occupations and the means to make a livelihood. I have no doubt that a process of adjustment is necessary. The PLO has never been responsible for the life of a community. If that organization wishes to mature and assume responsibility, it is high time it found the mechanisms that will enable the donor countries to give money, because the donor countries are prepared to contribute funds. The donor countries are all democracies, however, and it is inconceivable for them to just hand over $100 million to the PLO or its chairman and tell the Palestinians to do whatever they want with the money. As a result of their own internal structure and institutions, they can only contribute funds within the framework of a controlled budget, set out clearly in black and white, and the PLO has not yet adjusted to this."]
