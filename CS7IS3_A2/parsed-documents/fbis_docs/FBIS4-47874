Pictures of Mr Sexwale weeping over the lifeless body of Hani flashed across the world and in many ways the days to follow would gain him much support of the militant youth mourning their leader Chris Hani. Himself a former MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] cadre Sexwale joined the African National Congress underground structure in the 1970's and in 1975 he went into exile to undergo military training in the Soviet Union, specialising in army engineering. He returned to South Africa in the late seventies and was arrested after a run-in with the South African security forces. Together with 11 other activists he was charged with terrorism and conspiracy to overthrow the government -- and he was convicted and sentenced to 18 [years] imprisonment at Robben Island maximum prison in 1978. He served 13 years of his term before he was released in 1990 in terms of the Groote Schuur agreement between the government and the ANC. Four months after his release he was elected to the Executive Committee of the ANC's PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region. In October 1991 he was elected as chairperson of the region -- a post to which he was re-elected three times. In 1994 he was elected unopposed and also stood as the ANC's candidate for the PWV premiership in the April election. Mr Sexwale was born on March 5, 1953 in Johannesburg where he lived and attended school in Soweto until his matriculation at Orlando West High School. He was also a member of the Black Consciousness Movement in the late 1960's and seventies. Mr Sexwale enjoys reading and listening to music and when time permits watching soccer and playing tennis. He is also a keen chess player -- although he claims he always loses. He is married to Judy whom he met while on Robben Island. They have three children.
