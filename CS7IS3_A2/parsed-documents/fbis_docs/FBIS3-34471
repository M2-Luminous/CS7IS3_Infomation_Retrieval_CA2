He denied that the worsening crisis can be blamed on external factors. In statements to AL-AHRAM published Wednesday, he noted that charges that his country is providing refuge for terrorists might be prompted by some Afghan Arabs' infiltration of Yemen. He said that their infiltration takes place secretly and without the security authorities' consent. He pointed out that Yemen has managed to normalize its relations with some of the Gulf Cooperation Council member countries and is still pursuing normalization with other countries so that these ties will return to their level preceding the crisis of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. He called for not using the new oil oil discoveries in his country as pretext for contemplating partition, otherwise its wealth will turn into a misfortune instead of a blessing. He said that clouds still loom Arab-Iraqi ties and that further strenuous efforts and essential amendments to the Arab League charter are needed. On Yemen's stand on the Middle East market, the Yemeni foreign minister said his country is not inclined to end the boycott of Israel before a comprehensive and just peace is established in the region.
