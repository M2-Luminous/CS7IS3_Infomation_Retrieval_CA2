What prospects are there for the development of bilateral Russian-Tajik relations? [Samadov] We very quickly found with the Government of Russia an understanding of the problems that we have encountered in 1994. These problems ensue primarily from a combination of three very complex processes: political transformations in the Republic of Tajikistan connected with the adoption of the new constitution; a referendum to determine the form of government; the preparation of free elections with the participation of all Tajiks, wherever they may be, and all Tajikistanis who acknowledge the laws of the country. Having conducted a series of intensive negotiations with the top leadership of the Russian Government and with leading ministers, we leave with confidence that the understanding that was reached will be realized in specific mechanisms and concrete actions on both sides. I would like to mention that our government has embarked on the path of a broader dialogue with all structures of the Russian state and Russian intellectuals. We are treating with sufficient responsibility the task of realization in 1994 of the intergovernmental agreement between Tajikistan and Russia. A group of Russian specialists left for Tajikistan together with me, and will help us look into the financial system, the economy of the enterprises, and the economy of the regions. It would seem to me that the task the government is setting, which met with understanding at this stage, let us say, must be accomplished. I would formulate this task as follows: the unprecedented activity of Russian business circles, Russian business, Russian politicians, and Russian scientists in Tajikistan. Tajikistan today is quite an intricate knot of very topical, interesting problems and a fertile field of application for foreign investments. But why should the share of Russian capital not be more significant here? Why en route to the formation of stock companies from the enterprises, which were once built on the basis of Russian technology, can we not create new forms of the organization of these works via the formation of international stock companies? [Sizov] You have emphasized repeatedly that a principal cause of the crisis situation of the national economy is the mass exodus of highly skilled specialists from Tajikistan, Russian-speaking specialists included. How do you intend to resolve this problem? [Samadov] I would like first of all to evaluate this problem as such. Many Tajiks have left the republic also. If we are to be objective, this has led in practice to the incapability of many structures. Once, back in the phase of discussion of the law on the official language in Tajikistan, I said that this process could not be approached airily, with the emphasis on national self-awareness and the need for its upsurge and revival. It is impossible to enter the 21st century in isolation from the world and without tackling such problems as, say, information support in the sphere of new technology, research, production, the organization of production, international relations, and so forth. I believe that the failure to understand many such circumstances led to this process beginning. I believe that the political stability of Tajikistan is the first and main condition of a return of the departed specialists. Another problem: We need to solve in a new way and fundamentally the question of their remuneration and the protection of their interests in Tajikistan. And the government is now tackling this problem. [Sizov] Unless I am mistaken, there are now over 20 million Tajiks in the world, and 5 million live in your republic, but the republic is multinational. For example, over 1.5 million Uzbeks live with you also. How are your relations shaping up today with neighboring Uzbekistan? [Samadov] From its first steps our government has managed to direct these relations into the constructive channel of mutual understanding. As far as the Tajik and Uzbek peoples are concerned, I am sure that, considering the age-old historical relations on the vast expanse of Central Asia, these relations cannot be hostile, and all attempts to provoke an exacerbation of these relations will be cut short. [Sizov] In the course of the top-level Ashgabat meeting of heads of state of the CIS the question of the peacekeeping mission of Russia and Commonwealth countries on the Tajik-Afghan border was discussed also. How might you now, two months on, characterize the situation on the border and the role of the peace-keeping force? [Samadov] It is hard to exaggerate its role. It is truly a very powerful stabilizing factor. I have to say a word of gratitude primarily to the government, the top statesmen, and the president of Russia for the attention they are giving a resolution of this problem. We know that in the spring of 1994 certain forces will begin to muster on the other side for a more large-scale penetration of the territory of Tajikistan. It is not enough to say that we have the forces to resist. It is essential to intensify the political dialogue, including with representatives of the opposition who want peaceful development in Tajikistan and a peaceful solution of the problems that have risen to confront the republic. We need to start this as early as possible, without waiting for some period of time and without putting forward prior conditions, having included in this process, of course, international organizations, primarily the United Nations, and also, undoubtedly, Russia and the countries of Central Asia. Our government is prepared to do everything necessary for the start of this process. [Sizov] Last winter, when the question of the possibility or impossibility of dialogue with the forces of the opposition was raised, the leadership of Tajikistan adopted a guarded attitude toward this and held back even from such negotiations in the long term. Do you believe that time is dictating different conditions, and is a dialogue with those who truly are for the democratic path of Tajikistan's development possible? [Samadov] The last phrase is the key. The government is prepared to negotiate with those who are for a democratic path of the development of Tajikistan. These forces today call themselves the opposition. Opposition to what? Some personalities in the government? Their own state? The policy of the government or the path for which this government is opting? Here is a subject for negotiations. I repeat that we need without any prior conditions to agree to facilitate by joint efforts the complex political, economic, and social processes of integration that are already occurring in Tajikistan in 1994. [Sizov] As we all know, there is a major uranium deposit in the north of Tajikistan, which enabled us formerly to create the "nuclear shield." There have come to be reports in the news media that Tajikistan would possibly be prepared to sell the uranium raw material to countries of the Arab world, Iran has been cited also. Do you not think that some people are pushing Tajikistan into playing the "uranium card"? [Samadov] There are no people in our government or in today's leadership of the republic of Tajikistan, I believe, who suffer from such a disease. I am convinced that the process of the sale of the uranium, which is monitored by the appropriate international organizations, produced on the territory of the republic will be precisely as it has been thus far. I state that all attempts to link Tajikistan with countries aspiring to include it in the development of their uranium programs, other than the countries with which we have a stable relationship in this sphere, primarily Russia, are groundless. These attempts have no political prospects.
