After expressing his best wishes, he said the people are coping well with the trials of the early years of transition to market conditions. Although farmers have gathered in a fine harvest, a difficult situation has taken shape in that sphere, as well as in some others, owing to failure to pay. The president is confident that all these hardships are temporary and will be overcome through joint efforts. A policy which regards social programs as a priority is being pursued in the republic. Talking about the relations with Russia, Tatarstan's president said: "We are continuing consistent work aimed at reaching various agreements, taking into account the achievements made by Tatarstan on the civilized route toward establishing its statehood." Such is the will of the people, President Shaymiyev concluded. Wishing his countrymen a happy new year, he told them to strengthen links of blood and spirit between one another.
