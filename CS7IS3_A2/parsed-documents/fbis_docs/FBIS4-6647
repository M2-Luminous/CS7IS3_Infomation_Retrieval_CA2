The Social Democratic Party (SDP), the largest of the coalition parties, is stipulating that an increase in direct taxes should be linked to "an end to the consumption tax and the establishment of new taxation after seeking the people's consent." The other parties want reference to the consumption tax restricted to the expression "including reorganization of" the tax, but support a compromise that omits reference to "the consent of the people." At meetings of its three top executives and its central executive committee, the SDP leadership spent the morning discussing possible ways to reach a compromise with the other coalition parties. But during a 10.30 A.M. [0130 GMT] break in proceedings, sources said, it appeared the party was determined to insist on the revised proposals it had originally put before a meeting of coalition leaders on Wednesday. If agreement is reached among all the coalition members Thursday, the parties will hold a meeting of their leaders to secure written assent to the deal and choose Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, leader of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], as successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Shinseito is the coalition's second largest party. This outcome would mean that a plenary session of both houses of the Diet could not be convened until Friday at the earliest, but political sources said it is possible political manoeuvering and negotiations over the new cabinet could further delay the process until Saturday. Other policy issues negotiated among coalition members included the question of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons. The SDP holds that in the event of an emergency, Japan should engage in "close collaboration" with the United States, South Korea and China. But Shinseito's top strategist Ichiro Ozawa disagreed, arguing that in a hypothetical circumstance where China has exercised its right to a veto in the United Nations Security Council and Japan subsequently is subjected to a missile attack, Japan would be unable to engage in "close collaboration" with China, nor treat it in the same manner as the U.S. and South Korea. SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told reporters Thursday morning that the party would engage in "spirited debate" over the unresolved issues. "We have to deal with the budget as soon as possible," Murayama said. "We are reaching the limit. We want to sort things out somehow."
