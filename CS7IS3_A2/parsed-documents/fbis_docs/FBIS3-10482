These documents could allegedly prove that the current administration of President Juan Carlos Wasmosy is illegitimate. Luis Maria Argana, the leader of the faction, also was present at the Supreme Court when the presentation was made. The Supreme Court received five thick binders which contain 5,000 notarized photocopies of electoral records from the capital, Concepcion, San Pedro, Cordillera, Guaira, Caaguazu, Caazapa, Itaugua, Itapua, Misiones, Paraguari and Alto Parana. The records bear the signatures of the presidents, vice presidents, and faction representatives of each voting station. The plea states: "These documents clearly show the true results of the Colorado Party elections held on 27 December 1992." According to the plea, the total vote count yields the following result: Ticket No. 4 [Argana] 215,764 votes; Ticket No. 2 [Wasmosy] 188,949 votes, which means that the Colorado Reconciliation Movement won the elections by 26,815. It is explained that only the vote counts for presidential and vice presidential candidates are being objected to as unconstitutional, not the vote count for senators and deputies. The plea emphasizes that "it is aimed at laying bare this monstrous fraud and paving the way for the appropriate criminal lawsuit and claims for damages against the people involved."
