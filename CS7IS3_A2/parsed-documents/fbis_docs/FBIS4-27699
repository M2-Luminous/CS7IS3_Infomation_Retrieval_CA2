The issue consists of the U.S. Government's request to add financial services to the priority sectors, which means that other facets of the financial sector will potentially become targets of negotiations following the imminent agreement on the insurance sector. The setting of numerical goals has been avoided, but the agreement to resume the talks included provision for measurement of "market participation and sales expansion" for each sector, which would indicate difficult negotiations for the MOF. The trade talks targeted financial services from the very beginning, but the recent request was a move to make financial services a priority negotiating goal on a par with insurance, automobiles, and government procurement. According to the MOF, in past negotiations, the U.S. Government sought 1) relaxation of controls on management of public annuity funds, 2) modification of the rule that managing underwriting services are limited to four major securities firms, and 3) clarification of government controls over financial services. The primary focus will be directed at restrictions on the management of public annuity funds. The Pension Welfare Service Public Corporation has contracted with life insurance companies and trust and banking companies to manage a portion of the welfare annuity and national annuity funds, but the U.S. Government has asked that the management of such funds be extended to investment consulting firms. The Ministry of Health and Welfare had once filed the same request with the MOF, but the MOF which issues loans for the management of the funds rejected the request, saying such action would expose the funds to mismanagement, indicating that negotiations with the U.S. Government will inevitably encounter difficulty. The MOF comments, "We have merely heard of the U.S. request," about the demand for priority negotiations, but confidentially they are concerned. Since early in the negotiations, the U.S. representatives have said that numerical goals were not sought for the insurance sector and, according to sources at the International Finance Bureau, if talks are resumed, "We can be assured of an agreement" by July. He takes that position because, just as it appeared that the pending issues would be resolved, the financial services issue which was expected to be presented somewhat later was suddenly tabled. However, the U.S. Government had sought decontrol of Japanese financial markets until the final stages of the Uruguay Round negotiations, and U.S. Assistant Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers gave a speech in March 1994, indicating the intention to make financial services a point of emphasis in trade talks with Japan. Moreover, legislation is pending in Congress to virtually target Japan for retaliation in the financial services sector. Considering the atmosphere in the United States, it could be seen that it was only a matter of time before additional facets of the financial sector would be made targets of the trade talks. The concern of the Japanese Government was reflected in the items concurred with in the agreement to resume the trade talks. Both governments agreed that "market participation and sales increases for competitive foreign products" would be sought for each principal sector. The U.S. Government declared that it would not seek numerical goals, but this agreement can be interpreted to indicate that Japan promised "to ensure a definite increase in foreign product sales." In the financial services sector, the U.S. Government seeks dismantling of virtual monopoly by four major securities firms, and there is the risk that the failure of U.S. firms to increase their underwriting share could be treated as a violation of the agreement. The U.S. side is expected to demand decontrol of the markets in lieu of numerical goals, and the MOF, which had agreed to this particular approach in order to win resumption of the trade talks, may find itself obligated to follow such an approach.
