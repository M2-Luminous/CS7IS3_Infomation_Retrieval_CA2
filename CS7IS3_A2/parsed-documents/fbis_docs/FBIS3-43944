In talks, the government and the PAC agreed to establish three working committees to meet as early as next week to take further Thursday's "exploratory meeting". A possible first meeting between President F W de Klerk and PAC leader Clarence Makwetu was also raised "and may be taken further", a government spokesman said afterwards. The two sides met for two hours at the offices of government chief negotiator Roelf Meyer. The issues discussed were: -- whether there should be one or two ballot papers on April 27. The PAC, like the Freedom Alliance, wants one for the national government and one for the provincial government; -- amnesty for members of the PAC's armed wing, the Azanian Peoples Liberation Army, in the wake of the PAC's suspension of its armed struggle; -- the PAC's participation in the Transitional Executive Council. The PAC announced it would join the body only if there was joint control over all the country's armed forces; and -- the PAC's participation on the executive council sub-council on defence. Some executive council participants have argued that PAC representation on the sub-council would meet its demand for proper joint control over the armed forces. The government's Departments of Defence, Justice and Constitutional Development will together with PAC representation form the three working committees. "The most important thing we want to discuss with government is the question of one ballot or two ballots," PAC negotiator Gora Ebrahim told SAPA. The PAC had consistently favoured two ballots, he said.
