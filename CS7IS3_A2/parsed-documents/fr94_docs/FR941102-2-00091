FR941102-2-00091 FR941102-2-00067 The proposal was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34711 (September 23, 1994), 59 FR 50304 (October 3, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. Currently, CBOE Rule 9.8(c) provides that background and financial information of customers who have been approved for options transactions must be maintained at both the branch office servicing the customer's account and at the principal supervisory office with jurisdiction over the branch office. In addition, copies of options customer account statements over the most recent six months must be maintained at both the branch office supervising the accounts and at the principal supervisory office with jurisdiction over that branch. The CBOE proposes to amend CBOE Rule 9.8(c) and Interpretation and Policy .03 to enable members' supervisory offices to maintain certain customer account information at off-site locations as long as the records are readily accessible and promptly retrievable. The CBOE states that the substance of CBOE Rule 9.8(c) appears uniformly in the rules of the other options exchanges and in the options account rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD''). According to the CBOE, on-site storage in major financial centers is expensive, and, in today's market environment, automated and secure facilities for data storage and retrieval make it unnecessary to require on-site storage. The CBOE states that, given those realities, the Options Self-Regulatory Council (``OSRC'') 5 has recommended that record retention requirements be relaxed and that the exchanges and the NASD amend their rules to permit supervisory offices to store customer records off-premises as a matter of routine practice. 6 The CBOE concurs with the OSRC's recommendation and believes that its proposal will provide the CBOE's members with the opportunity to discharge their supervisory responsibilities more efficiently and more cost-effectively. 5 The OSRC, which was created pursuant to a plan submitted by the options exchanges under Rule 17d&hyph;2 (``17d&hyph;2 plan'') under the Act, includes representatives from each of the registered options exchanges and the NASD. The 17d&hyph;2 plan was developed by the exchanges and approved by the Commission to reduce regulatory duplication and to coordinate solutions to options-related sales practice issues common to firms which are members of two or more self-regulatory organizations. 6 In connection with the OSRC's recommendation, the designated options examining authorities, including the CBOE, have committed to periodic examinations of the document retention and supervisory practices of firms using off-site storage arrangements. The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and to protect investors and the public interest. The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b)(5) in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to facilitate transactions in securities, and to protect investors and the public interest. 7 7 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988). Specifically, by allowing off-site storage of customer account information maintained at supervisory offices, the Commission believes that the proposal should provide the CBOE's members with a cost-effective means to utilize computers, facsimile machines, optical disks, and other technology to store the required customer account information off-site while ensuring that member firms will continue to have easy access to all of the customer account information necessary to discharge their supervisory responsibilities. In this regard, the proposal provides that options customer account information stored off-site must be ``readily accessible and promptly retrievable,'' 8 thereby preserving the Exchange's ability to access and investigate customer account records. The Commission notes that the designated options examining authorities, including the CBOE, have agreed to make periodic examinations of the document retention and supervisory practices of firms using off-site storage arrangements. Thus, the Commission believes that the proposal strikes a reasonable balance between the CBOE's interest in allowing member organizations to reduce the cost of storing customer account information and ensuring that the information continues to be available for supervisory purposes. 8 See October 24 Letter, supra note 4. In addition, the Commission believes that it is reasonable for the CBOE to allow off-site storage of customer account information maintained at supervisory offices, but not of account information stored at branch offices, because branch offices are responsible for the day-to-day administration of customer accounts and require immediate access to account information. For example, by continuing to require branch offices to store customer account information on-site, the proposal facilitates broker compliance with the suitability requirements applicable to options customers. It is therefore ordered, Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 9 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;94&hyph;30) is approved. 9 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1982). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 10 10 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary.
