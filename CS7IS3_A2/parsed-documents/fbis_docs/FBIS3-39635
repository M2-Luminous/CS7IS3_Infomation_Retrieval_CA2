"Spain's position is very clear. We are opposed to a system under which Sweden's contribution to the EU's budget is phased in," Spanish Finance Minister Pedro Solbes told SVENSKA DAGBLADET. "We have had such transitional arrangements in the past, but at that time there was also gradual integration into the EU system. Sweden will be a full member from day one and from this it follows that Sweden will have all the rights and all the duties of a member country from day one. "I also understand that this is a very sensitive issue for Sweden and this is why I think that it will not be resolved until the final moments in the negotiations," said Spain's finance minister, who was formerly European affairs minister and one of those responsible for Spain's membership negotiations with the EU in the eighties. Pedro Solbes also denied the reports published in THE FINANCIAL TIMES on Monday [14 February] that claimed that Spain had proposed that the new EU members' contributions to the EU's budget should go in their entirety to the four poorest member countries -- Greece, Spain, Portugal, and Ireland. "I have never seen such a proposal, and I think that the idea is totally idiotic," Pedro Solbes said. Finance Minister Anne Wibble and Under Secretary of State Carl B. Hamilton are making a round-trip through the EU capitals to win sympathy for Sweden's budget demands. The first positive development in the finance minister's diplomatic mission could come today when she meets with Peter Schmidhuber, who is the EC commissioner responsible for the budget. The Commission has calculated the flow of money between Sweden and the EU in a way that is much more favorable for Sweden than the results the Swedish Finance Ministry has arrived at. The Commission's calculations, which SVENSKA DAGBLADET reported on Saturday, predict that Sweden's contribution to the EU budget will be around 17 billion kronor -- around 5 million kronor less than Sweden's calculations. The Commission estimates the flow of money back to Sweden at around 12 billion kronor, while the Finance Ministry calculations are somewhere between 7 and 12 billion. According to the Commission, the net contribution from Sweden would therefore amount to 5 billion kronor per year -- something that looks like a happy calculation for Sweden. The Swedish side is distrustful of the Commission's estimates, but if they do turn out to be correct the budget issue would suddenly become a relatively easy point in the negotiations. Perhaps Sweden would even drop its demand?
