The article goes on: In South Korea the population are deprived of even their freedom to see, hear and speak as they please, to say nothing of the freedom of ideological choice and political activity, and not only their material and cultural life but their right to live are ruthlessly trampled upon. What matters in the human rights situation in South Korea is, above all, that the repressive legal system and machines are not only maintained but further mal-revised [word as received] and supplemented. The Kim Yong-sam group not only has maintained the legal and institutional devices including the "National Security Law" which the preceding military fascist regimes had made the foundation of their existence, but also has expanded and strengthened the functions and role of such repressive tools as the "Security Planning Board" and "secret affairs command", the headquarters of evils, in a crafty way and drastically reinforced the puppet police to ruthlessly suppress the righteous struggle of the people at any time and in any place. The human rights situation in South Korea offers a problem also because not only those who conduct patriotic, democratic activities but the workers, peasants and other labouring masses who champion their right to existence and even dissident democratic organizations are suppressed, branded as "leftist violent forces". The fascist clique had arrested more than 200 students, intellectuals and others by invoking the "National Security Law" by October last year. This is 2.5 times the figure of those arrested in the initial corresponding period of the No Tae-u fascist clique's tenure. What must not be overlooked is that the fascist clique is mercilessly cracking down on the workers and peasants who call for their right to live. Grave human rights abuses by the Kim Yong-sam group are found in the fact that brutal tortures remain unabated, with a large number of patriots and guiltless people ruthlessly killed by tortures or punished on false "charges". Brutal tortures of all descriptions are inflicted on any detainees, whether they be aged and sick, women and even pregnant women, once they are arrested, in order to wrest false confessions. Facts clearly show that the Kim Yong-sam regime is, indeed, a regime destroying human rights under the "civilian" veil. The reality apparently confirms that the human rights problem in South Korea cannot be solved unless the Kim Yong-sam fascist regime is toppled.
