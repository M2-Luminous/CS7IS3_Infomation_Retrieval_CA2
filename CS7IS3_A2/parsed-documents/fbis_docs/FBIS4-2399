These are China's latest steps to avoid a possible "overheating" of the futures market and to bring the fledgling industry onto a healthy development track. According to Zhu Li, secretary-general of China Securities Regulatory Committee, which was entrusted by the State Council last December to guide and monitor all futures trading in China, the country will also tighten the crackdown on underground futures trading. The past two years have seen more than 500 futures corporations spring up across the country, of which 50 are Sino-joint ventures, and over 200 are unregistered ones. At present there are 30 futures markets or trading centers in operation; trading items range from crude oil, farm produce, non-ferrous metal to black metal, building materials and treasury bonds. However, many of these markets and corporations are not up to the required standards, Zhu said. Moreover, some of the joint corporations are run for speculative purposes. They have employed whatever means possible to deceive Chinese clients, "resulting in the huge outflow of foreign currencies and great economic losses." Zhu said that in the absence of a legal framework and international expertise, the futures trading at present in China should be done under strict supervision. "Rushed experiments could only incur economic losses and even social unrest," said Zhu. He revealed that the securities regulatory committee is working with relevant government departments in mapping out a more detailed plan to redress the disorder in the futures market.
