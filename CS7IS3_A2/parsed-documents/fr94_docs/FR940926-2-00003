FR940926-2-00003 FR940926-2-00002 Announcement of the William C. Foster Fellows Visiting Scholars Program for the 1995&hyph;96 School Year The U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) will conduct a competition for selection of visiting scholars to participate in ACDA's activities during the 1995&hyph;96 academic year. Section 28 of the Arms Control and Disarmament Act (22 U.S.C. 2568) provides that ``A program for visiting scholars in the field of arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament shall be established by the Director in order to obtain the services of scholars from the faculties of recognized institutions of higher learning.'' The law states that ``The purpose of the program will be to give specialists in the physical sciences and other disciplines relevant to the Agency's activities an opportunity for active participation in the arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament activities of the Agency and to gain for the Agency the perspective and expertise such persons can offer *␣*␣*. Fellows shall be chosen by a board consisting of the Director, who shall be the chairperson, and all former Directors of the Agency.'' Scholars are known as William C. Foster Fellows, in honor of the first Director of ACDA, William C. Foster, who served from the inception of ACDA in 1961 until 1969. ACDA began this program by competitively selecting six visiting scholars for the 1984&hyph;85 academic year. The competition has continued each subsequent academic year until the present. One-year assignments will begin at a mutually agreeable time after successful completion of all employment requirements. Positions are available in the Bureau of Strategic and Eurasian Affairs (SEA), the Bureau of Multilateral Affairs (MA), the Bureau of Intelligence, Verification and Information Support (IVI), and the Bureau of Nonproliferation Policy and Regional Arms Control (NP). A brochure is available describing these positions in detail. Evaluation of applicants for appointments to these positions will focus upon the scholar's potential for providing expertise or performing services needed by ACDA, rather than on the scholar's previously displayed interest in arms control. While pursuit of the scholar's own line of research may sometimes be possible, support of such activity is not the purpose of the program. Visiting scholars will be detailed to ACDA by their universities; the universities will be compensated for the scholar's salary and benefits in accordance with the Intergovernmental Personnel Act and within Agency limitations. Visiting scholars will also receive reimbursement for travel to and from the Washington, D.C. area for their one-year assignment and either a per diem allowance during the one-year assignment or relocation costs. Visiting scholars must be citizens of the United States, on the faculty of a recognized institution of higher learning, and tenured or on a tenure track or equivalent; they also must have served as a permanent career employee of the institution for at least ninety days before selection for the program. ACDA is an equal opportunity employer. Selections will be made without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or physical handicap that does not interfere with performance of duties. Prior to appointment applicants will be subject to a full-field background security investigation for a Top Secret security clearance, as required by Section 45 of the Arms Control and Disarmament Act. Visiting scholars will also be subject to applicable Federal conflict of interest laws and standards of conduct. To apply, candidates are asked to submit a letter outlining their interests and qualifications, a curriculum vitae, copies of two publications, and additional supporting material such as letters of reference. The application deadline for assignments for the 1995-1996 academic year is January 31, 1995, subject to extension at ACDA's discretion. ACDA expects to announce tentative selections in the spring of 1995.
