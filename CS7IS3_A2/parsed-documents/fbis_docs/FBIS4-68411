This is a notable day for us. The constituent congress of the Azerbaijan Democratic Property Owners' Party [ADSP] has begun. As of today one more political organization enters the social and political life of Azerbaijan. We are aware of how difficult and responsible and at the same time honorable a mission we are undertaking. We are firmly convinced that as a result of our activity this day will be an important landmark in the history of sovereign Azerbaijan. But serious efforts, the concentration of intellectual potential, and the assertiveness of all members of the party will be needed for this. At this moment the situation in the republic is extraordinarily complex. The economic, political, and spiritual crisis, a ruthless war, which has lasted six years now, the loss of thousands of young men and women in the struggle to liberate our land, over a million refugees forced to leave their native parts--all this is the reality of our present-day life. Various political forces have come to power in recent years in Azerbaijan and have attempted to extricate the country from the crisis. Unfortunately, these attempts have produced no results, and the crisis, intensifying all the while, has assumed wide-ranging proportions. We value the activity of the forces that contributed to the elimination of totalitarianism in Azerbaijan and to the enhancement of the role of national self-awareness. But we would like to note that the time has now come for people who are creators far removed from destructive activity and slogan-mongering. The period of revolutions is over, the time has come for new thinking and fundamental transformations. The populism of past years must give way to professionalism and specific constructive activity. Proceeding from the urgency of new ideas for our republic, we deemed necessary the creation of the Azerbaijan Democratic Property Owners' Party. There can be no doubt that our society can be rescued from the present grim situation only by people in possession of the new way of thinking. The future of Azerbaijan will depend on the extent to which the idea of enterprise is realized. We are for this reason laying the foundations of a party far removed from any radicalism and extremes and intent on developing society by purposive reforms. What do we mean when we speak of new ideas and relations, of new policies? The answer to this question may be gleaned from the very name of the party. The definition "Azerbaijan" symbolizes the party's devotion to the fatherland and its sovereignty. The party will operate in Azerbaijan and in the name of Azerbaijan. It will be based on the ideas of civicism. The word "Democratic" in the name of the party is also of great symbolic meaning. We believe that the majority of the current problems have been engendered by the fact that we have failed to reveal to the proper extent the very concept of "democracy." Democracy is not anarchy, not arbitrariness. It is the supremacy of the law over the state, over the citizens, over political forces. Democracy is the political power of the people. A multiparty system and freedom of speech are its main attributes. The supremacy of the law is a basic principle of our activity. And it is essential for this reason to replace with a new one the current constitution, which reflects the principles of the basic law of the Soviet period and which has undergone no fundamental revision. The concept of a party of "Property Owners" reflects the directions of its activity. In our opinion, a property owner is not simply an owner of property and an estate but the true master of them, as, equally, of his knowledge, capabilities, and intellect. In this sense each citizen of Azerbaijan should be a property owner. And it is in this direction that our party will undertake wide-ranging activity. The ADSP will propagandize new ideas and a new attitude toward the means of production and property and the need for enterprise and proprietorship for society under the conditions of the market economy. And the entrepreneur will be preoccupied by a single goal, a single desire--manufacturing a product that is competitive, conforms to world standards, and corresponds to public requirements. Success in the market economy will in the majority of cases depend on man's creative, constructive capabilities and entrepreneurial experience. For this reason the "enterprise" and "property" concepts could consolidate all citizens, all strata of society. We wish to see as property owners and masters the worker and the peasant and the professional. The ADSP will create all the conditions for the conversion of enterprises into stock companies, the distribution of the shares among the workers free of charge, and their enlistment in entrepreneurial activity in this way. The main task for us at the present time is not a struggle for power but the concentration of the entire potential for the extrication of the republic from the present profound state of crisis. The economic situation in the republic is very grim at this time. In Azerbaijan, with its generous natural resources, splendid climate, and enormous production resources, the living standard of the people is declining by the day and the social protection of the citizens is deteriorating. National income is falling rapidly. In 1993 this indicator constituted 27.5 percent of that of the previous year. Twenty-five percent less basic industrial commodities were manufactured than the year before. Inflation is rising, and compared with 1992 the issue of money by the National Bank increased by a factor of more than 29.6 and continues to grow. The production of all types of industrial and agricultural commodities continues, in fact, to fall. The main reason for this is the severance of economic ties to the republics of the former Union. But the state of crisis in which the economy has found itself has a number of subjective factors also. Thus, although the Azerbaijan Republic has acquired political independence and become a full member of the international community, its economic independence is still under serious threat. Our republic has opted for the market economy path, which is characteristic of the majority of the world's developed countries and based on economic logic. But the measures pertaining to the adoption and engagement of a new economic mechanism are only being implemented slowly; the mechanism of the former economic system, now in its death throes, continues to operate. Owing to the counteraction of many highly placed retrograde persons cherishing a dream of "everything, perhaps, going back to what it once was," transition to the market economy is being impeded and artificial barriers are being erected. The failure to adopt the corresponding laws on the market economy, the absence of a working mechanism for some laws which have been adopted, but which exist merely on paper, and the activity of state and executive authorities not brought into line with the new conditions are graphic testimony to this. In sum, economic destabilization has reached the point at which the economy has become the main factor of political instability. The indifference to the fate of the economic reforms and to the transition to market relations regulated by law represent a serious threat to the sovereignty of Azerbaijan. An acceleration of the reforms and the elimination of the asystemic approach in the shaping of the market economy are essential, therefore. The solution lies in the speediest establishment of the economic system proven by world practice. This means: --denationalization of the economy; --privatization; --the development of enterprise; --formation of the market and market infrastructure; --the use of progressive methods in the creation of business relations; --the elimination of administrative-command methods contradicting the market economy; --price liberalization based on the evolved supply and demand ratios; --the correct pursuit of financial, credit, and monetary policy; --refinement of the customs and tax systems; --an alleviation of the difficulties of the transition to the market economy by way of the creation of a system of guaranteed social protection. The enumerated comprehensive measures encompass three stages: a halt to the decline in production, an immediate transition to the market economy, and provision for the development and protection of this system. A halt to the decline in production is connected with denationalization and the implementation of an anticrisis policy. Unfortunately, privatization and fulfillment of the conditions of the transitional period are being undertaken extremely inadequately, and an economic structure adapted to the new realities is not being created. For this reason many state-owned enterprises of the republic are standing idle. And this, in turn, is causing a decline in production, a shortage of goods, unemployment, a deterioration in the well-being of the public, and a disruption of normal monetary circulation. Privatization should be effected in the quickest way possible, it being necessary first and foremost to privatize facilities of trade, public catering, consumer services, and small production enterprises. Fundamental reforms are needed in the financial, banking, and customs systems and in the sphere of foreign economic relations. The absence of the former in these spheres is impeding the transition to a market system, hampering a halt to the fall in production, and causing increased inflation. The state's financial policy is still being implemented by the former bureaucratic methods. This applies particularly to the work of the state banks. The activity, or rather inactivity, of the National Bank, which has become a stumbling block in the way of the development of enterprise and the formation of a market economy, is bewildering. Speaking of the obstacles put in the way of the activity of private structures and entrepreneurs, mention has to be made of the flaw in the customs and tax systems. The red tape, relapses into bureaucratism in the customs system, and the high customs duty are by no means serving to develop the market economy and enterprise. The party believes that it is necessary to elaborate and adopt new laws aimed at the democratization of the said spheres and to remove the shortcomings in them as quickly as possible. The lagging of the agrarian reforms in the republic and the fact that a number of the adopted laws and decisions are not working are accelerating by the day the slump that has encompassed agriculture. It is more than two years now since the draft Land Reform Act was published, but it has yet to be adopted. The indifferent attitude toward the great public property--our land--and inefficient and negligent land tenure have caused the erosion of over 600,000 hectares of land. Insuperable barriers have been erected between the land and the peasant. Hollow speeches concerning its lease and the creation of private farms are heard from time to time, but not even the minimum of the conditions necessary for this are being created. The peasant and, ultimately, the people are suffering. The party deems essential the privatization of the land and its unconditional transfer to those who cultivate it. Every peasant should be the master of his land and foster in his children the feeling of a proprietary attitude toward it. Whence the conclusion: It is necessary to restore historical justice, give back to the peasant the land, which was taken away from him 70 years ago essentially in the guise of nationalization, and thereby restore it to its rightful owner. But the intolerable procrastination over the reforms is leading to the loss of agriculture's material and technical resources. In the past three years alone there has been a steep decline in the numbers of livestock on the kolkhozes and sovkhozes, and the indicators of yield and productivity have fallen two- and threefold. The harvests of cereals, cotton, vegetables, grapes, and other agricultural products are declining rapidly. Confirmation of this may be seen in the example of Shamakhinskiy and Dzhalilabadskiy districts. The grape harvests in Shamakhinskiy District fell from 243,000 tonnes to 6 tonnes, and in Dzhalalabadskiy, from 250,000 tonnes to 10 tonnes! Are these not terrifying facts?! Can Azerbaijan be extricated from the economic crisis by such mismanagement? Of course not. No sector of agriculture is operating profitably. The bankruptcy of the kolkhozes and sovkhozes is on the doorstep. Agriculture remains the most laborious part of the economy, the pay in it is the lowest, and the peasantry is the most socially unprotected stratum of our society. To emerge from the crisis we need first and foremost to seek the development of peasant enterprise. Among the congress delegates there are many peasants who encounter daily the difficulties and problems connected with enterprise. Their speeches and proposals will be taken into consideration and will help refine our further activity. We are drawing up specific proposals connected with a resolution of the above-mentioned economic problems with regard to the transition to a market economy and the development of enterprise, and this package of proposals will be presented to the government within the next few days. Attaching great significance to science and education, the ADSP considers a solution of the problems in this sphere a most important task. We will contribute to an improvement in the material and technical resources of science and an improvement in scientists' work conditions and a rise in their living standard and thereby stimulate the development and progress of all sectors of the republic's economy. For an economy deprived of new scientific achievements is incapable of producing effective results. The party believes that for the accomplishment of the impending tasks in the period of transition to a market economy there will be a need for personnel that have attended a school of private enterprise. A certain amount of work has been performed in this sphere in the republic, and dozens of institutes and centers of education have been created. But instead of ensuring conditions stimulating the activity of these private centers of training and introducing the young people being taught there to world science, they are being subjected to groundless pressure. We believe that a state that has announced a transition to a market economy should not be demonstrating biased selectiveness but displaying concern also for this educational system, which is new in the life of Azerbaijan. Each member of the party should know that a society that is indifferent toward science and education is poor both materially and spiritually. We will aspire to the cooperation of scientists and entrepreneurs and to the implementation of their specific developments. The ADSP, appreciating on its merits the important role of culture and art in an enhancement of the living standard of the people, will contribute to the extrication from crisis of cultural institutions, whose physical resources have in recent years been undermined appreciably. Facilitate increased attention to figures of culture and art of the republic and to the creation of the necessary conditions for their creativity. We must revive the traditions of such patrons of the arts as Hajji Zeynalabdin Tagiyev and Musa Nagiyev and we shall call on all entrepreneurs and business people to take specific steps in this field. Our party will perform a great deal of work on the protection of monuments of culture and art and also on the return of our national treasures taken overseas. Azerbaijan is a multinational country. Representatives of various nationalities have lived on its territory as good neighbors of the Azerbaijani people for many centuries. The ADSP urges protection of the rights of the national minorities and ethnic groups and a solicitous attitude toward their customs, traditions, and language. The ADSP is for the mutual noninterference of religion and the state in each other's affairs. By virtue of the fact that the ancient culture of our people is closely linked with the Islamic religion, the party will exert efforts for the affirmation of a respectful attitude toward this religion and contribute to the study at the proper level of religious sources, the opening of religious schools, and the restoration of the mosques. The party will display respect for other religions also and adopt a solicitous attitude toward their religious structures. The ADSP considers religious intolerance impermissible. A legal basis for preferential conditions of the use of economic factors in health care, specifically, the channeling of capital from the private sector to this sphere, is a command of the times. A transition to health care for which a partial charge is made and the insurance medicine connected with it would undoubtedly bring our health care into line with today's economic system. The party believes that the treatment and improvement of medical services for persons who have been wounded and maimed in fighting to liberate our land should be the most important task of today's health care. We will endeavor to direct our domestic policy toward social assistance to the population. Needy families, including the families of refugees, martyrs, the handicapped, participants in the war, retirees, and large families will sense our concern. Speaking of social protection of the population, I would like to mention particularly the neglected state of housing construction and transport services in the republic. The profound crisis of the economy is being reflected increasingly palpably in this sphere. The steep decline in housing construction in recent years has engendered particular strain in the satisfaction of the public's housing requirements. This is explained by the fact that approximately 1 million of our compatriots have as a consequence of the Armenian aggression been forced to abandon their native parts and make their home in tents, hostels, sanatoriums, schools, and other nonresidential facilities. Many of them have poured into Baku, where great social strain has arisen in this connection. Attaching great significance to housing construction in the republic, the ADSP will endeavor to make full use in this sphere of the forces both of the state and the business world. It is necessary to this end to create the conditions for the entrepreneurs, allocate them the necessary plots of land, and make credit available to them. We will at the same time operate actively in the direction of an improvement in mass transit services and the removal of the problems that exist in this sphere. The extent of employment and joblessness is one of the main problems greatly worrying us today. The ADSP believes that the further development of enterprise, the emergence of new production divisions particularly, would signal a turning point in the resolution of this problem. I would at the same time like to mention that the unemployed, as a reality of our present life, must receive assistance and sense concern not only on the part of our business people but of the state also. We intend to display particular concern for the youth and adolescents. The defense of their rights and assurance of all the necessary conditions so that they might become worthy members of our society will always be at the center of the attention of the ADSP. I would like to make particular mention of one further problem. The lessening of concern for our future, children, inadequate teaching and educational work with them, and the inattention to them. This was undertaken more or less in the bygone Soviet period by, aside from the family, such public organizations as pioneer and Communist Youth League groups and clubs. The ADSP believes that it is necessary to increase the attention paid to children on the part of the state and to prepare and implement comprehensive measures in this sphere. We will make use of all our opportunities in this cause. The ADSP believes that a primary and sacred task currently confronting the whole Azerbaijani people and the state is the liberation of our land from the Armenian occupiers. Thousands of heroic sons and daughters of the Azerbaijani people have been wounded and maimed in battle and have died the death of the brave in this struggle. Today also the sons and daughters of our people are fighting heroically for their native land and wholeheartedly believe in the victory of the just cause. At the same time we are seriously alarmed by the fact that the state cannot secure fundamental changes in this sector and that the current shortcomings are not being eliminated in timely fashion. We believe that the leaders of the Azerbaijan state should create an army in which strict discipline rules and mobilize the people in the name of victory over the accursed enemy. Our party would render all possible assistance here. It is our profound belief that at a fateful time for Azerbaijan all political forces should unite in the struggle against the Armenian aggressors. The ADSP believes that the machinery of state should primarily be perfected and restructured on democratic principles, an executive mechanism conforming to the requirements of the market economy created, and the bureaucratism and red tape hampering our development removed for the accomplishment of the set goals and tasks. And the legislature, executive, and judiciary should primarily for this be delineated fully. We believe that the National Assembly does not represent the people to the full extent and has exhausted its historical mission. It is necessary, therefore, having secured stability in the republic as quickly as possible, to hold new elections to the supreme legislative body. Persons who put the interests of the people above personal interests, who would serve to build a strong state, and who are capable of independent decisionmaking should be represented in parliament. The executive should be formed from people who are creative, businesslike, just, and humane, who possess the new thinking, and who are capable of engaging in politics at the level of today's requirements. The supremacy of the law and an understanding of the irreversibility of progress along the path of the market economy should be the main yardstick in the activity of the executive. We will strive for the restructuring of the executive authorities in accordance with these demands, an improvement in their structure, and the abolition of duplicative components. It is necessary to carry out fundamental reforms in the administrative authorities and form the judiciary as the third branch of power in the true meaning of the word and ensure its complete independence. Each citizen of the republic, regardless of the position he holds, should have the right to appeal to the judicial authorities with a demand for the restoration of his violated rights. The law must not allow the groundless interference of the police and procuracy authorities in the activity of the private sector. It is necessary to clamp down on all factors leading to bribery, corruption, and arbitrary action in the administrative authorities. The ADSP believes that the successful accomplishment of the impending tasks and the correct management of personnel policy are very important. In all areas, personnel need to be chosen only in accordance with businesslike and professional qualities. Unfortunately, these criteria were for many years disregarded in the selection of personnel, which permitted the principles of nepotism and personal devotion to come to the fore. As a result positions in the managerial structures went to incompetent people devoid, at times, of the necessary moral qualities, which, as a whole, damaged the common interests of the Azerbaijani people and harmed the principles of its statehood. The ADSP emphatically condemns the selection of personnel for directive positions in accordance with family and protectionist criteria and notes the impermissibility of this approach. The party's activity in the field of foreign policy shall be based on international rules of law, the UN Charter, the principles generally accepted in the international community, and the constitution and the laws of the Azerbaijani state. Taking as a basis national interests and statehood, the international activity of Azerbaijan should serve peace, security, and mutually beneficial cooperation. The party deems essential the creation of direct diplomatic relations with states of the world and supports the territorial integrity and sanctity of the borders of all countries, their noninterference in one another's internal affairs, cooperation and peaceful coexistence, and the solution of all conflicts within the framework of international rules of law exclusively by way of negotiations. It proceeds from the provisions of UN documents defending human rights and liberties. The ADSP will endeavor to create close ties to overseas parties of a democratic persuasion and will broaden all-around cooperation with them in the interests of Azerbaijan. In the sphere of economic reform the ADSP will strive to ensure that the experience of the world's progressive countries be studied and applied in Azerbaijan and will create closer contacts with Azerbaijani businessmen living abroad. The party will facilitate the establishment of relations with all Azerbaijanis who live outside of the republic and also with the societies that unite them, support their activity in the interests of Azerbaijan, and contribute to the creation and development of the Azerbaijani diaspora in foreign countries. We call on other parties also to join in this initiative. We believe that there is now an even greater need for Azerbaijan to convey to the world community the voice of truth in the defense of its land. Together with bilateral relations in foreign policy the party notes the significance for the Azerbaijani state of multilateral relations, particularly the need for cooperation with regional and international organizations, and believes that it is necessary to take advantage of their strength and authority to have Armenia, which has occupied land of Azerbaijan, recognized as the aggressor. Esteemed delegates and guests of the congress! As a result of the purposive activity of the organizing committee of the ADSP action groups have in a short space of time been formed in 23 districts of Azerbaijan. This process is continuing rapidly, and the number of the party's supporters is growing by the day. This is reason for us to conclude that the ADSP will shortly be a most authoritative party of the republic. The draft program and rules of the party will be presented to you today. Your proposals, complaints, and criticisms will help perfect these documents. Ours is a democratic, parliamentary-type party. Members of the party will work in a creative atmosphere affording an opportunity for a display of initiative. Granted all this, there must be discipline in the party. Our principle is discussion of the party's decisions until they have been adopted. An adopted decision is law for all party members. The party will defend the interests of each of its members. And they, in turn, are called upon to strive to enhance the party's prestige by their activity. In view of the fact that ours is a constituent congress, we have not made it our purpose to express in the report our attitude toward all areas of the party's activity. The directive party authorities, which will be elected today, will together with the organizations being formed in the regions involve themselves in an improvement of the party's strategy and tactics at the current stage. We entrepreneurs must show graphically the benefit of our activity, implementing our ideas and striving for actual achievements. In the Soviet period the people's consciousness was poisoned by malicious communist propaganda to the effect that enterprising people are exploiters profiting at the people's expense, that they are to blame for the poor life of society, and that they are building their prosperity on the misfortunes of poor people. The useful work and noble accomplishments of creative, active entrepreneurs, who themselves knew how to live and afforded the people an opportunity to work and earn, were slandered. Back at the start of the century forces of occupation under the banner of revolution wiped out the genuine entrepreneurs and did unprecedented damage to the spirituality and economy of Azerbaijan. Thus was the principle of general ruin and the equalization of all in poverty realized. The party that we have founded advances the polar-opposite principle--equality not in poverty but equality in wealth. Its purpose is realization of the idea that all citizens are entitled to be and should be masters in the full meaning of this word. A nation that has failed to foster its own entrepreneurs will be forced to serve the entrepreneurs of other states. In this sense we must ourselves become the masters of our national wealth. And for this reason it is the sacred duty of each of us to propagandize extensively the idea of enterprise and to create all the conditions for the development of market relations. We need to unite all efforts in the name of the elimination of the obstacles in the way of the development of the market economy and enterprise, fight jointly against conservatives and, ultimately, build an independent state and wealthy country with strong authorities. We emphatically declare that only the entrepreneurs, that is, all of us, will liberate the republic from the present grim situation, from the economic crisis. The main purpose of our party is to achieve this and to act in the name of a strong and free Azerbaijan. I call on all of you to struggle for these national interests and, of course, for the expulsion from the territory of Azerbaijan of the accursed enemy. I thank you for your attention.
