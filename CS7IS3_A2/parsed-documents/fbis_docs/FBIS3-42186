Gen. Thelmo Cunanan has ordered his commanders to tighten security in all public places in Mindanao. Cunanan gave the order following information that the group of terrorists responsible for the blasts at the San Pedro Cathedral and two Muslim mosques in Davao City last month has transferred operations to other areas. The military and police were ordered to secure places like churches, markets and groceries, where there are crowds. He asked the public to bear with the inconvenience and discomfort of checkpoints and inspections. Meanwhile, Cunanan said police operations will continue against criminal elements despite the cease fire with the Moro National Liberation Front. "We will pursue these criminal elements wherever they are. We are already taking action against them," Cunanan said. He said the extremist Abu Sayaf is one of the groups hunted by the military and the police. As this developed, former Sulu Representative Sakur Tan confirmed that the Abu Sayaf group has increased in number and are equipped with highpowered armament. Tan, the principal negotiator in the release Monday of shipyard owner Ricardo Tong after 139 days of captivity, said he witnessed the gathering up of the Abu Sayaf group when he had a talk with two of the group's leaders somewhere in Patikul, Sulu.
