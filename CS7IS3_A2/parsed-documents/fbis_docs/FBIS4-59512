He said one of the pilots of these downed planes was alive and would confirm this fact himself, when his health allowed him to do so. The command of the Naval Forces has confirmed reports concerning the sinking of a gunboat belonging to the bloody al-Ahmar gang by our courageous Navy, which is vigilant in protecting our territorial waters. Commenting on statements by the so-called military source at the Defense Ministry under the al-Ahmar gang which, as usual, claimed that their forces were continuing their progress in the Kharaz area, the responsible source at the Defense Ministry confirmed that there was no truth in their reports, and that it was just part of the cheap media propaganda which the bloody al-Ahmar gang typically used. The source confirmed that our forces, the forces of unity, democracy, and modernism, had fought a rare defensive battle, in which they had resisted with courage and steadfastness the hordes of treachery and betrayal, and had inflicted heavy losses on those forces, forcing them to retreat and withdraw from where they had been pushed into the war by the adventurous al-Ahmar gang.
