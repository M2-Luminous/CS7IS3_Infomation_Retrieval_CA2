Meanwhile, talks in Lusaka, Zambia, seem to go on for ever. This week, the government offered UNITA a deal on posts in a future administration, but it seems the offer didn't include the governorship of Huambo, and UNITA has dug in its heels. Heba Saleh spoke to Deputy Foreign Minister Jorge Chikoty, currently in South Africa, and asked him whether the intensification of the government's campaign against UNITA reflected disillusionment with the talks. [Begin recording] [Chikoty] I do not think that that is correct. What has been happening is that there has been more fighting in certain areas. You know, Kuito has been besieged for almost two years now. This is the same situation in Malanje. It is the same situation in many other areas. So, there has always been intense fighting in Angola. What we think is that maybe the government has now been responding a little bit more adequately to some of UNITA's moves. So, you cannot say....[changes thought] It is wrong to say that the government has intensified its campaign against UNITA. It is UNITA that has been in a campaign against the government for two years and we all know that. [Saleh] But has the government still got any faith in the talks in Lusaka? [Chikoty] Well, yes. We think that it all depends on UNITA to react. You know, we have made a considerable offer. We thought that the major problem until now was the fact we did not have a large participation of UNITA in the previous offers. Now, this has been done. So, we hope now that we shall be getting very close to conclusion in the next few weeks. That is what we think. [Saleh] But I understand that UNITA has submitted certain proposals to the government side and that the government has rejected them? [Chikoty] The problem is, you know, that we cannot play to a vicious circle where every time we make an offer to UNITA, UNITA will say: I am going to analyze that. Then they will choose a few points and say: We don't agree with this. Well, for example, we have offered a package, and I have heard that, well, they have accepted it, but they have also said that they wanted, for example, the province of Huambo as governor. So, in my view, that is a rejection. That means that UNITA has rejected the offer of the government. They either take the whole offer that the government has made rather than discuss on the point. We have made more than 200 offers to UNITA, if we take everything into account -- that is the ministry positions, the deputy ministry positions, the ambassadors, the deputy governors, the governors, the municipal governors, the deputy municipal governors, the communal governors. I mean, that is a lot. How will they just single out one aspect. [Saleh] Why can't you give them control of Huambo? Huambo is very important to UNITA, and unless they regain control of Huambo, the war is going to go on. [Chikoty] Do you think that is what the problem is? They have a vice governor there. They have a deputy municipal governor. What UNITA wants is to find points of antagonism. The other point is: We also don't think that after a party has won an election, it is the one that lost who makes the rules. In my view, the problem does not lie on one particular province. The problem is that UNITA is having a problem of accommodating itself within a democratic situation whereby everybody else will have to be equal. That is the problem. That is what we have to look at.
