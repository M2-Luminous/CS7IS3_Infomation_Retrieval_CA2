Meeting reporters just a day before departing for Washington to meet with American officials on the upcoming U.S.-North Korea talks in Geneva, Kim said the focus would be on persuading Pyongyang to guarantee the transparency of its past, present and future nuclear activities. Asked about the U.S.-North Korea talks in Geneva, Kim replied that "we should closely watch how the discussions proceed." He added that inspection of the historical records of North Korea's nuclear program and U.S. aid for its installation of light-water reactors would be top issues. On the historical records of North Korea's nuclear development program, he stressed that the communist state must reveal the amount of plutonium extracted from spent fuel rods in the past and allow UN inspections of two undeclared sites at Yongbyon and the spent fuel rods taken recently from a 5-megawatt experimental reactor, as well as permit the application of improved inspection technology by UN experts. "If the inter-Korean summit proceeds so well that the Korean peninsula denuclearization declaration and mutual nuclear inspections between South and North Korea become positive issues of discussion, the summit will have a positive influence on the upcoming U.S.-North Korea talks," he observed. Speaking of the Washington-Pyongyang talks in Geneva, Kim said, "North Korea will host on July 8 and the United States the following day. After a break on Sunday (July 10) to receive instructions from their respective home governments, they will sit down again on July 11." While in Washington, Kim will meet the chief American delegate to the Geneva meeting, Robert Gallucci, and Asian Affairs Bureau Director Yutaka Kawashima of Japan's Foreign Ministry, who is also visiting the U.S. capital to discuss the nuclear dispute with North Korea. Kim will return home on July 4.
