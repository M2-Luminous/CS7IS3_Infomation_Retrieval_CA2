FR940913-2-00119 FR940913-2-00081 VI. Administrative Designation and Regulatory Analysis Under Executive Order (EO) 12866, the Agency must judge whether a regulation is ``significant'' and thus subject to OMB review. The decision proposed today is not a regulation, rule or significant regulatory action, as defined in EO 12866; therefore, no OMB review is necessary. VII. Impact on Small Entities Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 through 612, whenever the Agency is required to publish a general notice of rulemaking for any proposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public comment a regulatory flexibility analysis which describes the impact on small entities. Since today's proposed decision does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities, no regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared. VIII. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and implementing regulations, 5 CFR part 1320, do not apply to this action as it does not involve the collection of information as defined therein. Dated: September 6, 1994. Mary D. Nichols, Assistant Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;22586 Filed 9&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P
