FR940228-0-00064 FR940228-0-00015 47 CFR Part 99 [GEN Docket No. 90&hyph;314; FCC 93&hyph;550] Establishment of New Personal Communications Services AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: By this Third Report and Order, the Commission makes final decisions on 50 pioneer's preference requests related to broadband 2 GHz Personal Communications Services (PCS). The Commission awards pioneer's preferences to three applicants and denies the remaining 47 requests. This action guarantees a license to each pioneer in 30 megahertz of spectrum in a Major Trading Area (MTA) if the applicant is otherwise eligible to hold such a license and subject to any changes upon reconsideration in GEN Docket No. 90&hyph;314 that affect service areas or spectrum blocks. The action is intended to appropriately reward the three parties that pioneered new PCS services and technologies. EFFECTIVE DATE: February 28, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This is a summary of the Commission's Third Report and Order adopted December 23, 1993, and released February 3, 1994. This action will not change the public reporting burden.

Summary of Third Report and Order 1. In the Tentative Decision and Memorandum Opinion and Order (Tentative Decision) (57 FR 57458, December 4, 1992) in this proceeding, the Commission proposed to award pioneer's preferences to American Personal Communications (APC), Cox Enterprises, Inc. (Cox), and Omnipoint Communications, Inc. (Omnipoint) and to deny 53 other requests. Subsequently, in the First Report and Order (58 FR 42681, August 11, 1993) in GEN Docket No. 90&hyph;314 and ET Docket No. 92&hyph;100, six of these 53 requests were found to address 900 MHz narrowband services and therefore final action on these six was taken in that proceeding. The Commission adopted final rules for broadband 2 GHz PCS in the Second Report and Order (58 FR 59174, November 8, 1993) in this proceeding. Seven blocks of spectrum were allocated for licensed 2 GHz PCS encompassing 120 megahertz at 1850&hyph;1890, 1930&hyph;1970, 2130&hyph;2150, and 2180&hyph;2200 MHz. Regional and local PCS service areas based upon MTAs and Basic Trading Areas (BTAs) also were adopted. 2. The Commission's pioneer's preference rules provide preferential treatment in its licensing process to parties that demonstrate their responsibility for developing new communications services and technologies. To be granted a pioneer's preference, an applicant must demonstrate that it has developed the new service or technology; e.g. , that it has developed the capabilities or possibilities of the technology or service or has brought them to a more advanced or effective state. The applicant also must demonstrate the technical feasibility of the new service or technology, either by submitting a technical feasibility showing or at least preliminary results of an experiment. Finally, a preference will be granted only if the rules adopted are a reasonable outgrowth of the proposal and lend themselves to grant of a preference. An applicant meeting this standard will be placed on a pioneer's preference track, will not be subject to competing applications, and if otherwise qualified will receive a license. Other applicants will compete for additional licenses on a separate track. The pioneer's preference rules are intended to foster development of new services and improve existing services by reducing the delays and risks innovators otherwise would face with the Commission's licensing process. 3. In the Tentative Decision, the Commission proposed to grant APC, Cox, and Omnipoint a pioneer's preference and to deny 53 requests that is tentatively concluded did not merit preferences. After opportunity for additional comment and replies focused on the Tentative Decision, the Commission found that APC, Cox, and Omnipoint meet the pioneer's preference standard and therefore merit award of preferences; and that the remaining applicants do not meet this standard and therefore do not merit award of preferences.
