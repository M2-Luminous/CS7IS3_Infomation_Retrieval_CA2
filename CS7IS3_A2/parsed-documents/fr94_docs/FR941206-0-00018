FR941206-0-00018 FR941206-0-00001 Paperwork Requirements Manufacturers producing ``meat'' resulting from advances in meat/bone separation machinery that does not grind, crush, or pulverize bone in order to remove skeletal muscle tissues (i.e., meat) adhering to livestock bones are required to maintain records of a compliance program for calcium content that provides the information necessary to assure that the product will meet the requirements as established by this final rule for such product. The paperwork requirements contained in this final rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 0583&hyph;0095. List of Subjects 9 CFR Part 301 Meat inspection. 9 CFR Part 318 Recordkeeping requirements. Meat inspection. 9 CFR Part 320 Meat inspection, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Final Rule For the reasons set forth in the preamble, FSIS is amending 9 CFR parts 301, 318, and 320 of the Federal meat inspection regulations as follows: PART 301_DEFINITIONS 1. The authority citation for part 301 continues to read as follows: Authority: 7 U.S.C. 450, 1901&hyph;1906; 21 U.S.C. 601&hyph;695; 7 CFR 2.17, 2.55. 2. Section 301.2 is amended by revising paragraph (rr) to read as follows: ยง301.2 Definitions. * * * * * (rr) Meat. (1) The part of the muscle of any cattle, sheep, swine, or goats, which is skeletal or which is found in the tongue, in the diaphragm, in the heart, or in the esophagus, with or without the accompanying and overlying fat, and the portions of bone, skin, sinew, nerve, and blood vessels which normally accompany the muscle tissue and which are not separated from it in the process of dressing. It does not include the muscle found in the lips, snout, or ears. This term, as applied to products of equines, shall have a meaning comparable to that provided in this paragraph with respect to cattle, sheep, swine, and goats. (2) The product derived from the mechanical separation of the skeletal muscle tissue from the bones of livestock using the advances in mechanical meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems that do not crush, grind, or pulverize bones, and from which the bones emerge comparable to those resulting from hand-deboning (i.e., essentially intact and in natural physical conformation such that they are recognizable, such as loin bones and rib bones, when they emerge from the machinery) which meets the criteria of no more than 0.15 percent or 150 mg/100 gm of product for calcium (as a measure of bone solids content) within a tolerance of 0.03 percent or 30 mg. * * * * * PART 318_ENTRY INTO OFFICIAL ESTABLISHMENTS: REINSPECTION AND PREPARATION OF PRODUCTS 3. The authority citation for part 318 continues to read as follows: Authority: 7 U.S.C. 450, 1901&hyph;1906; 21 U.S.C. 601&hyph;695; 7 CFR 2.17, 2.55. 4. Part 318 is amended by adding a new ยง318.24 to read as follows: ยง318.24 Compliance procedures for meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems. (a) The product resulting from the separating process shall not have a calcium content exceeding 0.15 percent or 150 mg/100 gm of product within a tolerance of 0.03 percent or 30 mg, as prescribed in ยง301.2(rr)(2) of this subchapter.
