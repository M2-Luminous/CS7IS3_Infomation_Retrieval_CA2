FR941219-0-00028 FR941219-0-00014 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Fish and Wildlife Service 50 CFR Part 17 RIN 1018&hyph;AB66 Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Critical Habitat Determination for the Delta Smelt AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) designates critical habitat for the threatened delta smelt ( Hypomesus transpacificus ) pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act) (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq. ). This final rule designates critical habitat for the delta smelt in the following geographic areas_areas of all water and all submerged lands below ordinary high water and the entire water column bounded by and contained in Suisun Bay (including the contiguous Grizzly and Honker Bays); the length of Goodyear, Suisun, Cutoff, First Mallard (Spring Branch), and Montezuma sloughs; and the existing contiguous waters contained within the Delta, as defined in section 12220 of the California Water Code. Critical habitat designation for the delta smelt will provide additional protection under section 7 of the Act with regard to activities that require Federal agency action. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 18, 1995. ADDRESSES: The complete file for this rule is available for inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Sacramento Field Office, 2800 Cottage Way, Room E&hyph;1803, Sacramento, California 95825&hyph;1846.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Historically, the delta smelt is thought to have occurred from Suisun Bay upstream to the City of Sacramento on the Sacramento River and the City of Mossdale on the San Joaquin River (Moyle et al. 1992). The delta smelt is a euryhaline species (tolerant of a wide salinity range) that spawns in fresh water and has been collected from estuarine waters up to 14 grams per liter (equivalent to ppt) salinity (Moyle et al. 1992). For a large part of its annual life span, this species is associated with the freshwater edge of the mixing zone (zone of mixing or entrapment at the saltwater-freshwater interface), where the salinity is approximately 2 ppt (Ganssle 1966, Moyle et al. 1992, Sweetnam and Stevens 1993). Shortly before spawning, adult delta smelt migrate upstream from the highly productive brackish-water habitat associated with the mixing zone to disperse widely into river channels and tidally-influenced backwater sloughs (Radtke 1966, Moyle 1976, Wang 1991). Delta smelt spawn in shallow, fresh or slightly brackish water upstream of the mixing zone (Wang 1991), mostly in tidally-influenced backwater sloughs and channel edgewaters (Moyle 1976; Wang 1986, 1991; Moyle et al. 1992). Although delta smelt spawning behavior has not been observed in the wild (Moyle et al. 1992), the adhesive eggs are thought to attach to substrates such as cattails and tules, tree roots, and submerged branches (Moyle 1976, Wang 1991). In the Delta, spawning is known to occur in the Sacramento River and in Barker, Lindsey, Cache, Georgiana, Prospect, Beaver, Hog, and Sycamore sloughs (Wang 1991; Dale Sweetnam, pers. comm., 1993). Delta smelt also spawn north of Suisun Bay in Montezuma and Suisun sloughs and their tributaries (Lesa Meng, pers. comm., 1993; Dale Sweetnam, pers. comm., 1993). The spawning season varies from year to year and may occur from late winter (December) to early summer (July and August). Moyle (1976) collected gravid adults from December to April, although ripe delta smelt were most common in February and March. In 1989 and 1990, Wang (1991) estimated that spawning had taken place from mid-February to late June or early July, with the peak spawning period occurring in late April and early May. In 1993, a wet year, spawning may have occurred as early as January and extended into June (Dale Sweetnam, pers. comm., 1994). Peak spawning occurred in April of that year. In 1994, a critically dry year, peak spawning occurred at the end of April, and may have begun as early as late February or early March (Dale Sweetnam, pers. comm., 1994).
