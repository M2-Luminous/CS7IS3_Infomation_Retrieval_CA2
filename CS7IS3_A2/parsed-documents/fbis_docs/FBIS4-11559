The Army has not issued a final toll, but allegedly 28 deaths occurred, according to the latest count. The communique signed by the Secretariat of the General Staff also points out that the military operation took place on the night of 24-25 April, not at dawn on 22 April as reported in the accounts of area residents. They explain that the police operations took place in Raboteau, a Gonaives suburb, to thwart the action of armed individuals who, according to bits of intelligence, were preparing to sabotage public institutions and attack the Artibonite Military Department Headquarters, the premises of the departmental military command. According to the Haitian high command, the Gonaives incident and other recent incidents are the results of the steps of the plan conceived during the meeting in Washington on 21 November 1993 in which some ministers of the resigning government participated. The military institution has renewed its determination to guarantee order and public peace and its firm intent to stop the actions of those who are devoid of the sense of state, institutions, and harmony that must exist within the Haitian family, the text adds. The incident allegedly caused 28 deaths, according to the latest testimony collected by AFP. Most of the victims, over 15, were reached as they were trying to escape by sea. All but two were buried on the spot. As of now, their identities are unknown, they explain. An important exodus occurred after the tragedy. Most of the frightened inhabitants fled the neighborhood, still under high military surveillance, to take refuge in other regions of the city or country. According to the local Justice and Peace Commission of the [Catholic] Church, soldiers shot at residents of the area without warning. The correspondent of a private radio station reported that shots were fired before the arrival of the military.
