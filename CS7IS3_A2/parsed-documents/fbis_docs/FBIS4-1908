At the meeting, Li Youwei, secretary of the Shenzhen City CPC Committee and city mayor, delivered a government report. When reviewing the achievements in various fields of endeavor in 1993 and talking about the work goals and duties in 1994, he said Shenzhen should open wider to both the interior region and the outside world and develop a new pattern. Li said: To open wider to the outside world, Shenzhen should first tighten and improve management at the first and second lines and apply the special policy toward the bonded area fully, satisfactorily, and flexibly. He said: Further efforts should be made to revise and improve the plan for managing the first and second lines to make it more in keeping with reality. It is necessary to step up hardware and software construction in the second line and manage the second line satisfactorily and strictly so as to create conditions and lay a good foundation for implementing the policy toward the bonded area. Li said: The work of designing a bonded area in Yantian Port and submitting it for approval should be accelerated in a bid to start operation this year. Second, it is necessary to reform the port management structure. Li said: With support from the relevant central departments and provincial authorities, Shenzhen will further reform the port management structure, simplify examination procedures, and improve examination equipment to make the port "convenient, highly efficient, safe, and free-flowing." We should gradually establish a port management structure operating according to international practice and in better coordination with the Hong Kong and international markets. We shall strive to practice a 72-hour visa exemption system for foreign tourists coming to the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone. Third, it is necessary to expand the scope and sphere of foreign capital introduction and raise the grade and level of its use. Li Youwei said: Shenzhen should actively create conditions for introducing funds and technology from large multinational corporations and financial groups in Europe, the United States, and other countries, and expand capital introduction to many spheres, such as infrastructure construction, trade, finance, insurance, tourism, and real estate. We shall set up a China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to strengthen leadership over investment invitation.
