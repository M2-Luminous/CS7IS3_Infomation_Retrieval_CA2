FR940407-1-00063 FR940407-1-00012 (A) Adding the total annual dollar cost for all issues of preferred (and preference) stock capital expected to be outstanding as of the beginning of the 12-month period used to compute projected mid-year rate base to the total annual dollar cost for all issues of preferred (and preference) stock capital expected to be outstanding as of the end of the 12-month period, and dividing the resulting sum by two, which yields the average total annual dollar cost of preferred (and preference) stock for all issues for the 12-month period; (B) Adding the total par or stated amount outstanding for all preferred (and preference) stock issues expected to be outstanding as of the beginning of the 12-month period used to compute projected mid-year rate base to the total par or stated amount outstanding for all issues expected to be outstanding as of the end of the 12-month period, and dividing the resulting sum by two, which yields the average total par or stated amount expected to be outstanding for all issues for the 12-month period; (C) Dividing the average total annual dollar cost of preferred (and preference) stock for all issues for the 12-month period by the average total par or stated amount expected to be outstanding for all issues for the 12-month period, which yields the average annual percentage rate cost of preferred (and preference) stock capital for all issues to be used in computing the BTWACC. (v)(A) Cost of preferred (and preference) stock capital calculation (Schedules F&hyph;IV, F&hyph;IV(A), F&hyph;V, and F&hyph;V(A)). The carrier shall calculate the annual percentage rate cost of preferred (and preference) stock capital for all issues of preferred (and preference) stock expected to be outstanding as of the beginning and as of the end of the 12-month period used to compute projected mid-year rate base separately for the two dates, and shall also calculate the average annual percentage rate cost of preferred (and preference) stock for all issues for the 12-month period. The carrier shall support these calculations by showing in tabular form the following for each issue of preferred (and preference) stock as of the beginning and as of the end of the 12-month period separately for the two dates: ( 1 ) Title; ( 2 ) Date of issuance; ( 3 ) Dividend rate (%); ( 4 ) Par or stated amount of issue ($); ( 5 ) Discount or premium ($); ( 6 ) Issuance expense ($); ( 7 ) Net proceeds to the carrier ($); ( 8 ) Net proceeds ratio (%), which is the net proceeds to the carrier divided by the par or stated amount issued; ( 9 ) Cost of money (%), which, for existing preferred (and preference) stock issues, shall be the dividend rate divided by the net proceeds ratio; and, for preferred (and preference) stock issues to be newly issued on or before the final day of the 12-month period, shall be the estimated dividend rate divided by the estimated net proceeds ratio; ( 10 ) Par or stated amount outstanding ($); ( 11 ) Annual cost ($); and ( 12 ) If issue is owned by an affiliate, name and relationship of owner. (B) Where a carrier is a subsidiary of a parent company, the carrier shall show the cost of preferred (and preference) stock calculations and information required in this paragraph (e)(8)(v) for its own preferred (and preference) stock unless the carrier applies for and receives permission from the Commission to use a consolidated capital structure in computing the BTWACC. Where such permission is granted, the subsidiary carrier shall show the required cost of preferred (and preference) stock calculations and information for the consolidated system's preferred (and preference) stock. (vi) In the event that new preferred (and preference) stock is to be issued on or before the final day of the 12-month period used to compute projected mid-year rate base, the carrier shall submit a statement explaining the methods used to estimate information required under paragraph (e)(8)(v)(A) ( 1 ) through ( 12 ). (9) Cost of common-stock equity capital. A carrier's cost of common-stock equity capital shall be calculated using the Discounted Cash Flow (``DCF''), Capital Asset Pricing Model (``CAPM''), and Risk Premium (``RP'') methods. A final estimate of that cost shall be derived from the separate estimates obtained using each of the three methods. (10) DCF method. (i) The DCF model that shall be used in calculating a carrier's cost of common-stock equity is defined algebraically as follows: E:GRAPHICSEP07AP94.014 where: K e is the carrier's cost of common-stock equity capital; D 0 is the carrier's current annualized dividend (defined as four times the current quarterly installment) per share; P 0 is the current market price per share of the carrier's common stock; and g is the constant expected annual rate of growth in the carrier's dividends per share. (ii) Current market price per share of common stock. The current market price per share of the carrier's common stock used in the DCF model shall be an average of the monthly high and low market prices during a six-month period commencing not more than nine months prior to the date on which the proposed rates are filed. (iii) Estimated growth rate of dividends. The estimate of g used in the DCF model shall be an average of three separate estimates obtained using historical growth rate data, professional investment services' projections, and the sustainable growth rate model.
