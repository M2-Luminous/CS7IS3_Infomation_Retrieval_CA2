The powerful business organization made the request as the government began to study measures to regulate exports of such products in line with its policy of preventing proliferation of nuclear and conventional weapons. The government plans to enforce regulations on the basis of a recommendation to be made by the Industrial Structure Council, an advisory body to the minister of international trade and industry. Keidanren said the proposed regulation will have a serious impact on domestic manufacturers, particularly on those who are not familiar with export controls. The federation called on the government to hear views from industries concerned in working out new regulations and give them enough time for familiarization, the officials said.
