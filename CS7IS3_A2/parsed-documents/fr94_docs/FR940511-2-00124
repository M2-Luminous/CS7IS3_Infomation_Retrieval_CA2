FR940511-2-00124 FR940511-2-00081 [Investigation No. 337&hyph;TA&hyph;354] Certain Tape Dispensers; Issuance of General Exclusion Order AGENCY: U.S. International Trade Commission. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission has issued a general exclusion order in the above-captioned investigation. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James M. Lyons, Esq., Office of the General Counsel, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street, SW., Washington, DC 20436, telephone 202&hyph;205&hyph;3094. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The authority for the Commission's determination is contained in section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1337), and in section 210.58 of the Commission's Interim Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR 210.58). Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Corporation (``3M'') filed an amended complaint on June 30, 1993, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1337) alleging that three respondents: (1) Acurite Industries Corp.; (2) Fancy International (HK) Ltd.; and (3) Charles Leonard, Inc., had violated section 337 in the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, or the sale within the United States after importation of certain tape dispensers. The tape dispensers are alleged to infringe a design patent, U.S. Letters Patent Des. 289,180 (the '180 patent). The Commission instituted this investigation by notice published in the Federal Register on July 21, 1993, at 58 FR 39036. The Commission terminated Fancy International as a respondent and added Hoi Fung Industrial Company, Safina Office Products, and Shiang Shin Trading Company as respondents by notice published on November 10, 1993, at 58 FR 59735. The notice of investigation was further amended on January 12, 1994, after a request by 3M to terminate respondent Shiang Shin Trading Company and to change the name of respondent Safina Office Products to Shiang Shin International Inc. d/b/a Safina Office Products. 59 FR 1762&hyph;1763. On December 23, 1993, the presiding administrative law judge (ALJ) issued a final initial determination (``ID'') finding that there was a violation of section 337. The ALJ found that U.S. Letters Patent Des. 289,180 is infringed and that a domestic industry exists with respect to the patent claim in issue. On January 21, 1994, the Commission determined not to review the ID, which thereby became the determination of the Commission. The Commission also requested written submissions concerning the issues of remedy, the public interest, and bonding. 59 FR 3868&hyph;3869 (January 27, 1994). On April 5, 1994, the Commission made its determinations on the issues of remedy, the public interest, and bonding. The Commission determined that the appropriate form of relief is a general exclusion order prohibiting the importation of infringing tape dispensers. Finally, the Commission determined that the public interest factors enumerated in 19 U.S.C. 1337 (d), (f), and (g) do not preclude the issuance of the aforementioned relief, and that the bond during the Presidential review period shall be in the amount of 220 percent of the entered value of the infringing tape dispensers. Copies of the Commission order, the Commission opinion in support thereof, and all other nonconfidential documents filed in connection with this investigation are or will be available for inspection during official business hours (8:45 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.) in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street, SW., Washington, DC 20436, telephone 202&hyph;205&hyph;2000. Hearing-impaired persons are advised that information on the matter can be obtained by contacting the Commission's TDD terminal on 202&hyph;205&hyph;1810. Issued: May 3, 1994. By order of the Commission. Donna R. Koehnke, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;11475 Filed 5&hyph;10&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7020&hyph;02&hyph;P
