According to the communique, the state of democratic law does not allow a confrontation among the branches of the Republic "under penalty of an institutional crisis of serious internal and external consequences." In the following paragraph, the Senate notes that it is appropriate for the press to criticize or praise the actions of the three branches of government and correct possible mistakes. The communique says: "It is not correct, however, to use the media to foment animosities that may compromise the institutions." The communique also recalls that Congress did not fail to support the government, and approved the economic program. The communique, signed by Congress President Senator Humberto Lucena (PMDB-PB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Paraiba State]), notes that nothing will justify a diversion from championing the "system of responsible rights, our country's supreme legal and social good, rights that are actually based on respect for independence and harmony among the three branches of government." The communique concludes with a call for common sense to prevail, with negotiations by the president of the Republic, "who, under a presidential system of government, is entitled to conduct our country's political-administrative process."
