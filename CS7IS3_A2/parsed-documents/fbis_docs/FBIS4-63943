The information that Ulmanis was a secret agent dubbed Hugo was given to the newspaper by a former Soviet Union KGB (Committee for National Security) employee, the paper's publisher Shaaban Hafiz Shaaban told BNS by telephone. Shaaban, who is a Jordanian citizen, claimed that the information was "absolutely reliable" because the paper's staff had an opportunity to look into the respective documents, testifying Ulmanis' linkage to the notorious structure. The name of the article's author, Ainars Vagris, is a pseudonym of a Russian-Latvian, Shaaban said. As many as 3,000 copies of the AL-KODS newspaper are circulated in Latvia. The newspaper's title means "The Sacred City" and it aims, according to its motto, to "combat Zionism and its impact on the world politics and economy; to liberate Palestine from Zionist gangs." The Moscow Chamber of Information Disputes said May 19 that AL-KODS was an unlawfully registered publication because the respective Russian laws barred foreign citizens from publishing activities. To protest the article, the Latvian prosecutor general sent his Russian counterpart a letter on May 18 describing the publication as libel and injury to the honor and dignity of the Latvian president and the entire Latvian state institution. Ulmanis himself has assessed the article as unprecedent provocation against the Latvian president and the Latvian state.
