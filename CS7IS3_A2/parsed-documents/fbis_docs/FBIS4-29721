At a conference organized last week by Chulalongkon University and attended by top officials from the Thai Foreign Office and National Security Council, Om and his deputy, Un Noeng, discussed Cambodia's position in the region a year after the May 1993 elections. Om represents the royalist Funcinpec [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] party of King Norodom Sihanouk. Noeng is a member of the opposition Cambodian People's Party of Hun Sen. They represent the two largest parties in the new national parliament created when the new constitution was ratified last September. Om was more confident about the future than recent press reports on the Cambodian situation have suggested. "I would prefer to say that we have challenges in Cambodia and not problems", he said. He went on to outline the need for economic stability.and growth, long term economic management, and the encouragement of private enterprise. Despite being on opposite sides of the political divide, both men were united in the desire to encourage direct foreign investment in their country. They stressed that Parliament was working on the National Plan for Reconstruction and Development which has the support of the United Nations Development Programme. Both men denied that the continued hostilities between the Phnom Penh government and the Khmer Rouge were an obstacle to investment, and Om invited the international community to visit Cambodia "in order to see for themselves". Noeng claimed the Khmer Rouge controlled only 5-10 percent of Cambodian territory, and that moves were underway to merge and reform the security forces of the major factions. "If one has been ill for 20 years, one cannot be cured in one hour, but the patient is able to tell you that the medicine is working," said Om. Using the rhetoric of `national reconciliation', a veiled metaphor usually understood to mean inclusion of the Khmer Rouge in the governing process, both parliamentarians claimed that with the development of a human rights policy and with sustainable economic growth, the Khmer Rouge problem could be solved through integration rather than suppression . This position directly contradicts a motion currently tabled by MPs seeking to outlaw and condemn the Khmer Rouge and follows the policy of reconciliation inconsistently promoted by King Sihanouk over recent years. The chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee also hinted that Cambodia may in the future play a more involved role in regional economic development, in addition to be coming a member of the Asean Parliamentary Union and acting as an observer at full Asean meetings. "It takes time to be member of these important organisations, but I say to you also that Cambodia will play real role not only in the development but also in the security of the region," said Om. Co-operation with Thailand was also seen as crucial to Cambodia's future, and Om brushed aside rumours of link between the Thai Army and the Khmer Rouge. The other nations of Southeast Asia were requested to help with technological change such as skill training and education. Om concluded by expressing the wish that Cambodia an the Asean nations could "try to have a common interest for the next century, for the year 2000."
