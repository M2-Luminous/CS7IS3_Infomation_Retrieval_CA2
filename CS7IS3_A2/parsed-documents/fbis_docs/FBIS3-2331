According to the circular, surplus military land must be developed in a planned way and under organized leadership. The army units which transfer their surplus military land must, as required by the relevant state regulations, register with the local land administration department at the county level and above for the change in the land-use right, so that they will be exempted from paying charges for transferring land. The proceeds from transferring and leasing surplus military land are collected by the General Logistics Department and then put into a special account and only used as designated. The "Circular" also provides that the state will not require the land users to donate to the budget adjustment fund and the fund for key construction projects including energy and transportation.
