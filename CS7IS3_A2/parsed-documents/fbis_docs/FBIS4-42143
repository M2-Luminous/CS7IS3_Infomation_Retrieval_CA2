In Seoul the South Korean Government called on the North to stop the controversial refuelling at the five-megawatt Yongbyon reactor, warning that the situation could degenerate into a crisis. The IAEA issued a statement confirming that North Korea had refused to allow its inspectors to check that no fuel was being diverted to make nuclear weapons. "The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) rejected all IAEA proposals put forward with the aim of maintaining the IAEA's ability to select, segregate and secure fuel rods for later measurements so as to be able to verify the history of the reactor core, specifically to verify whether this is the first core," the statement said. "The DPRK continued to maintain that it could not accept the IAEA verification measures proposed." It said two senior Agency members who had travelled to North Korea would return to Vienna Saturday, but that two other inspectors would remain behind to further developments. IAEA Director General Hans Blix said earlier in a letter to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali that North Korea had resumed refuelling at the Yongbyon reactor, defying the international inspectors and making it impossible to make a full accounting of weapons-grade fuel.
