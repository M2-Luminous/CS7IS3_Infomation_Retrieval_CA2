[Begin Rodriguez recording] Generally speaking, the country, as well as Havana Province, should substantially reduce its budget deficit -- particularly at the national level -- this year. However, a certain level of deficit will nevertheless prevail because we cannot possibly reduce last year's figure, meaning $4.2 billion, to zero in a single year. The government has yet to approve the budget but we will have a deficit. Generally speaking, the measures adopted in the assembly to reduce the deficit have a lot in common with what is being done in the rest of the country. The measures are mainly aimed at reducing subsidies to the enterprises, which is one of the essential elements of the country's deficit, and seeking a greater effectiveness in the production sector. This is a short-term element on which work can be readily carried out to cut losses, increase reliability, and achieve profits -- as much as possible -- in enterprises that are currently unprofitable. [end recording] Workers propose measures during the parliaments. Some of the measures will be popular but others will not. Jose Luis Rodriguez refers to these measures: [Begin Rodriguez recording] Certainly, as we have explained, the National Assembly of the People's Government is trying to adopt a series of measures that, although they will strive not to leave unprotected any citizen in the country, certain measures imply -- as our commander in chief explained -- sacrifices for the population. The people should rest assured the measures will be implemented with the greatest criteria of social justice possible and they will bear in mind the working people's interests. They will also include measures against those who violate the working people's interests. [end recording] The consultation with the Cuban workers, called the workers' parliament, will end on 15 March.
