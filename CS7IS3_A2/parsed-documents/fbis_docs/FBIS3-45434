Wang Tao, president of China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC), unveiled the second round of international bidding here today. The first round for exploring oil and gas in the Tarim Basin in China's remote Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region ended last year. An initial petroleum contract has been signed between the CNPC and the Exxon and the Japan Oil Company group. More commercial negotiations are under way. Wang said the projects now open to foreign bidding fall into two categories -- risk exploration and enhanced oil recovery projects. Registration will begin on February 15, 1994. In the first category, 26 exploration blocks in China's nine provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions of Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Hubei, Gansu, Qinghai and Tianjin are inviting foreign bids. According to Wang, oil resources in these blocks with a total area of 216,000 square kilometers are estimated at 6.2 billion tons and natural gas resources at 800 billion cubic meters. "This indicates a good prospect for exploration," Wang said. He added that most blocks are located near industrial and agricultural centers with convenient transportation infrastructures, which will surely facilitate operations there. Wang assured that international conventions and formulas for product-sharing will be adopted in this round of bidding as in the previous one. Foreign companies will be solely responsible for all exploration risks in the contract blocks. Commercial discoveries will be jointly developed by Chinese and foreign partners while post-tax profits will be shared in accordance with the terms and conditions set in the contracts. Wang said the second category covers enhanced oil recovery projects in 11 developed blocks scattered in the eight mature oil fields of Shengli, Dagang, Huabei, Jianghan, Henan, Jiangsu, Zhongyuan and Jilin. Total oil-bearing area in the blocks is 190.2 square kilometers with oil reserves of 380 million tons in place. The recovery factor in these blocks varies from 18.3 to 85.3 percent of the recoverable reserves, Wang told the conference. Located within developed fields, with reliable resources, complete infrastructures and guaranteed logistic support, these projects are expected to be quick to produce results. In the projects, foreign companies will shoulder risks alone, or together with the Chinese side, for pilot tests. The two sides will be joint operators after stimulation methods are chosen and share the incremental increases in oil following tax payment. Wang said foreign companies are free to forward their tenders individually or to bid through the formation of consortiums. The registered foreign companies will start data review, purchase data packages and make field trips from March 1 to August 1, 1994. The bidding is scheduled to end on August 30, 1994, followed by bid evaluation. Wang said China is looking for overseas cooperation in downstream utilization of oil and gas, construction of long-distance oil and gas pipelines and manufacturing of special petroleum equipment as well as engineering and technical services. It will also seek foreign partners to explore and develop oil and gas resources outside China, Wang added.
