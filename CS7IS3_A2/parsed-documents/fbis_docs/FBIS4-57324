Meanwhile, the tourists returned last night on a commercial flight from Managua. The capture of the yachts was downplayed by Costa Rican President Jose Figueres, who said it was "an unfortunate incident" that is a "residue of the more tense relations" Costa Rica and Nicaragua have experienced in the recent past. The Nicaraguan military released yesterday eight persons -- five U.S. tourists and three Costa Rican crew members -- who were arrested by the EPS in the Barra del Colorado (Costa Rica) coasts, 240 km northeast of San Jose, while they were sports fishing. Meanwhile, two "Navajo" aircraft sent by the Costa Rica Expeditions tour company, owner of one of the yachts, remained in Nicaragua because "fuel had to be transported from here (Costa Rica), as the military did not supply us," company executive Javier Salazar told ACAN. The aircraft transported from Bluefields [Nicaragua] company personnel and reporters "who had to return on a commercial flight last night from Managua," with the released tourists, Salazar assured. The company executive said the Nicaraguan immigration authorities released the tourists and the crew "without any type of explanation." All those involved in the incident from the Costa Rican side said that the capture took place in Costa Rican waters off the Barra del Colorado coast, in the Caribbean. The Nicaraguan military version indicates that the tourists were in Nicaraguan jurisdiction, 10 miles north of the border with Costa Rica. Therefore, they proceeded to arrest them. The detained, all U.S. citizens, were identified by Costa Rican police as Ted Mucium, Frank Vanderburght, Brian Brouckaert, and Erick and Parl Becker. They were travelling on the yachts "Bull Shark" and "Guapote," commandeered by Costa Ricans Luis Torres, Wally Wallace, and Roberto Graund.
