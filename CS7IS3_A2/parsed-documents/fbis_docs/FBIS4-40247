Two drafts of amendments had been put forward, one by the commission for issues of legal policy, judicial, and legal reform, chaired by Volodymyr Stretovych of the "Agrarians of Ukraine" grouping; and the other by the commission for issues of nation building, council activities, and self-government, chaired by Oleksandr Steshenko of the Communist grouping. Differences on positions of principle in them made sure the debate was heated. Virtually all amendments, proposed by the commission for issues of nation building, council activities, and self-government, were passed by a majority vote. Most disagreement emerged in discussing the following articles: - Article 4, stipulating that chairmen of councils at all levels, including towns' rayon councils and their executive committees, be accountable and responsible to the relevant councils. In matters of exercising the state executive authority powers delegated to them, they are subordinate to the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and the chairman of the executive committee at a council of a higher level. The commission for legal policy, judicial, and legal reform was insistent a provision on subordination to the Ukrainian president also be added to this article. - Article 3, under which both the relevant council's deputies and individuals who are not deputies can be members of an executive committee. This amendment is effectively in breach of Article 85 of Ukraine's Constitution, where it is ruled that a deputy cannot be a member of an executive council. The view of some of the deputies is that the appropriate amendment can also be put forward in the course of examining the draft Law "On Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers" and amendments to the Law "On the President of Ukraine", which it is planned will be considered this week. Appeals by deputies from the groupings of Rukh, "Reforms," "Statehood," Interregional Deputies Group, and others to Oleksandr Tkachenko, Supreme Council of Ukraine first deputy chairman, who was chairing the sitting, did not encounter support. - Article 8, saying that after the election of deputies and chairmen of all levels and the formation of executive committees at councils, the Law of Ukraine "On a representative of the Ukrainian president" shall become invalid and the powers of oblast, Kiev and Sevastopol municipal, rayon, Kiev and Sevastopol municipal rayon, and local administrations shall be transferred to the relevant councils' chairmen and executive committees. The commission for legal policy, judicial, and legal reform proposed that added to this article be a provision that, in the event that elections fail to be held, or were considered not to take place, or there are any breaches of the legislation, local administrations carry on exercising their powers temporarily until the holding of new elections. The amendment was not passed, which gave its authors, notably Rukh's Oleksandr Lavrynovych, reasons to state that Ukraine was thus deprived of its state representative in Crimea as, indeed, it was possible that elections there would fail to take place. In token of protest against these decisions being passed, some deputies of national democratic orientation left the session's chamber and did not vote on the changes to the law as a whole. Serhiy Sobolyev of the "Reforms" grouping has officially requested the Ukrainian president not to sign this law as it was passed knowingly in breach of Ukraine's current Constitution.
