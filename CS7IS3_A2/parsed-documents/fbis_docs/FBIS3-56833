The only way for Russia unambiguously to demonstrate its respect for Estonia's sovereignty and independence is to meet its international commitments, specifically by meeting the provisions of the July 1992 CSCE final document in which Russia pledged to complete the unconditional, rapid and orderly withdrawal of its troops from Estonian territory. It is clear from these and previous Russian statements that Russia does not take continued Baltic independence very seriously. Baltic independence is viewed as a temporary annoyance. [Russian Foreign Minister] Kozyrev has again expressed the Russian policy of "eminent domain." Balts have long warned about the practical implications of concepts such as "near abroad," "special interests," "sphere of Russian interests for centuries." When Hitler announced his plans, the world powers did not take him seriously at first. The West set out on a path of appeasement which led to world war. Are we really doomed to repeat history? A bite of Baltics will not fill the bear's stomach -- it will merely whet his appetite. Clinton has turned into Bush and Kozyrev turns out to be Zhirinovskiy. Kozyrev: "Certain elements in those regions (CIS and Baltics) constitute a major threat to those (Russian) interests." Is Kozyrev referring to the democratically elected governments of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania? Will we now hear demands for the resignation of some or all of the Baltic leaders to be replaced by individuals more "friendly" to Russia???? When have we heard things like this before?!? Russia has not lived up to its international commitments and obligations, especially on the issue of withdrawing troops (Helsinki Final Document, 1992). In a form of appeasement, the West has not exerted enough pressure to bring this about. As a result, Russia, instead of behaving as a responsible partner in the world community, is now making expansionistic, destabilizing threats. Clinton's message was fuzzy and seemed to allow conditions to be attached to troop withdrawal, the Russians have now been emboldened. Russia has no real concern for the Russian-speaking residents in other nations. Those poor people are merely being used as a political tool. The tragic aspect to all this is that resentment may grow against these people since Russian threats will cause them to be viewed as a potential fifth column wherever they reside. IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO MAKE RUSSIA STOP. A CLEAR, SHARP REACTION FROM THE WEST TO THIS LATEST MOVE WILL MAKE RUSSIA PULL BACK AND SAY, "NO, NO, YOU'VE MISUNDERSTOOD. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE MEANT AT ALL."
