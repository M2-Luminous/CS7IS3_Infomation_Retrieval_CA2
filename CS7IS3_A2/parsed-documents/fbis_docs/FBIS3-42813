Is it necessary to mention what an enormous role this has been called upon to play in providing assistance to the working individual, improving his health and treating him? As long as trade unions managed Russia's Social Insurance Fund, it completely coped with these goals. Last year, as is known, an edict of the Russian Federation's president transferred the fund's management to the government "with the participation of the all-Russian trade unions." At the time, RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA and other publications warned the people: This document unties the hands of the executive branch's civil servants to patch holes in the state budget using social insurance, as has already occurred with the pension fund. Seemingly, this forecast has started to come true. On 17 January, Yuriy Shatyrenko, the fund's chairman, adopted a decree without considering the opinion of the trade unions and the board of directors. It ordered them to abolish the fund's separate central branch departments and transfer the property, which had been acquired using social insurance assets, to the fund's central executive board of directors. On 21 January, this same Yu. Shatyrenko sent a teletype message to the heads of the regional administrations about suspending the issuing of joint stock in the trade unions' sanitarium and health resort system. It is impossible to call the actions of the Social Insurance Fund's leadership anything other than arbitrariness since they were completely contrary to a whole series of legal acts. We will mention only the main ones. In the new Russian Federation Constitution, it is written: "Any normative legal acts affecting the rights, freedoms and duties of the individual and citizen cannot be applied if they have not been published officially for general information." The Social Insurance Fund decree has not been published. Let us also recall the president's edict, according to which, first, the new procedure for managing social insurance is called a temporary one -- until the Federal Assembly adopts special legislation. Second, management was entrusted to two subjects possessing equal rights: the government and the trade unions. Third, it was also ordered that "the existing procedure for paying state social insurance and for financing expenditures for these purposes should be retained in enterprises, establishments, organizations, and other economic agencies regardless of the form of ownership until legislation is adopted." In other words, the procedure for paying through branch and regional departments of the Social Insurance Fund of the all-Russian trade unions should exist even today because nothing else existed at the time the president's edict was published. Conclusion: The fund's new masters have displayed not only an extreme lack of respect for the country's constitution, which has direct effect, but also for their management partners -- the trade unions -- and, in them, for millions of workers also. Mikhail Shmakov, the chairman of the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia, and Vyacheslav Goncharov, his deputy, who were alarmed by this development of events, met with Yu. Shatyrenko, chairman of the Russian Federation's Social Insurance Fund. A joint teletype message was sent to the heads of the local administrations and the directors of the regional trade associations as a result of the discussions. It informed them that the fund was retracting its claims to the property of the trade unions' sanitarium and health resort installations. The directors of the branch trade unions, which are in the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia, unanimously spoke out in their meeting also for abrogating the fund chairman's decree of 17 January. Word for Word Mikhail Shmakov, chairman of the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia, said during the discussion of the critical situation that had been created: "The leadership of the Social Insurance Fund and its chairman, Yu. Shatyrenko, assume that trade union activists have been so occupied with current social insurance matters on social principles that they will not continue further. No, it is necessary to continue the situation to the end: If the reorganized fund assumes all management and threatens another's property -- let it not count on us. Let it establish a new machinery whose size will increase by far. It will barely live on the percentages, which are withheld from wages for social insurance. Nothing will remain for payments. "Let them know in the fund that our protest is not a mutiny by the Federation of Independent Trade Union of Russia leaders. The boycott will be universal -- from the top to the bottom. "We will invite Yu. Shatyrenko to visit us and we will put the question to him point-blank: Either he revokes his decrees or we will be forced to look for other ways."
