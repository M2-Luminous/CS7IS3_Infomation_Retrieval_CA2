The program provides for the appropriation of up to 2 million dollars to five state companies to make them competitive. The Lithuanian Economics Ministry says the program has come too late and should have been put into effect about a year and a half ago. The main reason for this is the lack of medium-sized and still opportune enterprises, because the Reconstruction Bank does not want to finance very large companies.
