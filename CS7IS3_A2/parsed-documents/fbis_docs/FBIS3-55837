Talks on Troop Withdrawal Have Been Resumed"] [Text] According to the Baltic News Service, President Yeltsin "does not intend to react officially" to the 10 January incident in Latvia. Nonetheless yesterday the Russian president's press secretary Kostikov came out with a sharp statement on this score. In the future Russia will take into account the "U.S. experience" of reacting in similar situations, Vyacheslav Kostikov said. In the press secretary's opinion, should such excesses be repeated, "the reaction by the president and Russia may be tougher, I would say, very tough indeed, based on world precedents." Thereby the incident involving the detention in Riga of two Russian generals and the capture of Russian military installations has presumably been exhausted. In spite of threatening statements by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Defense Ministry, and the Russian Federation Embassy in Latvia issued Monday evening, yesterday bilateral talks on the pullout of Russian troops resumed in the Latvian capital. Moreover, the Russian delegation offered to reduce the term of temporary operation of the radar station in Skrunda from six to five years. At the same time, the head of the Russian delegation, Ambassador at Large Sergey Zotov, described the action by the Latvian self-defense forces as "a gross provocation by extremist and nationalist forces aimed at torpedoing the Russian-Latvian negotiations" and also as "a test of Russia's force and its ability to defend its installations against attack." It needs to be recognized that the test has been impressive. According to Russian Federation Defense Minister Grachev, not only the troops deployed in Latvia but also units of the Pskov airborne division were put on alert. The Russian demarches have produced an appropriate effect. Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis officially apologized to Russia. The Latvian Prosecutor's Office has initiated criminal proceedings over the detention of the generals. Andreys Ruchs, chairman of the Vidzemskiy district, who was in charge of this action, has been dismissed from his post.
