It was attended by Pak Song-chol, Politburo member of the C.C. [Central Committee], the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] and vice president of the DPRK, Kim Yong-sun, secretary of the C.C., the WPK, Chang Chol, vice-premier of the Administration Council, and other senior officials, 10,000 citizens and Koreans from abroad. South Korean students and people rose up in a mass uprising in Kwangju on May 18, 1980, fought "martial law troops" and armed themselves with the weapons they wrested from the enemy and completely controlled and defended Kwangju city for more than ten days. The heroic resistance involved more than a million students and citizens. In his speech at the rally, Kang Hyon-su, member of the C.C., the WPK and chief secretary of the Pyongyang Municipal Party Committee and chairman of the Pyongyang Municipal People's Committee, said the Kwangju popular uprising was a just anti-U.S., anti-fascist democratic resistance of the South Korean people who turned out against the U.S. imperialists' colonial rule and the extension of the "Yusin" fascist dictatorship and for the democratization of society and the reunification of the country and a mass armed uprising in which the entire citizens of Kwangju waged a death-defying resistance in the teeth of fascist violence. The U.S. imperialists transferred 70,000 puppet troops, 150 tanks and armored vehicles under their command to the military fascists to put down the uprising. In some ten days, the South Korean military fascist clique killed more than 5,000 people and injured 14,000. "Through the Kwangju popular uprising, the South Korean people clearly learned that U.S. imperialism is the strangler of independence and democracy and the chieftain of aggression and murder and gained at the cost of blood the lesson that no desires could be realised as long as the U.S. imperialist aggression forces remain in South Korea," said the speaker. He said that with the traitor Kim Yong-sam left intact, the bitter grudges of the Kwangju resistance fighters cannot be settled and there will be nothing but confrontation and war between fellow countrymen. The earnest desire of the participants of the Kwangju uprising for independence, democracy and reunification must be realised without fail, he added. The speaker continued: "As long as the U.S. Forces remain in South Korea and the U.S. colonial rule continues, no desire of the South Korean people can be realised. "The United States must make a bold decision to withdraw its aggressor troops and nuclear weapons from South Korea in accordance with the trend of the times and the demand of our nation and approach the DPRK-USA talks with a sincere attitude and position for a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. "It is our unshakable position to answer dialogue with dialogue and war with war. "The United States must clearly see the indomitable will and stamina of our people and stop the campaign over `nuclear issue' aimed at stifling Korean-style socialism centred on the masses. "The United States must accede to our proposal for establishing a new peace arrangement since the Korean Armistice Agreement has been reduced to a sheet of paper incapable of preserving peace on the Korean peninsula and the military armistice commission cannot perform its mission due to her illegalities. "The South Korean students and people must wage a powerful mass struggle in all areas for the abolition of the `National Security Law' and other fascist laws and all repressive machines and courageously fight to overthrow the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime and establish a genuine independent democratic government of the people." Representatives of various social strata also took the floor. They all stressed that the South Korean people must undauntedly wage the anti-U.S. struggle for independence to terminate the colonial rule of the United States, achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the country and realise what the participants of the Kwangju uprising desired.
