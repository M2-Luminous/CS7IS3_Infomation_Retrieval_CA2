FR940902-2-00128 FR940902-2-00053 When a master servicer advances funds, the amount so advanced is recoverable by the servicer out of future payments on receivables held by the trust to the extent not covered by credit support. However, where the master servicer provides credit support to the trust, there are protections in place to guard against a delay in calling upon the credit support to take advantage of the fact that the credit support declines proportionally with the decrease in the principal amount of the obligations in the trust as payments on receivables are passed through to investors. These safeguards include: (a) There is often a disincentive to postponing credit losses because the sooner repossession or foreclosure activities are commenced, the more value that can be realized on the security for the obligation; (b) The master servicer has servicing guidelines which include a general policy as to the allowable delinquency period after which an obligation ordinarily will be deemed uncollectible. The pooling and servicing agreement will require the master servicer to follow its normal servicing guidelines and will set forth the master servicer's general policy as to the period of time after which delinquent obligations ordinarily will be considered uncollectible; (c) As frequently as payments are due on the receivables included in the trust (usually monthly or quarterly as set forth in the pooling and servicing agreement), the master servicer is required to report to the independent trustee the amount of all past-due payments and the amount of all servicer advances, along with other current information as to collections on the receivables and draws upon the credit support. Further, the master servicer is required to deliver to the trustee annually a certificate of an executive officer of the master servicer stating that a review of the servicing activities has been made under such officer's supervision, and either stating that the master servicer has fulfilled all of its obligations under the pooling and servicing agreement or, if the master servicer has defaulted under any of its obligations, specifying any such default. The master servicer's reports are reviewed at least annually by independent accountants to ensure that the master servicer is following its normal servicing standards and that the master servicer's reports conform to the master servicer's internal accounting records. The results of the independent accountants' review are delivered to the trustee; and (d) Credit support will be provided based upon a specified percentage of the aggregate initial principal balance of the receivables included in the trust. The credit support is a fixed dollar amount, subject to reduction only for actual draws thereon, throughout the life of the trust. As a result (subject to draws thereon), the amount of this credit support will increase as a percentage of the pool principal during the life of the trust. The Applicants represent that this approach thereby provides investors with greater protection than the approach which permits proportionate reductions in the credit support, subject to a floor which only is effective towards the end of the life of the trust.
