These clashes claimed the lives of dozens of innocent citizens. Many people from both sides were also killed or wounded. In the past two days, the Talabani group attempted to attack the elements and centers of the clique of the so-called Islamic Movement in Halabjah and nearby areas. The group, however, achieved nothing. It recently cut the power supply of this area, which is fed by power generators from the city of al-Sulaymaniyah. The Talabani group said that Hasan Kuwistani [name as received], Political Bureau member of Talabani's party, and seven other party members were killed in the Hajj 'Umran sector, and that the killers mutilated his body and used a car to pull it before people in Hajj 'Umran.
