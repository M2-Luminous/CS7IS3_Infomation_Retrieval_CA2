FR940926-0-00078 FR940926-0-00015 Section 91.119 prescribes minimum altitudes for airplanes and helicopters that provide for the protection of persons and property on the surface. Generally, a pilot may not operate below an altitude allowing, if power failure occurs, an emergency landing without undue hazard to persons or property on the surface. Helicopters may be operated at lower altitudes than airplanes if the operation is conducted without hazard to persons or property on the surface and the pilot can conduct a safe emergency landing in the event of power failure. Under ideal conditions, a helicopter, unlike an airplane, can land at or near zero forward speed, provided the landing area is relatively level and free of obstructions. Factors that make an emergency landing site unsuitable include obstacles, rugged terrain, congested areas and water. Obstacles range from natural terrain features and trees to buildings and utility towers with wires strung between them. A major factor affecting safety of flight in any single engine aircraft at low altitude is the limited choice of suitable emergency landing areas. Hawaii's unique topography_active volcanoes spewing hot molten lava, sharp cliffs, cascading waterfalls, rugged coastlines, mist-shrouded mountains, dense tropical rainforests and deep, closed canyons_often complicates access to suitable emergency landing areas. The air tour accidents in Hawaii indicate that helicopter pilots have had insufficient time to locate suitable landing areas after engine power loss or other problems leading to accidents. Based on the recent escalation of accidents caused by unsafe operating practices, and the fact that voluntary measures are insufficient, the FAA is implementing this emergency final rule as Special Federal Regulation (SFAR) No. 71. The Special Federal Aviation Regulation The FAA is promulgating these requirements in an SFAR, rather than a general rule, to address the unique problems associated with the Hawaiian air tour operating environment. This emergency regulatory action establishes additional operating procedures, including minimum safe altitudes (and associated increases in visual flight rules (VFR) weather minimums), minimum equipment requirements, and operational limitations for air tour aircraft in the State of Hawaii. Applicability and Definitions This SFAR applies to parts 91 and 135 air tour operators in the State of Hawaii (section 1). In section 2, ``air tour'' is defined as any VFR sightseeing flight conducted in an airplane or helicopter for compensation or hire. ``Air tour operator'' is defined as any person who conducts an air tour. Flotation Devices The SFAR requires that any single-engine air tour helicopter flown beyond the shore of any island must be amphibious or equipped with emergency floats and approved flotation gear easily accessible for each occupant, or that each person on board the helicopter wear approved flotation gear. An amphibious helicopter or one equipped with floats will allow a safe emergency ditching. This requirement is specific to helicopters because helicopters, unlike airplanes, may sink rapidly after forced landings on water. These requirements should reduce the risk of drowning, such as the deaths that occurred on January 25, 1993, when a helicopter, operating under part 91, crashed in deep water while on a sightseeing flight to view molten lava flowing into the ocean off the coast of Volcanoes National Park. Before the accident, the pilot had been hovering near the shoreline between 100 and 150 feet above sea level. When the pilot attempted to resume forward flight, he experienced a total left pedal failure. The pilot lost control and the helicopter landed in the ocean and sank. The helicopter was not equipped with flotation devices, and the pilot and four passengers were not wearing lifevests. Only the pilot survived. The NTSB found that a factor which contributed to the passengers' fatal injuries was the operator's failure to provide lifevests to the passengers. In a July 14, 1994, accident, an air tour helicopter with seven people on board made a forced landing in the Pacific Ocean after losing power off Kauai's Na Pali Coast. Three passengers swam to shore and another was rescued from the water. The pilot and two other passengers drowned. The helicopter was not equipped with flotation devices, and the passengers did not have sufficient time to don the lifevests on board the helicopter. Later, on the same day, a different air tour helicopter made a forced landing after losing power off the north coast of Molokai. All persons aboard the helicopter swam to shore and were rescued the next day. The helicopter was equipped with flotation devices, and the pilot and passengers had sufficient time to don the lifevests. Flotation equipment on a helicopter should allow the helicopter to remain afloat long enough for the persons to egress safely; the individual flotation gear should allow the survivors an opportunity to swim to shore or to be picked up by rescue personnel. Flotation equipment/lifevests helped to ensure the survival of the passengers in the second accident on July 14. The FAA is considering changing the rule to require that all single-engine helicopters conducting air tour operations beyond the shore of any island be amphibious or fitted with flotation devices. Therefore, the FAA is requesting comments on this possibility. At the close of the comment period, the FAA will analyze the comments received and, based on its analysis, determine if further rulemaking is necessary.
