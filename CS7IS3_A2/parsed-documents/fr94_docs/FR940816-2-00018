FR940816-2-00018 FR940816-2-00014 12. Toro failed to report information concerning gas tank seam failures on ``L'' series mowers to the Commission in a timely manner as required by section 15(b) of the CPSA, as amended, 15 U.S.C. §2064(b). The ``M'' Series Lawn Mowers 13. During 1989 and 1990, Lawn-Boy manufactured and distributed ``M'' series lawn mowers that experienced gas tank leakage. The method of mounting and attaching the tanks to the mower engines resulted in wear on the tanks that caused the tanks to fail and leak. Lawn-Boy received complaints of leakage after its acquisition by Toro, redesigned the mounting system, and, in 1990, included redesigned brackets and tanks in an ``upgrade kit'' to be installed by Lawn-Boy distributors and dealers on ``M'' series mowers brought in for service. 14. In its capacity as the corporate parent of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Lawn-Boy, Toro knew, or with the exercise of due diligence, should have known that the method of mounting the tanks caused wear on the tanks and could expose consumers to a substantial risk of injury from fire. Despite the pattern of tank failures, Toro failed to provide any information concerning the failures to the Commission until a Commission investigator inspected Lawn-Boy in November, 1990. 15. Toro failed to report information relating to gas tank failures on the ``M'' series lawn mowers to the Commission in a timely manner as required by section 15(b) of the CPSA, as amended, 15 U.S.C. §2064(b). The ``Model 8157'' Series Lawn Mowers 16. In 1987 and 1988, Lawn-Boy manufactured and distributed Model 8157 series lawn mowers. In 1989, Lawn-Boy received complaints that the gas tanks on these lawn mowers were experiencing gas leakage as a result of fractures in the fuel tank nipples. In 1990, a revised fuel tank nipple was incorporated in replacement tanks for the Model 8157 series. 17. In its capacity as the corporate parent of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Lawn-Boy, Toro knew, or, with the exercise of due diligence, should have known that gas tank fuel nipples were fracturing and could expose consumers to a substantial risk of injury from fire. Despite the pattern of tank failures, Toro failed to provide any information concerning the failures to the Commission until a Commission investigator inspected Lawn-Boy in November, 1990. 18. Toro failed to report information relating to gas tank failures on the Model 8157 series lawn mowers to the Commission in a timely manner as required by section 15(b) of the CPSA, as amended, 15 U.S.C. §2064(b). V. Response of Toro 19. Toro denies each and all of the staff allegations with respect to the mowers identified in this agreement. Further, Toro denies the allegations that the Lawn-Boy ``L'' series lawn mowers identified in paragraph 9 of this agreement, the ``M'' series lawn mowers identified in paragraph 13, and the ``Model 8157'' series lawn mowers identified in paragraph 16 contained defects which created or could have created a substantial product hazard within the meaning of section 15(a) of the CPSA, 15 U.S.C. 2064(a). Toro further denies that any of these lawn mowers created an unreasonable risk of death or serious injury. Accordingly, Toro contends that it had no obligation to report to the Commission under section 15(b). 20. Toro contends further that the complaints relating to the Model 8157 mowers were as a result of a local manufacturer-distributor dispute and that no unusual reports of problems were received when the same mowers were redistributed to other parts of the country. 21. Toro further asserts that it has received no reports of injuries from the use of any of the products enumerated in this agreement. Toro makes no admission whatsoever of any fault, liability, or statutory violation in the event any person should claim injuries resulting from the use of these products. 22. Toro further contends that, to the extent there were any leakage problems with any of these lawn mowers, those problems arose prior to Toro's acquisition of Lawn-Boy. Lawn-Boy's prior corporate parent, Outboard Marine Corporation, failed to disclose any such problem to Toro, despite representing in the agreement with Toro to purchase the stock of Lawn-Boy that (1) Lawn-Boy had no liabilities or obligations which would be required to be disclosed on a Financial Statement prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, (2) Lawn-Boy was not in violation of any applicable law, statute, order, rule or regulation, which, if violated, would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect, and (3) since September 30, 1988, no material adverse change or event that was reasonably likely to result in a material adverse change in the assets, liabilities, financial condition, or business of Lawn-Boy had occurred. Toro acted reasonably and with due diligence in relying on these representations to conclude that its newly acquired subsidiary, Lawn-Boy, was in full compliance with the requirements of section 15(b) of the CPSA. VI. Agreement of the Parties 23. The parties enter this agreement solely for the purposes of settlement. Toro and the staff agree that the Commission has jurisdiction in this matter for purposes of entry and enforcement of this Settlement Agreement and Order. 24. Toro agrees to pay the Commission a civil penalty in the amount of one hundred and seventy thousand dollars ($170,000) payable within twenty (20) days after service of the Final Order. This payment is made in settlement of the staff allegations that Toro violated the reporting requirements of section 15(b) of the CPSA with regard to the lawn mowers described above. In agreeing to this settlement, Toro affirms that it does not accept the Commission staff allegations as factual, nor does Toro admit to any liability in this matter. 25. Toro further agrees to assist the Commission staff in any further investigation of this matter by providing, upon specific request and without the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum , such testimony and evidence as Toro would otherwise be required to produce if such a subpoena issued. Toro reserves the right to contest any specific request for information that it believes it would not be required to be produced in response to such a subpoena, and further reserves the right to assert any claims of confidentiality or privilege that would be available in the course of a proceeding by the staff to enforce such a subpoena. 26. The agreement to settle this matter is based on the information provided to the Commission staff by Toro as of May 20, 1994. The Commission reserves the right to seek an additional penalty if it acquires information that establishes that, between November 7, 1989 and November 28, 1990, Toro or its authorized representatives received information from its subsidiary, Lawn-Boy, that reasonably supported the conclusion that gas tank seam separation and leakage in the ``L'' series mowers (a) constituted a defect which could create a substantial product hazard, as that term is defined in section 15(a)(2) of the CPSA, 15 U.S.C. §2064(a)(2), or (b) created an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death. 27. Payment of the full amount of the penalty shall settle fully the staff's allegations set forth in paragraphs 9 through 18 above, subject to the reservation contained in paragraph 26. 28. For the purposes of section 6(b) of the CPSA, 15 U.S.C. §2055(b), this matter shall be treated as if a complaint had issued. 29. Upon provisional acceptance of this Settlement Agreement and Order, the agreement and order shall be placed on the public record and shall be published in the Federal Register in accordance with the procedure set forth in 16 CFR 1118.20(e). If, within 15 days of publication, the Commission has not received any written request not to accept the Settlement Agreement and Order, The Settlement Agreement and Order will be deemed to be finally accepted on the 16th day after the date it is published in the Federal Register (16 CFR 1118.20(f)). 30. Upon final acceptance of this Settlement Agreement and Order by the Commission, Toro knowingly, voluntarily, and completely waives any rights it might have: (1) to an administrative or judicial hearing with respect to the Commission's claim for a civil penalty, (2) to judicial review or other challenge to or contest of the validity of the Commission's action with regard to its claim for a civil penalty, (3) to a determination by the Commission as to whether a violation of section 15(b) of the CPSA, 15 U.S.C. §2064(b), has occurred, and (4) to a statement of findings of fact and conclusions of law with regard to the Commission's claim for a civil penalty. 31. The parties further agree that the Commission shall issue the incorporated Order under the CPSA, 15 U.S.C. §2051 et seq, , and that a violation of the Order will subject Toro to appropriate legal action. 32. No agreement, understanding, representation, or interpretation not contained in this Settlement Agreement may be used to vary or contradict its terms. Dated: June 13, 1994. The Toro Company J.
