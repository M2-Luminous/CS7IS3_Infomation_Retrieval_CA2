He said: For a long time, we have failed to conscientiously handle the relationship between reform, development, and stability as reiterated in the government work report. We have always attached more importance to the total amount of fixed assets and shown more interest in developing new projects and increasing investment. However, we have not given sufficient attention to the available fixed assets and the equipment replacement and renovation of old enterprises. As a result, the economy has grown rapidly on the one hand, but, on the other, old enterprises have experienced difficulties in every step they take. Likewise, Heilongjiang has reaped bumper grain harvests every year, but peasants' income and local revenue have not increased rapidly as grain output has. Governor Shao Qihui analyzed the reasons for such contrast. He said: It has resulted both from the problems in our work and the oversights and omissions in policies. The basic problem lies in our failure in handling well the relationship between reform, development, and stability. He continued: To better implement major state policies in our specific economic activities, we, as the local government, should measure our specific work against the government work report and find out where we lag behind. We should note both the increase in the growth rate of economic development and the increase in the number of loss-making large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises; and both the substantial improvement in living standard with some people becoming well-off ahead of others and the great difficulties in the life of some localities and some staff members and workers. To successfully address these problems, we should refrain from empty sloganeering. Speaking on Heilongjiang's agricultural economy, Governor Shao Qihui said: We should not regard the peasant economy as the agricultural economy. While attaching importance to the interests of peasants, we should also step up efforts to build up local and township and village finance; and while speeding up the increase in grain output, we should also accelerate the development of the nonagricultural economy so that Heilongjiang Province will become a large province in agricultural economy at an early date instead of a large province in agriculture.
