Qian told a Japanese delegation led by House of Councillors President Bunbei Hara that China does not know for sure for what purpose North Korea is trying to develop nuclear facilities, the officials said. Qian said he cannot determine whether North Korea wants to use the facilities peacefully or develop nuclear weapons, or to use the nuclear issue as a means of improving relations with the United States, according to the Japanese officials. North Korea has been accused of trying to develop a nuclear arsenal and of refusing to accept full inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Qian also said that as the North Korean nuclear issue has had effects on Japan and South Korea particularly, China will try to find a solution through dialogue, the officials said. The foreign minister, noting Pyongyang's dissatisfaction with China's establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea, said Beijing set up ties with Seoul so as not to isolate North Korea, the officials said. Meanwhile in Vienna, an IAEA spokesman on Friday denied reports from South Korea that the international nuclear watchdog has shown willingness to compromise with the North on the contents of inspections in a letter to Pyongyang. The IAEA has not changed its stance of not sending any inspectors unless Pyongyang agrees to full inspections, the spokesman said. According to the reports from South Korea, the IAEA informed North Korea it would send inspectors on condition that an important radiation measurement be conducted at a key nuclear facility at a later date.
