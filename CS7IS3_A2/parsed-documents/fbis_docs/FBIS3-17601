The foreign mass media quote reports of an anonymous intelligence source, which maintains that the programme is being implemented under the control of the Russian Defence Ministry. In the opinion of experts from the Defence Ministry, it is rather astonishing that the forgery, circulated in the West in search of a sensation, was thoughtlessly repeated by some Russian mass media organs, which had ample opportunity to contact specialists and check the correctness of the reports.
