FR940805-0-00067 FR940805-0-00022 In the NPRM, the regulations for emergency lightering equipment were located in a proposed new subpart G at 33 CFR 157.420. Because the requirements for structural measures, which were located in proposed §§157.410 and 157.415 in the NPRM, are not being issued at this time, the requirements for emergency lightering operations will be located at §157.410 in the final rule. Section 157.400 entitled ``Purpose and scope'' is being issued at this time except that proposed paragraph (c), which established the effective date for the entire subpart, has been deleted. Regulatory Evaluation The NPRM of October 22, 1993, was classified as ``major'' under Executive Order 12291, which was in effect, because the cost of the proposed requirements would be over $100 million annually. As previously discussed, the final rule implements only a minor portion of that proposal. This rule is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866, and has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). A draft Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT has been prepared and is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under `` ADDRESSES .'' The Evaluation is summarized as follows. Summary of Benefits This rulemaking requires all applicable vessels to carry emergency lightering equipment including reducers, adapters, bolts, washers, nuts, and gaskets. The principal benefit will be to facilitate rapid oil transfer from a stricken tank vessel to another tank vessel in those instances where the stricken vessel's cargo pumps are operable. The resultant ability to rapidly transfer oil will minimize the risk of further spillage. A review of a sample of marine pollution cases did not reveal a sufficient number of incidents from which the benefits of this measure could be directly quantified. However, the measures will be useful in cases where a vessel's cargo transfer system remains operational although portions of the ship are damaged and substantial quantities of oil remain aboard. This lightering equipment can be used to reduce the risk of further spillage. This final rule also requires a foreign flag vessel to report its IMO international number to the Coast Guard Captain of the Port when reporting its advance notice of arrival. This international number will provide the Coast Guard with a means of accessing Marine Safety Information System (MSIS) data on the vessel, from which the Coast Guard may determine whether any special attention would be necessary if the vessel were involved in a collision or grounding. A quick response that takes into account the special circumstances of a vessel will significantly reduce the amount of oil spilled as a result of a collision or grounding. Although the benefits from this requirement could be significant, the Coast Guard is unable to quantify them from available data. Summary of Costs The present value of the cost to the tank vessel industry of providing a storage area and acquiring emergency lightering equipment is expected to total $6 million. U.S. tank vessels will incur $1 million of the total cost and foreign tank vessels trading with the United States will incur the remaining $5 million. The undiscounted cost per vessel will range from $4,000 to $9,500 for foreign tank vessels, and $5,000 to $12,500 for U.S. tank vessels covered by this final rule, depending on the configuration of the vessel and extent of modifications required to provide appropriate storage. The undiscounted cost for U.S. tank barges is estimated at about $5,000 per barge. Additionally, the cost to U.S. tank vessels may be more expensive because U.S. materials and labor rates are generally higher. The requirement for a foreign vessel to provide its international number in its advance notice of arrival report will create no additional cost to the tank barge and tankship industries. Tank vessels are now required to report advance notice of arrival to the Captain of the Port of each U.S. port visited, and the international number is readily available to the master, owner, or agent. The present value of the total cost of this final rule to the tankship and tank barge industries is $6 million. Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), the Coast Guard must consider the economic impact on small entities for this rule. The present value of the cost of this rule totals $6 million. The undiscounted cost per vessel will range from as low as $4,000&hyph;$5,000 per vessel for the smallest tankship and tank barge included in this rulemaking to only $12,500 per vessel for the largest U.S. flag tank vessel affected. These sums include both the hardware and shipyard costs for stowage arrangements and are extremely small when compared with the capital invested in the affected vessels. No early vessel retirements are anticipated as a result of this final rule. In accordance with OPA 90, the Coast Guard excludes from this final rule the tank barge and tankship fleet under 5,000 GT.
