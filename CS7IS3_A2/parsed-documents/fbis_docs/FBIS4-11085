Raul presented an enlarged picture of Eastern Army Chief Ramon Espinosa Martin, in which both men are standing in front of a billboard reading: This command is top notch. Raul affirmed that this gift marks the 33rd anniversary of the creation of the Eastern Army, and described as masterful the demonstrations he attended. The closing address by Division General Ulises Rosales del Toro, member of the Politburo and chief of the FAR General Staff, stressed that the council's accomplishments are part of a program which foresaw the current situation much earlier than other institutions. He pointed out that the key has been the implementation of a complete concept were every FAR Ministry member has specific responsibilities, from the minister to the soldier. In its final phase, the council listened to addresses by the first secretaries of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] in Guantanamo, Santiago de Cuba, and Holguin Provinces, regarding the energy potential of these regions. The PCC officials stressed efforts and results of the work to increase, among other things, the use of bagasse and shaft, the construction of minidams and windmills, and conservation of traditional fuels. Central Committee member Eugenio Mainegra gave a special address to the council on the status of the nationwide efforts to solve difficulties in alternative energy sources efforts. Earlier, the FAR minister's work group and the members of the military council visited the Limoncito hydraulic complex designed to irrigate plantain plantations by gravity. The project, with a capacity of 7.14 million cubic meters, supplies water to 33 plantain caballerias planted on planters in order to enrich the organic layers of the soil and improve drainage. Limoncito is a landmark for Holguin construction workers who in 10 months in 1992 completed the main reservoir, a flow regulating facility, and over four kilometers of the channel. The military visitors also inaugurated an experimental facility for processing agricultural residues such as sugarcane shaft which is shaped into compact briquettes. Once the facility reaches its top production capacity it will produce over 4,000 metric tons of briquettes a year, which will replace 1,440 tons of oil or prevent having to cut down 174 hectares of forest. At his site, coal and phenolic acids are obtained simultaneously. These are used to produce heavy oils such as creosol, guaiacum, emollients, and solvents. During a visit to a repair workshop, the two work groups observed procedures to make tires for light vehicles with methods developed in that workshop -- a vanguard unit of the FAR Civilian Workers Union. According to technical tests the final product's quality is superior to imports and lays a basis for the budding production of tires for heavy vehicles. Great prowess has been demonstrated by the mini-industries of the General Staff of the Eastern Army, which have produced so far this year, 21 tons of food including candied preserves, tomato and other vegetables pastes, candy, and cassava. In the other 51 facilities of this type in the Eastern Army the production extends to detergents, lotions made from citrus extracts, liquid and bar soap, and shoe polish and dye. Before the closing of the council, there was a praiseworthy cooking demonstration including 160 recipes for cooking fresh water fish grown in dozens of army units. The things seen in the extensive tour evidence how much is being done by the Eastern Army to overcome the effects of the special period and contribute to the FAR and to Cuba's development. Raul was right when he affirmed in his farewell that it will be difficult to take away from the Eastern Army the title of best in the FAR.
