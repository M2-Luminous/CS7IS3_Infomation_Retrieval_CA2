FR941110-0-00325 FR941110-0-00019 (e) Appraisal. Determinations of fair market value under this section shall be made on the basis of appraisal within a reasonable time prior to sale, by an independent appraiser to be selected by the IHA. ยง905.1015 Use of sale proceeds. (a) General authority for use. Sale proceeds may, after provision for sale and administrative costs that are necessary and reasonable for carrying out the homeownership plan, be retained by the IHA and used for housing assistance to low-income families (as such families are defined under the Act). The term ``sale proceeds'' includes all payments made by purchasers for credit to the purchase price ( e.g., earnest money, downpayments, payments out of the proceeds of mortgage loans, and principal and interest payments under purchase-money mortgages), along with any amounts payable upon resale under ยง905.1014, and interest earned on all such receipts. (Residual receipts, as defined in the ACC, shall not be treated as sale proceeds.) (b) Permissible uses. Sale proceeds may be used for any one or more of the following forms of housing assistance for low-income families, at the discretion of the IHA and as stated in the HUD-approved homeownership plan: (1) In connection with the homeownership plan from which the funds are derived, for purposes that are justified to ensure the success of the plan and to protect the interests of the homeowners, the IHA and any other entity with responsibility for carrying out the plan. Nonexclusive examples include nonroutine maintenance reserves under Sec. 905.1011, a reserve for loans to homeowners to prevent or cure default or for other emergency housing needs; a reserve for any contingent liabilities of the IHA under the homeownership plan (such as IHA guaranty of mortgage loans); and a reserve for IHA repurchase, repair and resale of homes in the event of defaults. (2) In connection with another HUD-approved homeownership plan under this part, for assistance to purchasers and for reasonable planning and implementation costs. (3) In connection with a Tribal, State or local homeownership program for low-income families, as described in the homeownership plan, for assistance to purchasers and for reasonable planning and implementation costs. Under such programs, sales proceeds may be used to construct or acquire additional dwellings for sale to low-income families, or to assist such families in purchasing other dwellings from public or private owners. (4) In connection with the IHA's other low-income housing that remains under ACC, for any purposes authorized for the use of operating funds under the ACC and applicable provisions of the Act and Federal regulations, as included in the HUD-approved operating budgets. Examples include maintenance and modernization, augmentation of operating reserves, protective services, and resident services. Such use shall not result in the reduction of the operating subsidy otherwise payable to the IHA for its other low-income housing. (5) In connection with any other type of Federal, Tribal, State, or local housing program for low-income families, as described in the homeownership plan. ยง905.1016 Replacement housing. (a) Replacement requirement . As a condition for transfer of ownership under a HUD-approved homeownership plan, the IHA must obtain a funding commitment, from HUD or another source, for the replacement of each of the dwellings to be sold under the plan. Replacement housing may be provided by one or any combination of the following methods: (1) Development by the IHA of additional low-income housing under this part (by new construction or acquisition). (2) Rehabilitation of vacant low-income housing owned by the IHA. (3) Use of five-year, tenant-based certificate or voucher assistance under Section 8 of the Act. (4) If the homeownership plan is submitted by the IHA for sale to residents through an RMC, resident organization or cooperative association which is otherwise eligible to participate under this subpart, acquisition of nonpublicly-owned housing units, which the RMC, resident organization or cooperative association will operate as rental housing, comparable to IHA-owned low-income housing as to term of assistance, housing standards, eligibility, and contribution to rent.
