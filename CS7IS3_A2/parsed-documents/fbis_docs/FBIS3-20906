The report of about fifty pages is the result of five work sessions held in September and October. It will now be analyzed and evaluated by the academies (the Academy of Science and Academy of Ethical and Political Sciences) at College de France; by the Parliamentary Office for Scientific and Technological Options; by the conference of university presidents, deans of major educational institutions, and directors of engineering schools; by the heads of organizations such as CNRS, INRA, or INRIA; by the Economic and Social Council; by unions; and by cabinet ministers. A new meeting of the study committee, in January, should incorporate findings stated in a new report due on 20 January at the latest, so as to form the focus for an in-depth institutional consultation and for national and regional forums, and later for a national summary debate as well (these being scheduled between 15 February and 31 March). The result should be a final orientation report intended to be the solid core of a document which will be sent to Parliament for debate during the spring 1994 session. Francois Fillon, minister of Higher Education and Research, has been the moving force behind this vast national consultation on scientific and technological research policy for the coming years, which is meant to continue the national forum on research held twelve years ago at the initiative of Jean-Pierre Chevenement who was minister at the time. For Robert Dautray, president of the study group and high commissioner for atomic energy, who commented on the preliminary report, one of the most difficult problems which absolutely must be included in assessments of higher education and research problems, is the increase in the number of students, the changing role of the teaching profession, and the resulting need for new opportunities. The influx of students in general education further increases the importance of the problem. It would be appropriate to create training programs that are brief, technical, and less selective than the current IUT and BTS. There should be many more full-time instructors, and more university awareness of the industrial world and its problems. According to Jacques Friedel, president of the Academy of Sciences, it would be appropriate for researchers to crown their careers in an academic setting. Another problem is the question of major research equipment, indispensable but increasingly expensive tools which often require joint purchase and management with many countries. Basic research must in no way be neglected or channelled because it nurtures future applied research, according to Catherine Cesarsky, an astronomer at CEA (Saclay). French basic research is good, recognized in countries abroad and in turn more open to them because it has improved during the past ten years. It provides five percent of the material in major scientific publications. France's competition must be met, its engineering research increased, its risk-taking encouraged, and its chronic conservatism overcome. For the study group, and particularly for Pierre Douzou, member of the Academy, life sciences, medical research and agronomic research with their applications are increasingly converging at a fundamental level through genetic studies, but too often, except for the pharmacological sector, industrial applications are late in coming or fall short of expectations. Concerning the major programs which are also at the core of these investigations, second only to space problems, the preliminary report finds as does Jacques-Louis Lions, former CNES president, that it behooves the government, if it chooses these programs, to also set their goals concretely, clearly, with specific objectives and timeframes. They should be evaluated openly and he did not deny that the computer, supergenerator, and space programs should have been reassessed in a timely fashion. Thanks to their increasing capabilities and speed, computers have become a universal tool which spill over into all fields such as aeronautics research as a whole. The constant influence of present circumstances and of economic problems on industrial research, which together with innovation in PME-PMI (small and medium enterprises) is still much too inadequate, often has negative effects. At the same time transfer of knowledge and technology continues to take place too slowly and badly, notably with respect to small enterprises, partly because of inadequate basic research which is not "finalized" and because work likely to be of interest to research and already performed in laboratories is not well known. According to Pierre Aigrain, former minister, the preliminary report has drawn up a list of questions and has defined some of them very well. According to him, for science and technology to play their proper role today, research has to be less compartmentalized, has to recover its flexibility while keeping its discipline, its quality, its very excellence; its work must be held relevant to industrial requirements. In a way, according to sociologist Alain Touraine, science has to become more community-oriented and scientists must examine the ways in which the consequences of knowledge affect society.
