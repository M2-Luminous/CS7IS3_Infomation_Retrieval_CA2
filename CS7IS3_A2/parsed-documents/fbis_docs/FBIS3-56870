"We intend to pay the most urgent debts--to settle accounts with the military, industrial, and agro-industrial complexes--and to pay salaries to budget organizations, as well as to pay for delivery of all necessary goods to the North", he said. Chernomyrdin said that the government expects that inflation will be around 15-18 percent per month during the first six months of this year; it will be approximately 12-14 percent per month during the second six months, and it will be reduced to 8-9 percent per month by the end of this year. At the same time, the head of the government stressed that inflation "was and will be the main problem". He said that "everything else depends on how we will solve this problem". "The rate of inflation is going at a speed opposite to that of the reforms". The prime minister said that efforts to stabilize finances have been undermined by two reasons: on the one hand, by the structure of the economy and the structural problems that provoke the stagnation of investment and a production slump, and on the other hand by actions of the federal bodies of power that sometimes make promises that nobody can fulfill. As for the welfare area, Chernomyrdin said it currently needed in-depth reforms. He noted, however, that it was necessary to do it without increasing inflation and through a rational redistribution of state resources--by closing inefficient producers, stimulating private investments, and creating new, additional jobs. Chernomyrdin thinks that the fall in the ruble's exchange rate represents an objective and an inevitable process. "For several months running, we kept the ruble's exchange rate stable," he noted. "In the meantime, the closer correlation between world and domestic prices makes it necessary to tie the exchange rate more strictly to the level of inflation". The head of government said that the new Cabinet would most likely modify its reform policy. He said that the modification would consist in the fact that within the framework of combatting inflation "we would move from one type of measures, predominantly monetarist, to non-monetarist measures tried and tested in numerous European countries". Chernomyrdin specified that this meant, above all, the creation of real competition in the Russian economy. "It is, in fact, a measure of the market's great openness toward the world economy--the removal of artificial restrictions on the access of foreign goods and capital to Russia", he emphasized. Chernomyrdin confirmed that "the presidential course toward in- depth and democratic reforms of the Russian society did continue, does continue, and will continue". The president and the Constitution are the main guarantors of this, he said.
