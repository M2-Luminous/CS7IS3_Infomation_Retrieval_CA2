S5.2.1␣Steel containers and liners. (a) Steel containers and liners shall be of uniform quality. Only the basic oxygen or electric furnace processes are authorized. The steel shall be aluminum killed and produced to predominantly fine grain practice. The steel heat analysis shall be in conformance with one of the following grades: Table One_Steel Heat Analysis 1Grade element 1Chrome-Molybdenum percent 1Carbon-Boron percent 1Carbon-Manganese percent Carbon 0.25 to 0.38 0.27 to 0.37 0.40 max. Manganese 0.40 to 1.05 0.80 to 1.40 1.65 max. Phosphorus 0.015 max 0.015 max 0.025 max. Sulfur 0.010 max 0.010 max 0.010 max. Silicon 0.15 to 0.35 0.30 max 0.10/0.30 Chromium 0.80 to 1.15 N/A N/A Molybdenum 0.15 to 0.25 N/A N/A Boron N/A 0.0005 to 0.003 N/A Aluminum 0.02 to 0.07 0.02 to 0.07 0.02/0.07 1``N/A'' means not applicable. (b) Incidental elements shall be within the limits specified in the Standard Specification for Steel, Sheet and Strip, Alloy, Hot-Rolled and Cold-Rolled, General Requirements for ASTM A 505 (1987). S5.2.1.1␣When carbon-boron steel is used, the test specimen is subject to a hardenability test in accordance with the Standard Method for End-Quench Test For Hardenability of Steel, ASTM A 255 (1989). The hardness evaluation is made 7.9 mm (5/16 inch) from the quenched end of the Jominy quench bar. S5.2.1.2␣The test specimen's hardness shall be at least Rc (Rockwell Hardness) 33 and no more than Rc 53.
