The most important result of this work is mathematically confident establishment of a direct connection between morbidity and the radiation factor on territory with low doses of external irradiation. In a broader view, it is a matter of undoubted radiation causality of many illnesses of the populace in regions of ``Russian Chernobyl.'' At the same time, the discovered causality is complicated, and cannot be given any unambiguous interpretation in only one direction, positive or negative. Some illnesses are typified by decreased incidence with time, and improvement of the state of health with respect to given illnesses (pneumonia, rheumatism), while others show an increase (myocardial ischemia, cerebral illnesses, diabetes and so on) for the same radiation conditions. It is important to recognize that the general direction of change of morbidity, or the overall direction of the change in state of health of residents of ``Russian Chernobyl'' unfortunately is negative. This is confirmed by the fact of an increase in morbidity, although some stabilization, or rather a trend toward stabilization, is noted in 1991. There is a lot of work remaining in ascertainment of the mechanisms of radiation causality of illnesses, reconstruction of the initially received dose of radiation, further analysis of discovered facts of ``splitting'' of illnesses into two (``+'' and ``-'') groups and much more. Perhaps the developed methodology and practice of the comprehensive approach will enable more rapid and rational advancement in solution of the formulated problems. The problem of the interrelationship between morbidity and low doses of chronic radiation exposure is not only of considerable theoretical significance, but is also of considerable practical importance for the fates of people taking part in cleanup of the accident at Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power Plant. A large detachment of Russian volunteer miners from Tulskaya Oblast worked on driving a tunnel beneath the exploded reactor of the fourth power generating unit at Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power Plant. After receiving considerable unaccounted- for doses of irradiation, the miners returned to their permanent residences in various regions of Tulskaya Oblast (as well as Orlovskaya, Kurskaya, Lipetskaya and other oblasts), where the contamination density usually does not exceed 5-10 Ci/km[.sup]2[/]. According to traditional concepts rooted in radiobiology, these densities of fallout of radionuclides cesium-137 (and, correspondingly, strontium-90) are insignificant, and they cannot form appreciable doses of external and internal irradiation. This was indeed the position of experts of the International Chernobyl Committee. However, this leaves out many factors. First of all, the cleanup men who received large doses are still living in this same Tulskaya Oblast for the seventh year along with the native population (who likewise received certain doses) under conditions of low but CHRONIC constant irradiation acting on an organism that had already experienced dose burdens in 1986. Some food products, especially in homes, are still contaminated. Residents are not receiving any supplemental food products rich in protein and vitamins. There is no qualified medical assistance or systematic observation and monitoring of the health of the population (including cleanup workers) in regions of both Tulskaya Oblast and other middle Russian oblasts. Under these conditions, the possibility of existence of danger must unconditionally be given top priority, and the impact of low doses of chronic exposure must be taken into account as a risk factor, and not deliberately discarded as insignificant, especially as regards cleanup personnel still living in contaminated regions. We have already spoken of the inadequacies of Russian legislation in the field of social compensation, which to a considerable extent is due to the serious economic situation of the country. But no less important are the stereotypes that have evolved concerning the harmlessness of low doses of irradiation. Thanks to these notions, the ``Russian Chernobyl'' of 15 regions did not exist, as it were, for 5 years, and it is only within the last 1.5-2 years that work has begun on scientific investigation of various aspects of the Russian Chernobyl problem area. We would hope that this expert conclusion, as all publications of ``Consequences of the Chernobyl Disaster'' that apply to the indivisible Chernobyl region of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, will draw attention of the public and of government agencies of CIS nations to the need for increased activity in work on Chernobyl, once more uniting the efforts of scientists and specialists in solving a crucial problem of our time. General Findings The data given above show that in the near future there must be a drastic increase in activity on studying contaminated territories of the Russian Chernobyl. There is work to be done on development, comprehensive discussion and acceptance of a government program for organizing a permanently operating monitoring service in each region of Russia that has been subjected to radiation contamination. I. The expert proposals set forth below on further investigation of radiation conditions in Russia are aimed at significantly increasing the extent of radioecological coverage of the territory, and developing practical measures for alleviating the radiation situation. 1. A proposal for aerophotographic-spectral surveys of radioactive contamination of the locality in the European part of Russia as a result of the Chernobyl accident includes: -surveys of previously unstudied territories on a scale of 1:1,000,000: Volgogradskaya Oblast; Kalmykia; Saratovskaya Oblast (right-bank regions of the Volga); Nenets Province; -a detailed examination of regions with elevated levels of reserve of cesium-137 revealed as a result of work in 1991 on a total area of 72,400 km[.sup]2[/] (Penzenskaya, Ulyanovskaya, Saratovskaya and Novgordskaya Oblasts, and Mordovia). 2. Tracing Chernobyl contamination on the territory of Siberia by aerophotographic spectral surveys on a scale of 1:5,000,000. 3. Setting up a computer database on radioactive contamination and fallout of chemical products. 4. Publishing maps of radioactive and chemical contamination in the first and second quarters of 1993. 5. Producing maps of chemical contamination for territories where zones of radioactive contamination due to the Chernobyl accident have been observed. This will enable an integrated approach to assessments of the synergic (combined) effect of anthropogenic contaminants on man. II. Analysis of social aspects of migration of the population in radioactively contaminated regions of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine suggests several general conclusions and some specific forecasts relative to regions of the ``Russian Chernobyl.'' 1. A study of the demographic situation in its various aspects should be considered a component of the assessment of long-term consequences of the Chernobyl accident, while demographic forecasts should be one of the possible guidelines of the outlook for development of the region. 2. In the near future, the demographic, economic, psychological and political situation in the disaster zone, especially including regions of Russia, will be determined to a great extent by migration of the population. Efflux of the population from rural localities and municipal settlements constitutes the principal features of this migration. 3. Consequences of the efflux are important not just from the standpoint of future development of the regions themselves, but also for the fate of several tens of thousands, and possible even hundreds of thousands of people migrating ``at their own peril and risk.'' This is essentially an open form of forced migration, and the population taking part in this process should rightfully be considered ecological refugees with corresponding rights to housing in regions of lodging. A significant part must be played by regions of Russia to which a flow of refugees is coming from Belarus and Ukarine. 4. The scales of consequences of the migration go beyond the confines of the region directly affected by the accident. The large specific weight of movements between republics, especially to Russia, confirms conclusions about the global nature, the proliferation of consequences of the disaster, rather than localization, as oficially expressed. In this connection, the problem arises of forming reserve funds for building refugee housing and developing a public health system. Appropriate intergovernmental agreements are needed on arranging employment for refugees. 5. Despite regional differences, it is by natural migration that the populace is resolving the severe contradictions existing since 1986. Trends of migration evidence poor effectiveness of stabilization by compensatory measures directed at alleviating the consequences of the disaster, especially in the region of the ``Russian Chernobyl.'' Therefore, the forecast of migration subsumes at least two scenarios. According to the first, the traditionally inertial scenario, events will occur in accordance with the system set forth above. The second scenario presumes an effective policy of compensations capable of stabilizing the situation, and especially for the forthcoming process of migration to the Russian Federation. The uniqueness of the situation that has arisen as a result of the break of economic ties and administrative structures of the former USSR, there is no great optimism relative to the second scenario. Nevertheless, implementation of new social guidelines of the development of society should include as a priority a truly effective and coordinated social policy in regions affected by the Chernobyl disaster. III. The consensus on results of expert work in assessing the state of health of the populace in the ``Russian Chernobyl'' subregion is set forth in the Conclusion of the corresponding section. Therefore, we will limit ourselves here to a few of the most pertinent conclusions drawn from development of a general procedural approach and comprehensive multivariate statistical analysis of medical demographic indicators and radioecological factors of the habitat of the populace in radioactively contaminated regions. 1. Contingent of people subjected to the action of radiation and residing on various territories differ significantly in the structure of morbidity. Ecological factors of the regions on the whole have a noticeable effect on the state of health of the populace residing there. 2. In regions with an elevated level of radiation contamination, there is a considerable change in the structure of morbidity due to an increase in the percentage of rare illnesses: in regions of the Chernobyl zone as a whole, there is a dramatic increase in the incidence (double or triple) of diseases that are virtually not seen in Moscow. 3. Based on the example of Tulskaya Oblast, trustworthy dose dependences have been discovered between morbidity and degree of radiation contamination of regions, which serves as direct proof of radiation causality of some illnesses. 4. Analysis of the dynamics of morbidity has revealed a genuine change of morbidity with respect to a number of separate nosological units both toward an increase, and toward a decrease. 5. The dynamics of the integral measure of deviation of morbidity with respect to the totality of nosological units from the initial (1985) state is markedly nonlinear. An assessment of the direction of these changes shows that they are negative on the whole: in the period following 1986, there is an increase in morbidity, especially dramatic in 1986-1988, with some reduction of the increase in morbidity and stabilization in 1990. 6. ``Splitting'' of the totality of illnesses into a group with positive dynamics and a group with negative dynamics is consistent with the concept of integrated action of factors of the habitat on the organism as a hierarchical structure of mutually regulated subsystems, and may serve as an argument supporting this concept. 7. The time dependence of the integral index of directionality of correlations between different illnesses shows extremum behavior. The position of the maximum in 1986-1987 gives evidence of the important contribution of the radiation component to the observed changes of morbidity. 8. Our approach allows an integral assessment of the state of health of the population of regions, tracking of dynamics, and establishment of a relation between the state of health and the degree of radiation contamination, which opens the way to demarcation of territories of elevated risk and development of purposeful and effective protective measures.
