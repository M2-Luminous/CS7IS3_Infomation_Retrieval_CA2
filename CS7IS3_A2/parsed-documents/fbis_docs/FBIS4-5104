At the same time, the people are irate over the recent reckless remarks and acts of the North Korean delegation. The people's view of the nuclear issue is motivated by their ardent patriotic sentiment. How then, has this situation developed? How can we break through this situation? The world's nations are making efforts to join a new post-Cold War global order comprised of liberal democracy and the market economy. However, a mere handful of nations are spurning this trend. Unfortunately, and to our dismay, North Korea is one such nation, and may in fact be a most extreme case. What kind of choice did Pyongyang, isolated from the international order, have? While the norm would be to pursue the citizens' welfare and peace, Pyongyang chose the opposite road. In other words, it invoked the nuclear problem. Will Pyongyang's rash gamble be successful? North Korea's adherance to nuclear development will ultimately lead to Pyongyang's defeat. The North Korean economy will sour even more and North Korea will become a helpless international orphan. Pyongyang alone denounced the statement of the UN Security Council President that the world supported. What is our strategy in dealing with North Korea? When the North Korean nuclear problem was raised, there were some who called for procuring nuclear arms. However, we know that this road leads to mutual destruction. The road to coexistence is to remove the suspicion of North Korean nuclear development. Our choice is to persuade North Korea to realize a solution to its nuclear problem and to join an international flow which is healthy to itself. Only this strategy will not sabotage the peace and security of the Korean peninsula in the course of pursuing a resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue. This strategy will improve North-South relations and lay a foundation for national reunification. In view of this strategy, our immediate goals toward the North Korean nuclear issue become clear. First, we should prevent North Korea from further extraction of nuclear materials. Second, we should make efforts to place nuclear materials already produced in North Korea under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. Third, we should attempt to make North Korean nuclear facilities peaceful and safe like our energy facilities. During the past year, these strategies and goals of ours were supported by the consensus of the people. I must frankly admit, however, that recently, public agreement on the method for achieving such aims has not been clear. The people's consensus on the solution method is more important now, with the North Korean nuclear problem pending at the UN Security Council, than ever before. The approach we pursued during the past year for a solution to the North Korean nuclear issue, was to first resolve the problem through joint efforts by the North and the South, and to rely on international strength secondly, only when our efforts proved futile. Incentive and pressure (more commonly referred to as carrots and sticks) were the means used to resolve the nuclear problem. Up to the present, dialogue has been the preferred channel for solving the problem because, at the least, we would gain time for us to prepare the sticks. Now that the North Korean nuclear issue has been referred to the UN Security Council, a change began to take place in the of dialogue and sticks, and the importance of sticks is growing. This means that the international aspect in resolving this issue is becoming more important. The role of the ROK and of allies including the United States and Japan was particularly important in the course of dialogue. However, the Chinese role is now growing and the attitude of Russia and nonaligned countries in the UN Security Council is also becoming important. The number of nations looking to play a part in the nuclear issue, not to mention the nations directly concerned, is increasing. This means that we cannot effectively solve the nuclear problem by merely taking North-South relations into account. We must now be prepared for such changes in the situation. The most important factor in our attitude for preparations is precise awareness of the essence of the problem. In other words, while keeping our strategy and goals firm, our methods and means should neither adhere to a single-track nor be hardline. With the referral of the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council, and the apparent need for a long-range solution, we must discriminate between the essential and the marginal, and the more important from the less important. We should keep a long-term perspective on the situation, rather than going from elation to sorrow from one moment to the next over temporary developments in the situation. We should remain patient in applying means and methods and display wisdom in consolidating our internal unity. While it is true that those who harbor deep feelings and concerns for a satisfactory solution to the North Korean nuclear problem are more likely to harbor brighter and more ardent expectations toward this, it is not reasonable to expect an immediate solution. In particular, we may be inclined to view North-South relations, which remains at its starting point, as being in a state of competition and confrontation. However, this viewpoint is not helpful for a solution to the nuclear problem. Moreover, if our feelings and self-esteem are affected by North Korea's attempts to regard a symbolic, worthless victory in confrontation with us as a great victory, we may easily be dragged into its psychological game, and the situation will become more complicated. We are indeed in a difficult situation. However, we should recall our strategy and goals and consolidate them. It is also important for us to wait for the right opportunity by assuming flexible attitudes, means, and methods. This will only be possible when we balance principles and means, have a broad view on international affairs, and a long-term view on developments in the situation. We should cherish, above all, a sense of self-confidence and faith that time is on our side.
