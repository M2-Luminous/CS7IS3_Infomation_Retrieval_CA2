FR941116-1-00010 FR941116-1-00004 Federal Highway Administration 23 CFR Part 627 [FHWA Docket No. 94&hyph;12] RIN 2125&hyph;AD33 Value Engineering AGENCY: Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The FHWA proposes to issue a regulation on value engineering (VE) that would require its application to selected Federal-aid highway projects, when funded under the FHWA's grant-in-aid process. The proposed regulation would require State highway agencies (SHA) to establish and administer VE programs; it outlines minimum VE program requirements and provides guidance in establishing, administering, and monitoring a VE program. This proposed regulation is considered necessary to implement 23 U.S.C. 106(d), which provides that, in such cases as the Secretary deems advisable, the Secretary may require a value engineering or other cost reduction analysis of plans, specifications, and estimates for proposed projects on any Federal-aid highway. DATES: Comments must be received on or before January 17, 1995. ADDRESSES: Submit written and signed comments to the Federal Highway Administration, HCC&hyph;10, FHWA Docket No. 94&hyph;12, Room 4232, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, D.C. 20590. All comments and suggestions received will be available for examination at the above address between 8:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m., e.t., Monday through Friday, except for Federal holidays. Those desiring notification of receipt of comments must include a self-addressed, stamped postcard. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Keith Borkenhagen, Office of Engineering, 202&hyph;366&hyph;4630, or Wilbert Baccus, Office of Chief Counsel, 202&hyph;366&hyph;0780, Federal Highway Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, D.C. 20590. Office hours are from 7:45 a.m. to 4:15 p.m., e.t., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FHWA recognizes VE as an effective and proven technique for reducing cost, increasing productivity, and improving quality when applied in the development of highway projects. This document solicits public comments regarding the VE requirements being considered by the FHWA. In 1991, the Congress required the FHWA to study its VE program. Section 1091 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, Public Law 102&hyph;240, 105 Stat. 1914 (Dec 18, 1991), required the Secretary of Transportation to ``study the effectiveness and benefits of value engineering review programs applied to Federal-aid highway projects,'' and to ``report to Congress on the results of the study *␣*␣* including recommendations on how value engineering could be utilized and improved in Federal-aid highway projects.'' The FHWA's evaluation of the effectiveness of its VE program, as described in a report submitted to Congress in June 1993, 1 concluded that the application of VE in the development of highway projects has the potential to result in substantial cost savings without adversely affecting any of the highway projects' design, aesthetics, or construction standards while assuring that environmental and ecological goals are maintained. During the study made to prepare this report, the FHWA examined VE data covering fiscal year (FY) 1988 to FY 1991 and found that only a limited number of States had active and effective VE programs. 1 ``Value Engineering on Federal-aid Projects,'' a report to Congress by the Secretary of Transportation is available for inspection and copying as prescribed in 49 CFR part 7 appendix D. A copy is in the file for FHWA Docket No. 94&hyph;12. The study found that FHWA's policy of the past 20 years of promoting VE through education, encouragement, and technical assistance has had limited success in persuading all States to implement VE programs on a continuing basis. This finding is despite overwhelming evidence that VE can be a very effective way to improve projects and control costs from States with active VE programs. The FHWA has, therefore, concluded that in order to improve the effectiveness of the VE program nationwide, all States need to have active VE programs. As a result, the FHWA proposes to require the use of VE in all States on selected Federal-aid highway projects.
