The sector did not forsake its main feature, reliability, in the past year, which was very difficult for power industry personnel. Professor Anatoliy Dyakov, the head of the new power company "YeES [Unified Energy System of Russia], called last year a peculiar test of maturity for the company. Having converted the enterprises of the sector to joint-stock operations, the new company restructured the system of management in the electric power sector of Russia while preserving in the process its main advantage--the unity of the power system. It is precisely owing to this that, in the environment of an economic crisis, the generation of electricity fell by as little as 5.5 percent last year. However, difficulties entailed by changes in the system of management have become secondary compared to daily concerns. Nonpayments by consumers of electricity have exceeded the 4 trillion-ruble mark and have in essence left the industry without the funds to develop, despite it being necessary for the electric power industry to commission 8-9 million kilowatts of capacity annually in order to replace worn-out generators. It is fitting to recall that in one-half of the power stations of Russia the service life of the equipment has ended completely. Financial difficulties were exacerbated by problems in supplying the thermal stations with fuel, in particular coal. Thus, at a number of stations in the Urals region fuel reserves came to just over 60 percent of the 1992 level, and at power stations of the Far East--just 30 percent. The plan for 1994 is to reduce coal production by 50-60 million tonnes, which will primarily deal a painful blow specifically to the electric power sector. After all, most of Russia's 600 thermal stations use coal as their primary fuel. The absence or clearly inadequate reserves of fuel pose the threat of stoppages at quite a number of nuclear power stations. In addition to the startup of new power units at the Pskov, Nizhnevartovsk, St. Petersburg, and a number of power plants in the Far East, the plan is to partially offset the potential loss in electricity generation by using more advanced technologies for fuel combustion and better energy-saving measures. For example, the use of more up-to-date installations for gas combustion will make it possible to boost electricity production by 10-15 percent, with the volume of fuel used remaining the same. Nonetheless, Anatoliy Dyakov believes that the electric power sector has now approached the danger line beyond which its stable operation may be disrupted. A tangle of nonpayments and the absence of internal funds rob the power industry personnel of the opportunity to acquire even the most necessary items for repairs: metal, wire, and welding electrodes. In the opinion of the representatives of regional power associations, this year's repair campaign is in jeopardy. This is fraught with the danger of consumers failing to receive the necessary quantities of heat and light. A way out of this complex situation is found in a search for a mechanism to eliminate consumer nonpayments. Part of the outline for solving this difficult problem has already emerged. In particular, it is proposed to switch to a system of bills of exchange for mutual settlements between the consumers and producers of electricity. A draft for using bank bills of exchange as payment documents has already been developed by the Russian joint-stock company YeES of Russia together with an underwriting syndicate and the Russian Brokerage House. A mechanism for solving the nonpayments problem on a broad scale may come along if the project is successfully carried out.
