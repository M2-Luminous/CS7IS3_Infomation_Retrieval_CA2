ADDRESSES: Send comments to: NRTL Recognition Program, Office of Variance Determination, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, Third Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Room N3653, Washington, DC 20210. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Office of Variance Determination, NRTL Recognition Program, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, Third Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Room N3653, Washington, DC 20210. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Notice of Application Notice is hereby given that Wyle Laboratories (WL) has made application pursuant to section 6(b) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, (84 Stat. 1593, 29 U.S.C. 655), Secretary of Labor's Order No. 1&hyph;90 (55 FR 9033), and 29 CFR 1910.7 for recognition as a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory. The address of the laboratory covered by this application is: Wyle Laboratories, 7800 Governors Drive, P.O. Box 077777, Huntsville, Alabama 35807. Regarding the merits of the application, the applicant contends that it meets the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.7 for recognition to certify products in the areas of testing which it has specified. Wyle Laboratories states that its application demonstrates that for each specified item of equipment or material to be certified, it has the capability (including proper testing equipment and facilities, trained staff, written testing procedures, quality control and calibration programs) to perform testing and examination of equipment and materials for workplace safety purposes to determine conformance with appropriate product test standards. In summary, it claims that it has the experience, expertise, personnel, organization, equipment, and facilities suitable for accreditation as an OSHA Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory. The Calibration Laboratory maintains, repairs, and calibrates more than 7400 pieces of test equipment. Test equipment is available in the laboratory to perform the testing specified in the standard. If equipment is not available, it may be purchased, rented, or leased only under specified, stringent conditions. The applicant states that it has pertinent testing and certification experience. The Huntsville facility has been conducting testing related to product safety for over 30 years. Since the commercial product safety market has only recently become available, WL's experience has been in other markets including telecommunications. The applicant states the WL has tested equipment to standards which compare with UL standards for which they are requesting accreditation to test and certify as an NRTL. In addition, Wyle has had experience in the certification of products (although not necessarily related to those required by OSHA), having been a certified Department of Transportation (DOT) Third Party Testing Laboratory since July, 1985. (See Exhibit 2.A.(1), Section 6). WL's Huntsville facility employs some 350 people and has about 320,000 square feet of engineering and test facilities situated on 126 acres. The floor space of the Product Safety Testing and Certification Laboratory including the storage and office area, is 2,700 square feet. Some twenty key personnel are presently assigned to this Division including Calibration Laboratory and Quality staff. Product safety testing has been allocated 1,500 square feet of floor space. If additional floor space is necessary for product testing, WL can expand into the 320,000 square feet that is available at this facility. (See Exhibits 3.A.(1) and 2.A.(2), Appendices II and III, and IV). WL has written testing procedures and has supplied examples of typical procedures for five of the test standards for which it has applied for NRTL recognition. (See Exhibit 2.A.(2), Appendix VI). Wyle Laboratories states that all instrumentation, measuring, and test equipment used in the performance of the testing programs are calibrated in accordance with Wyle Laboratories' Quality Assurance Program. Standards used in performing all calibrations are traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) by report number and date. Where no national standards exist, the standards are traceable to international standards or the basis for calibration is otherwise documented. (See Exhibit 2.A.(1), Section 10, and Exhibit 2.A.(2), Appendix VIII, Section 12, and Appendix XII). WL has submitted an unrestricted copy of its Quality Assurance Program Manual (Exhibit 2.A.(2), Appendix VIII) which describes the overall Quality Assurance Program used at WL's Huntsville facility. The Manual includes various control procedures.
