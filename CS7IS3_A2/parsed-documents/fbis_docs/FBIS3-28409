In a television interview this morning, Secretary Ozawa said that North Korea apparently possesses nuclear weapons. But he failed to show evidence that can support his allegation of suspicion of nuclear arms development. He pointed out that North Korea is an incredibly fanatic society and that the struggle will be triggered so that the right succeeds to power after Kim is retreated and that there is a possibility that an upheaval will be touched off on the Korean peninsula.
