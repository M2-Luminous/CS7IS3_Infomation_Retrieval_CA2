Liu Xietan, deputy director of the Guangzhou Land Bureau, said a lot of mainland projects now being advertised in Hong Kong "could not be sold at such prices". Local realtors are warning that investors stand to get badly burnt if they do not do their homework before buying flats on the mainland. Favoured locations for these property scams include those which have in the past proved popular for Hong Kong residents as investment havens. These include Zhuhai, Dongguan, Zhongshan and Panyu. Not a day or night goes by that Hong Kong people are not bombarded with full-page print ads and splashy TV commercials featuring flats for sale in these locations. According to an agent at Hong Kong real estate agents Land Power, there can be as many as 30 property exhibitions on a given-weekend in Hong Kong. The asking price for many of these flats is ridiculously low -- $100,000 compared to the current asking price of $3 million for an average flat in Hong Kong. Developers also offer between $20,000 and $50,000 worth of free household appliances to the purchaser. Financing terms are also enticing. The developers advertise no down payment an interest-free mortgage, no lawyer's fees and no management fees. Hong Kong agents say they doubt developers can afford to sell the flats so cheaply. "It may be possible," said Allan Lee of Richard Ellis. "But it seems to us unrealistic for them to be able to earn a profit at these prices." He and other agents said that, at these prices, buyers could find themselves paying all sorts of extra fees in water, sewage and management fees. But the same agents agree that the ads are enticing. "Many people in Hong Kong have relatives in these areas," said one agent. "These flats are big by Hong Kong standards (more than 1,000 square feet) and they each have a balcony. "And maybe the $100,000 price tag has some kind of psychological impact," she said. But agents said the most likely reason developers offered these flats so cheaply was because they were strapped for cash. "Ordinarily, they must get the money before they actually start construction," said the Land Power representative. Other agents said it was conceivable that a developer would sell one project to raise capital for a project already in financial trouble. To the consternation of the buyers, it is usually many months down the road when they find out that the developer has taken the, money and run. They said the simple solution, was to find a reputable developer. But that was not as easy as it sounded. Most of these unscrupulous developers had received the required paperwork and licences from government officials giving them the go-ahead to develop and sell the property. Therefore, getting a look at their sales permits, pre-sale permits, construction permits and all the other documentation was usually not the problem. The documentation was valid, but maybe not the developer's resolve. One realtor who asked for anonymity said: "This sort of problem occurs in the more remote areas. In the city centre, supervision is much tighter. But, in other areas, as long as you have good connections with the government officials they will give you the documentation. In most cases, the site is too far away for them to go and investigate and find out how much work is actually going on," he said. They just give the developer all the documentation he needs." But, in many instances the authorities never check the site. They just believed the developer and approved the licence.
