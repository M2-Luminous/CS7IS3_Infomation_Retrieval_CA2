The public debt in government titles totaled $53.6 billion in April, representing a 6.1 percent increase compared with March. The domestic debt represented 9.3 percent of GDP in April, while it was only 8.7 percent in March. This is due to the increase in domestic interest rates and to the inflow of foreign financial investments, which forces the Central Bank to issue debt titles to prevent an expansion of the monetary base. The effective interest rate -- the real interest rate plus the inflation rate -- jumped from 46.42 percent in March to 46.49 percent in April.
