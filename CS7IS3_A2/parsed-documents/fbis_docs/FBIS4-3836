This will play a positive role in further strengthening and improving enterprise ideological and political work. On the whole, enterprise ideological and political work has been strengthened. Thanks to their awareness, positive attitude, and forceful measures, some enterprises have done a good job in this field and have scored marked achievements. However, there are some localities and enterprises which still lag behind in ideological and political work and have failed to meet the developing needs of reform, opening up, and the modernization program. This state of affairs must change. We are promoting economic structural reform amid the swift operation of the national economy this year and are attaining rapid growth in the national economy amid the speedy process of switching systems. Hence, we are faced with a large number of contradictions and difficult problems. Different understandings of specific reform and construction issues is quite natural. When reform has reached a crucial stage, it gives rise to confused and complicated thinking and creates difficulties for ideological and political work. For this reason, ideological and political work is indispensable and well worth doing. Enterprises constitute an essential factor in the market, while workers are an important factor in enterprises. While strengthening and improving ideological and political work in the new situation, the most important thing is to proceed from the reality of workers' thinking, straighten out ideological problems, resolve contradictions, arouse all positive factors, turn negative factors into positive ones, and guide the enthusiasm of the broad ranks of workers to running the enterprise well and fighting for the supreme objective. To straighten out ideological problems and resolve contradictions, the fundamental thing is to arm the broad ranks of workers with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line and policies, and to improve the ideological and political qualities of cadres and the masses. We should continue to publicize and study volume three of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" and the Decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. In propaganda work, we should give explanations in connection with practice to allow everyone to understand the meaning rather than repeat or copy what books say. Theory is fundamental. Only when we seek unity of thinking theoretically, in line and in terms of major principles and policies, can the ideological problems be readily resolved. It is man's social being which determines his thinking. The limitations of man's social being are inevitably reflected in his thinking. Therefore, talking frequently about the situation, the overall situation, achievements and experiences, and difficulties and problems should be essential contents of ideological and political work. Through publicity on the current situation, we should enable the broad ranks of workers to have a correct understanding of the major economic structural reform plans introduced this year and have confidence in the policies and measures adopted by the government to stabilize the market and prices and dispel their misgivings. Through such education, we should also encourage them to keep the overall situation in mind, correctly understand the interest relations between the individual and the collective, between the part and the whole, and between the immediate and the long-term; stress idealism, discipline, unity, and the overall situation; and understand the reform, support the reform, and resolutely plunge themselves into the reform. Showing concern for the well-being of the masses, attentively listening to their voices, and resolving difficulties for them are indispensable in straightening out ideological problems and minimizing contradictions. Our ideological and political work should be focused on propaganda. But this is not enough. Ideological and political work should be closely connected with the people's daily lives. Comrade Mao Zedong once said: If you want the masses to support the revolutionary war, you should show concern for their well-being. When we want the masses to support our reform today, we should also show concern for their well-being. Some workers' incomes have dropped because of the poor performance of enterprises. What should be done? Some enterprises are at the verge of bankruptcy and the workers are worried about their future? How should this problem be resolved? Because of poor social order in some localities, the masses lack a sense of security. How should we put an end to this state of affairs? With a high sense of responsibility to the people, enterprise leaders and leading local cadres should make strenuous efforts to resolve all of these problems, which are closely related to the interests of the masses, particularly "rice bags" and "vegetable baskets." Leading cadres should set an example, be strict with themselves, keep themselves free of corruption, change their style, overcome bureaucracy and formalism, and resolutely fight against negative and corrupt practices. This will be of great significance to straightening out ideological problems and resolving contradictions. We should realize that the broad ranks of workers have the overall situation in mind. They have shown understanding of the difficulties and problems encountered in the course of reform. They do not care much about their limited benefits and making some temporary sacrifices for a period of time. But they cannot bear the attitude of a handful of leading cadres, who put on airs but who show no interest in the well-being of the masses. They cannot tolerate certain leading cadres, who, taking advantage of reform, abuse their power and office and seek private gain at public expense. To straighten out such ideological problems and resolve contradictions, fine sounding words will be to no avail. The only effective method is to take practical action to fight corruption, run a clean administration, and change work style. Strengthening and improving ideological and political work is the job of political work departments and workers, as well as the whole party. Besides state enterprises, township, neighborhood, the three kinds of foreign-funded, and private enterprises all need enhanced and improved ideological and political work. Enterprise ideological and political work constitutes an important component of modern enterprise management. Numerous facts have proved that wise and successful enterprise leaders are those who pay great attention to ideological and political work and who are good at doing such work. How to do well enterprise ideological and political work in the new situation is a big and meaningful new topic. So long as we rouse ourselves, boldly make explorations, and think and do more to straighten out ideological problems and resolve contradictions at this crucial stage of reform, we will certainly be able to win the battle of ideological and political work and create more favorable conditions for "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability."
