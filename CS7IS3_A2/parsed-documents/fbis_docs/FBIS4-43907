"We want to win. I am not counting on a place, but on victory," Scharping said in his policy statement at the special party conference in Halle on Wednesday [22 June]. The Social Democrats are prepared to take on government responsibility again. To achieve this aim, the SPD will have to make an effort during the next few months. "The change will not come about automatically; it has to be fought for." After the disappointing results of the European elections, all Social Democrats must realize that they have to fight with even more clarity and determination. "You cannot look ahead if you hang your head," he told the 500 delegates in Halle. Scharping said that directions will be decided at the Bundestag election. "The decision will be whether wariness, lack of solidarity, and irresponsibility will keep spreading like mildew, or whether the opportunity for change is used to return to reason and tolerance." Scharping accused the Federal Government of having changed the social climate through selfishness and recklessness. A strong Social Democratic force is also necessary to ward off nationalism and right-wing extremism, Scharping said. He said he is sure that Chancellor Kohl's policy of "going on the same way as ever" cannot be sustained until October. A big majority in unified Germany wants to see a change toward new politics. This is only possible with an SPD-led government. Instead of a coalition debate, the SPD has to conduct a reform debate. "We will counteract conservative restoration with a policy of reforms. To achieve this, we are looking for wide alliances with all groups of our society." He cannot promise that a government led by him will immediately solve all problems, said Scharping, who is to be elected candidate for chancellor at the end of the one-day party conference. "But we promise that we will give the people courage again, we will strengthen the feeling of solidarity, and open politics to reforms." An SPD government will immediately embark upon cutting unemployment step by step. It will not increase the tax burden and lower taxes and rates in those fields where they impair growth and employment. The SPD will make sure that the unconstitutional taxation of the minimum subsistence level will be stopped as of 1996 and that a child benefit of 250 marks is paid for each child. Another priority of an SPD government will be an ecological modernization of industry. This will require a tax reform that promotes environment-friendly measures and levies taxes on behavior that harms the environment. The SPD will maintain its objective of withdrawing from nuclear energy in the medium term. Scharping warned against leaving the competence in environmental matters to the Greens. The welfare state must also be restabilized. The welfare state is not "the ambulance" of society, but a clear constitutional mandate, Scharping said.
