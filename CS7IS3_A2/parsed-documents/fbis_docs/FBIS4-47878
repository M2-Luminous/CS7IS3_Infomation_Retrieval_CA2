FBIS4-47878 "drafr087_c_94031" FBIS-AFR-94-087 Daily Report 5 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Natal's Frank Mdlalose Natal's Frank Mdlalose MB0505102394 Johannesburg SAPA in English 0901 GMT 5 May 94 MB0505102394 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Ulundi May 5 SAPA -- Dr. Frank Themba Mdlalose, Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] premier designate for KwaZulu-Natal has had a long and illustrious political career spanning about 19 years. Educated at St Francis High School, Mariannhill, outside Durban, the good-natured Mdlalose matriculated in 1949. He then attended the University of Fort Hare where he obtained an education diploma. From 1950 until 1953 he was the African National Congress Youth League branch president. Mdlalose continued his studies at the University of Natal and in 1958 he obtained his MB CH B degree, and became a resident doctor at Durban's King Edward Hospital. Subsequently he became a medical practitioner in Atteridgeville near Pretoria, and Steadville and Madadeni in northern Natal. Mdlalose joined the IFP at its launch in 1975. In 1978 Mdlalose was appointed minister of interior in the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly [KLA] in Ulundi -- a position he held for five years. He was then appointed minister of health. Mdlalose has won the respect and admiration of political friend and foe alike as an outspoken and gentle-mannered politician. He has often taken a more moderate line than his KLA counterparts. Mdlalose has played a vital role in steering the IFP through the hurly-burly of democracy negotiations. He was appointed minister without portfolio to take on this mantle as a negotiator at the World Trade Centre. Rumours abounded in 1993 that he had attempted to resign but was persuaded otherwise by close friend and IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi. A subsequent car crash in which Mdlalose sustained serious injuries is still shrouded in mystery. Mdlalose was born in Nquthu, northern Natal to Jaconia Mdlalose, a general dealer and Tabitha Mthembu, a teacher. He is married to Eunice Nokuthula Sikhosane and has three sons and two daughters. His interests include child welfare, tennis and boxing.
