Official results issued by the Supreme Court on Monday [14 March] gave the Action Committee for Renewal (CAR) 36 seats, making it Togo's leading political party after last month's two-round vote. Seven seats went to its ally the Union for Democracy (UTD), giving them an absolute majority in parliament which has 81 members. The Togolese People's Rally (RPT) supporting military ruler Gnassingbe Eyadema got 35 seats, and another pro-Eyadema movement, the Union for Justice and Democracy, won two. CAR chief Yao Agboyibor immediately hailed the result as a victory for the Togolese people and said he was sure Eyadema's consultations on the appointment of new government leaders "will lead to choices in line with the voting. Any other outcome would be a scandal." Agboyibor, 51, a lawyer, was widely expected to be Eyadema's choice as premier, since under the Constitution the head of state has to pick a prime minister from the parliamentary majority. But UTD leader Edem Kodjo sent shockwaves through opposition ranks within hours of the results being announced when he repudiated a mid-election pact with the CAR. He reopened the bidding by stating flatly that nobody could claim the 41-seat absolute majority in Parliament without his movement, and the UDT was not simply to be accounted part of just any coalition. "We want our friends in the CAR to take us seriously," he said. "We are a pivotal party and intend remaining so." [passage omitted] Agboyibor and Kodjo had a meeting scheduled for Monday but it was cancelled. Eyadema, who took power in 1967 as army chief of staff after leading a coup in 1963, accordingly began consultations with all party leaders on Tuesday with his supporters in an upbeat mood. They remembered their forecast when the two main opposition parties set up a joint front last month that it was only a "facade of a coalition and will break up at thefirst opportunity." The opposition split has given him more freedom of manoeuvre and he may well push for a government of national union. He has argued for such a system as a cure for the tiny West African state's economic ills and tribal strife since his re-election as president last August. [passage omitted]
