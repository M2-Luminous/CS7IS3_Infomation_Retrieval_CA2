The UAE has always been with unity, particularly Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan, who supported Yemen unity. We do not believe any Arab or foreign state will recognize this secession declaration announced by 'Ali Salim al-Bid, because it is unconstitutional. We do not want to impose unity by force, but (?through peaceful means). The whole Yemeni people in the southern, eastern, northern, and western governorates support unity. Those who are imposing state authority in the southern governorates are government forces. These forces are not from the northern governorates, but from northern and southern governorates. The northern governorates are not imposing unity on the southern governorates. There is readiness for unity. As it was achieved peacefully, it will continue so. All the Yemeni people support unity.
