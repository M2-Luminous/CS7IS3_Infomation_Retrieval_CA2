Major Rob Annink, spokesman for the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR), is quoted by REUTERS as saying that the `(Moslem) army seems to have gained some territory around Zavidovici, about three to four kilometres worth.' Annink said that the Moslems had captured some territory also around Ribnica, Serb town near Tuzla in the north, on the road to Sarajevo. U.N. observers registered 1,700 explosions between Ribnica and Doboj, a stretch of 45 kilometres, on Saturday. Observers believe that the fighting is a prelude to a full-scale battle for control of the northern corridor through the Posavina (Sava river valley) region which links the east and west of the Bosnian Serb republic. Flouting the one-month Bosnia-wide truce, Moslem Army Commander Rasim Delic on Thursday urged that the Moslems and their new allies -- the Croats -- join forces and mount an all-out war against the Serbs.
