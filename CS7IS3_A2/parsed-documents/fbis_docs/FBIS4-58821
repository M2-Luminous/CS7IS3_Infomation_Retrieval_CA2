FBIS4-58821 "drnes089_n_94008" FBIS-NES-94-089 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 LEBANON Hizballah Derides Israeli Conditions on Resistance Hizballah Derides Israeli Conditions on Resistance NC0605171494 Beirut AL-'AHD in Arabic 22 Apr 94 p 3 NC0605171494 Beirut AL-'AHD Arabic BFN [Excerpt] Hizballah has issued the following statement in response to the enemy's demands calling for striking at the Resistance forces in the south and in the occupied territories: The conditions set by the enemy leaders and their demand to disarm the Resistance whether in the south or in the occupied territories reveal the extent of the enemy's concern over the effectiveness of the Resistance and its fighters in dealing blows to the enemy's security status and occupation presence. Although the enemy's conditions reveal a blatant Zionist intransigence that is politically and militarily supported by the United States, they demonstrate the reality of the enemy's chaos and confusion. The Zionist leaders have been diligently trying to convince their settlers that they can play simultaneously the games of force, negotiation, and superiority under the slogan of security that is unshakable and invincible. The statement adds: While these conditions demonstrate the increasing Zionist deadlock, the enemy might yet try to end this deadlock through the readiness of some parties to discuss these conditions, as happened in the case of the representatives of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance in Jordan. The statement believes that the enemy's conditions are aimed at making the Arab countries play the role of police in defending its security without changing its policy of aggression. The statement reiterates Hizballah's outright rejection of these conditions and calls for confronting them firmly and forcibly. The statement warns against suspicious voices that are trying to depict the recent confrontations in the south and the subsequent Zionist-Lahdist attacks as internal feuding and sectarian sedition. The statement adds that the bombardment of Sidon and the atrocities against the inhabitants of 'Aramta represent a Zionist criminal act. The killing of some Lahdist agents by the Resistance men is only a link in the chain of the honorable national responsibilities and duties. [passage omitted]
