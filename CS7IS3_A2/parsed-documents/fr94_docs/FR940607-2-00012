FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Annika L. O'Hara or David R. Boyland, Office of Countervailing Investigations, U.S. Department of Commerce, room 3099, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;4198 or 482&hyph;0588, respectively. Countervailing Duty Order In accordance with section 705(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (``the Act'') (19 U.S.C. section 1671d(a)), on April 11, 1994, the Department of Commerce (``the Department'') made its final determination that manufacturers, producers or exporters in Italy of grain-oriented electrical steel receive benefits which constitute subsidies within the meaning of the countervailing duty law (59 FR 18357, April 18, 1994). On May 27, 1994, in accordance with section 705(d) of the Act, the U.S. International Trade Commission (``ITC'') notified the Department of its final affirmative determination that imports of grain-oriented electrical steel from Italy are materially injuring a U.S. industry. Therefore, pursuant to section 706(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. section 1671e(a)(1)), the Department hereby directs U.S. Customs officers to assess a countervailing duty equal to the amount of the estimated net subsidy on all entries of grain-oriented electrical steel from Italy. This countervailing duty will be assessed on all unliquidated entries of grain-oriented electrical steel from Italy which were entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption, on or after February 1, 1994, the date on which the Department published its preliminary countervailing duty determination in the Federal Register . On or after the date of publication of this notice, U.S. Customs officers must require, at the same time as importers would normally deposit duties on this merchandise, a cash deposit of 24.42 percent ad valorem for all entries of grain-oriented electrical steel from Italy. This determination constitutes a countervailing duty order with respect to grain-oriented electrical steel from Italy pursuant to section 706 of the Act (19 U.S.C. section 1671e). Interested parties may contact the Central Records Unit, room B&hyph;099, Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230, for copies of an updated list of orders currently in effect. Scope of Order The product covered by this order is grain-oriented silicon electrical steel, which is a flat-rolled alloy steel product containing by weight at least 0.6 percent of silicon, not more than 0.08 percent of carbon, not more than 1.0 percent of aluminum, and no other element in an amount that would give the steel the characteristics of another alloy steel, of a thickness of no more than 0.56 millimeters, in coils of any width, or in straight lengths which are of a width measuring at least 10 times the thickness, as currently classifiable in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (``HTS'') under item numbers 7225.10.0030, 7226.10.1030, 7226.10.5015, and 7226.10.5065.
