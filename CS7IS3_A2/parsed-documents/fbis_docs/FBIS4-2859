According to Supreme People's Court President Ren Jianxin, China's courts at various levels have handled some 1,900 cases of patent disputes and some 1,600 have been settled as of the end of 1993. At the same time, the patent administrative organs at various levels handled more than 2,200 patent dispute cases and settled some 1,700 of them. The serious handling of a large number of patent cases has protected the legitimate rights and interests of patent-holders, yielding a good effect at home and abroad. Some patent-holders involved in patent disputes have the following to say: [Wang Yongmin, identified by screen caption as inventor of the five-stroke Chinese character identifier] It has been 10 years since the Patent Law promulgation. The law has protected the patent of the five-stroke Chinese character identifier. Many factories have signed agreements with me. One or two factories that did not and violated my patent rights have been fined by the court. [Zhang Li, identified by screen caption as inventor of the Lunar Vehicle brand magnetic massager] In my view, we must not tolerate patent violators. We should use the law as a weapon to effectively protect patent right and sternly deal with the violators. However, the Patent Law's implementation is not yet fully satisfactory. Many people do not understand the Patent Law. It is necessary to step up the publicity for it and make it known to everyone. [Reporter] Director China Patent Office Gao Lulin believes that the increase of patent disputes indicates both an enhanced awareness of self-protection on the part of the patent-holders and the ignorance of many people with respect to patent. For this reason, the number of patent dispute cases will continue to rise.
