FR941125-0-00006 FR941125-0-00003 The comment period for the OCC's proposal closed on May 18, 1994. Among the 69 commenters, 61 were banks, thrifts or holding companies; five were financial institution trade groups; one was a public accounting firm; one was an investment banking firm, and one was a clearinghouse association. Fifty-five of the commenters opposed the proposal to include net unrealized holding gains on available-for-sale securities in Tier 1 capital. Opposition to the proposal focused on the belief that including the net unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities in regulatory capital would result in excessive volatility in regulatory capital levels. Many commenters observed that temporary market conditions could cause banks to change capital levels. Although an interest rate change causing a change in a security's market value may be temporary, the fluctuation in Tier 1 capital could trigger more permanent regulatory provisions and sanctions tied to a bank's level of capitalization. For example, a change in capital could limit a bank's ability to acquire brokered deposits or increase a bank's deposit insurance premiums. In an extreme case, a bank could be subject to prompt corrective action restrictions, sanctions, and penalties. A few commenters were critical of the market value accounting approach. These commenters believe that recognizing unrealized gains and losses directly in capital would present a misleading report of a bank's financial condition. Although these unrealized gains and losses may reflect market value, banks may never realize the dollar values of these unrealized gains and losses. Several commenters believe that FAS 115 is not consistent in its approach because it requires banks to account for certain assets at fair market value while liabilities are valued at cost. These commenters believe that by focusing only on certain assets, FAS 115 does not properly consider the effects of market changes on other components of bank balance sheets. Several commenters opposed this proposal because of another recent OCC notice of proposed rulemaking to link the lending limits on loans to one borrower to the capital adequacy rules (59 FR 6593, February 11, 1994). These commenters observed that if the OCC adopts both proposals, an unacceptable level of volatility would be introduced to bank lending limits. As a result, the capital rules could restrain a bank's ability to lend to a single borrower in times of rising interest rates. Of the ten commenters favoring the proposal, eight believe that the OCC should make its capital adequacy rules consistent with GAAP. Several of these commenters indicated that they would incur additional recordkeeping expenses if the regulatory definition of capital differs from the GAAP definition. These commenters believe that the regulatory burden would be increased by excluding the FAS 115 adjustment from Tier 1 capital. However, several commenters from smaller banks contradicted this view. These commenters stated that adoption of the proposal to include net unrealized holding gains and losses in stockholders' equity would increase regulatory burden because they would have to change their investment and portfolio management procedures.
