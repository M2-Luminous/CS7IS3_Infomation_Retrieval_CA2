In spite of some mediation attempts to reduce the tension, the Jordanian-Saudi relationship has now plummeted to an all-time low, especially in the wake of King Husayn's visit to the holy land to perform the minor pilgrimage. The surprise then was that Saudi officials did not observe the simplest rules of tact and protocol stipulated by international norms. What happened last week was another negative incident that reflects a Saudi desire to escalate the official quarrel. Saudi Arabia has issued an official statement saying it is taking care of the reconstruction of holy sites through UNESCO. The seriousness of this statement is that it came only hours after Jordan's grand, official celebration of the unveiling of the dome and a plaque that set 18 April, 1994 as the date the reconstruction of the Dome of the Rock was finished and the repair work on the Salah-al-Din pulpit, burned by the Zionists in 1968 when they burned the al-Aqsa Mosque, was begun. Jordan chose not to reply officially to the Saudi statement, leaving facts on the ground to speak for themselves. Except for an editorial in a daily, all comments by Saudi media at home and abroad which elaborated on the Saudi official statement were absolutely ignored by Jordan. As background to this incident, it should be mentioned that three years ago, UNESCO proposed a plan to refurbish the al-Aqsa Mosque, in coordination with Israel, since it is the occupying power that controls Palestinian land. Israel encouraged this step. Jordan, however, rejected this approach when it received a message, just like all other countries, to contribute to the reconstruction of the al-Aqsa Mosque.
