At a press conference given by the current session of the National People's Congress (NPC), Qu Geping, chairman of the NPC Environmental Protection Committee, said that the country's environmental quality has "basically remained at the same level of the 1980's." He said that economic losses caused by environmental pollution in China top about 100 billion yuan every year. Asked about Chinese Government's spendings on environment, he said that China spends 20 billion yuan on environment protection every year, accounting for 0.7 percent of its annual gross national product. The figure leads all other developing countries in the world, he said. He cited the example of Beijing city, which spends an amount of money that accounts for 2.4 percent of its annual gross domestic product every year. In the past decade, the city has spent over ten billion yuan on projects for curbing pollutions. He noted that the government imposes very low fines on enterprises which violate environmental protection rules, prompting some enterprises to pay fines in exchange for government consent on their spoiling of environment. The total fines of last year only accounted for 0.11 percent of the country's annual industrial output. "We have raised the minimum of the fines by one-third last year... and we are going to make it even higher, so as to compel the enterprises to clean up the environment instead of just paying fines," he said. Asked about the actual figures for cancers and respiratory diseases caused by pollution in China, he said that China has yet to compile a set of complete figures on the impact of environmental pollution on people's health. "It is a very complicated job. We are still carrying out researching programs in this regard," he said. He said that the Chinese Government did not make public to the people the World Bank reports on pollution-related diseases in the country, because it has to consult with relevant departments to "verify the preciseness of the international figures." Asked about China taking out gall bile from living bears, Qu said that China's wild life protection policy is to "carefully protect, actively reproduce and rationally utilize" wild animals. "China has a large number of bears," he said. "On this precondition, we should consider utilizing them for medical purposes." He said that keeping one bear for medical use will avoid the killing of 220 bears. And the bear will not suffer great pains.
