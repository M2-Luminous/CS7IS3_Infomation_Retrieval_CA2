He told Russian Deputy Premier Yuriy Yarov, who met him at the airport, that he hoped his one-day visit would serve to step up Polish-Russian cooperation. A senior Polish Foreign Ministry source who asked not to be identified told Interfax Pawlak's trip was unexpected to many in Poland. Even President Lech Walesa told the Polish news agency PAP on Monday that he had known nothing about Pawlak's plans to go to Russia, the source said. He said the main purpose of the visit was to end the present-day stagnation in Polish-Russian trade and economic relations, primarily caused by the red tape of officials in both countries. The premier hopes to solve some key problems that have not been tackled for two or three years, namely, he wishes to reach agreement with Russia on the mutual cancellation of debts and terms for trade and economic cooperation. Warsaw will be satisfied with the visit if, during it, deadlines are set for the solution of five or six major economic problems and specific officials are put in charge of the work, the source said. He said Poland did not attach prime importance to a package of accords ready to be signed in Moscow, which includes agreements on antimonopoly measures and on regulations on the employment of Russian citizens in Poland and Polish citizens in Russia. On Tuesday, Pawlak will meet Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and will be having talks at the Finance and Agriculture Ministries and the Committee on Industrial Policy. He will return to Poland the same day.
