Vitaliy Churkin Retires From Bosnia Affairs?"] [Excerpt] In yesterday's talks with Andrey Kozyrev, his French counterpart Allain Juppe backed the idea for a summit with Russia, the EC, the United Nations, and the United States taking part (this idea was approved in a telephone conversation the day before by Pavel Grachev and Pentagon chief William Perry). A conference of the heads of interested countries' Foreign Ministries is to get down to preparing the summit. The ministers' conference, Kozyrev and Juppe thought, could discuss the report of the "contact group" which is starting talks with the Serbs and Muslims. In the meantime, Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian president's special envoy, indicated yesterday that he was not going to play the leading role in this group (although it is made up of his "counterparts in the settlement" -- for example, U.S. special envoy Charles Redman) and would only "from time to time" participate in its work. Churkin's place in the group will be taken by Aleksey Nikiforov, a diplomat expert in Balkan affairs. Time will tell whether this is really a quiet removal of Churkin from a Yugoslav settlement (in a sequel to the two-week-old story where he first sharply criticized a part of the Bosnian Serbs for "extremism," and then rumors of his certain "differences with Kozyrev" began to creep around Moscow). For the time being, Churkin will be busy preparing Russia's signing of the "Partnership for Peace" with NATO. Aleksey Nikiforov earlier worked in the USSR Embassy in Belgrade, then in the East European department of the Foreign Ministry, and took part in the early stages of the Geneva talks on ex-Yugoslavia.
