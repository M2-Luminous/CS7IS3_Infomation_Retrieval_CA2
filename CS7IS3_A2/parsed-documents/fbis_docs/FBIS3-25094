According to these first results from 11 constituencies, the Togolese People's Rally is leading with six seats, followed closely by the Action Committee for Renewal and the Togolese Union for Democracy, which will go to the second round of elections in several constituencies. [passage omitted] According to the electoral code, the complete results of the first round of elections must be communicated to the Supreme Court by the evening of 9 February so that they can be announced. In an evening radio and television program on the elections at the Palais des Congres yesterday, CEN Chairman Kue Sipohon Gaba admitted the slowness with which the votes are being counted. This slowness is due to lack of sufficient means to count the votes. According to the general opinion, voting took place in satisfactory conditions. Opposition candidates and those from the presidential group unanimously admitted this, although they pointed out certain shortcomings in the organization.
