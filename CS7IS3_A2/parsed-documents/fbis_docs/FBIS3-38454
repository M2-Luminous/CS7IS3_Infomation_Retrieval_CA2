Earlier there was talk of the British and French Governments in particular considering such a withdrawal. According to The Hague, such a withdrawal would result in the "moral bankruptcy" of the international community. Defense Minister Ter Beek considers the humanitarian task of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] in Bosnia as being "of great importance" and the deployment of Netherlands troops as "exceptionally meaningful," the minister said in Parliament on Tuesday [1 February]. Parliament was informed of recent details concerning the stationing of the 1,230 troops from the Army's reinforced Light Mobile Battalion in central and eastern Bosnia. Parliament was in full agreement over the stationing of the troops. Senior officials, who met with the European Union's Political Affairs Committee, confirmed in Brussels on Tuesday that none of the member states was considering a unilateral withdrawal of troops from Bosnia. According to Ter Beek, the departure of the United Nations from Bosnia would "increase fighting and human rights violations. It would mean accepting aggression, atrocities, and rule of the strongest. That is too high a price." Ter Beek was pleased with Parliament's support for sending troops to the Muslim enclaves of Srebrenica and Zepa, which must be protected. "The Netherlands will keep its word, also in difficult circumstances," the minister stated. His fellow party member, Van Traa, stressed that Parliament would continue to support the dispatch of the Light Mobile Battalion even if there were losses on the Netherlands side. He wanted to dispel the suggestion that The Hague "would get cold feet if body bags started coming back to Schiphol airport." Ter Beek and General Van der Vlis, chief of the defense staff, reassured Parliament that the Netherlands ground troops are going to Bosnia "well trained, sufficiently armed, and highly motivated." The 750 men of the Light Mobile Battalion are carrying out their mission at the UN request in Srebrenica and Zepa. The logistics support unit of 480 men is stationed in Lukavac, 140 and 190 kilometers from Srebrenica and Zepa respectively. In spite of this, Ter Beek considers this to be the best location as the town is close to the reopened Tuzla airfield and can be easily reached from Zagreb and Split. Ter Beek confirmed that the Security Council and NATO Council are required to give express permission for carrying out air strikes against Serbian targets. These would be reprisal bombings and would make UNPROFOR a party to the conflict. The minister sees the risks of this as too high. Air support can, however, be granted for the direct defense of the Netherlands units. Also, if these units are obstructed from carrying out their task or if they are met with violence in carrying out their task, then both air support by NATO and ground support by other UNPROFOR contingents may be granted. One 1 March, a Netherlands brigade general is to be appointed chief of staff of the Bosnia-Herzegovina command in Kiseljac, headed by General Rose, of Britain, for one year. According to Ter Beek, the appointment to this "senior, difficult and important position" is partly due to the Netherlands' substantial contribution to UNPROFOR.
