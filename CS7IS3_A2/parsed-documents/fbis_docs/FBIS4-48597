FBIS4-48597 "drafr099_c_94003" FBIS-AFR-94-099 Daily Report 20 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA De Klerk Denies `Land Deal' De Klerk Denies `Land Deal' MB2005184694 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1738 GMT 20 May 94 MB2005184694 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [By Guy Rogers and Patrick Bulger] [Text] Johannesburg May 20 SAPA -- President Nelson Mandela said on Friday the first he heard of the "land deal" between KwaZulu and the former South African Government was in media reports. In his reaction to the same issue, which hit the headlines on Friday morning, former President F W de Klerk denied the transaction was a "secret deal" or that it was hatched up to draw the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] into the elections. The two leaders were reacting to a report that three million hectares of land were transferred to Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini under the Ingonyama [King's] Land Trust Act in return for the IFP's participation in the April poll. In its front-page story, the WEEKLY MAIL AND GUARDIAN called it a "highly secretive deal". A senior source in the Department of Regional and Land Affairs, who did not want to be named, told SAPA the impression he had gained was the deal had been decided in talks between Mr Mandela, former President F W de Klerk and IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi. But the statement from Mr Mandela's office on Friday night said he wished "to state categorically that he only became aware of the land deal today". Neither he nor any official in his African National Congress had been involved in discussions on the alleged deal. Mr de Klerk said there was no truth in the allegation by the WEEKLY MAIL that he had "secretly" handed land to King Goodwill. The transaction had its origin in the adoption of the KwaZulu Ingonyama Trust Bill, which was openly debated and adopted by the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly (KLA) -- "so there can be no question of any kind of secrecy or of any action 'behind the backs of the people'." Mr de Klerk said the bill was presented to him for signature on April 25. In terms of his constitutional duties he was obliged to approve legislation which had ben duly adopted by the KLA on matters which fell within its area of competance. "I nevertheless took special steps before signing... to ascertain whether it did, in fact, fall within the competence (of the KLA). "I was assured that in terms of Act No 21 of 1971 it did." Mr de Klerk said the purpose of the act was not to place any obstacle in the way of future land redistribution or to limit the powers of any future government. Neither was the transaction part of a deal between the government, the Zulu king, the IFP and Mr Mandela to ensure Inkatha's participation in the election, as had been alleged. A statement from Home Affairs Minister and IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi said accusations of a "secretive" deal were nothing but "cheap politicking and mischief-making by people who do not want peace in our troubled land". He said the intention of the Ingonyama Trust Act was to "return the land to the tribes and communities to whom it originally belonged before it was taken away by statutory prescription after the Zulu conquest. "It is our tradition that all land belongs to the king, who holds it in trust for the people. He cannot dispose of it in terms of the act." Senior officials in the Department of Regional and Land Affairs told SAPA it was widely understood the land transaction, involving three million hectares, was a deal linked to a constitutional settlement whose effect was aimed at ending the IFP's elections boycott. The effect of the legislation passed was to exempt KwaZulu tribal land from the provision that all self-governing territories land was to become the property of central government under the new constitution. One official who did not want to be named said KwaZulu government officials made several approaches to the department's legal advisers for assistance in drawing up the legislation. They had been refused on the grounds that the self-governing territories drafted their own legislation for the final approval of the state president. However, their approaches eventually resulted in the department's legal advisers going to Ulundi on April 21 to draw up the law in conjunction with the KwaZulu government's legal advisers. The law was passed by the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly on April 22 and was approved by Mr de Klerk on April 25 when Parliament sat to pass constitutional amendments whose effect was to draw the IFP into the elections. The amendments conferred greater powers on provincial structures and secured the position of King Goodwill in Natal/KwaZulu's executive structures. The WEEKLY MAIL reported the deal took ANC Chief Negotiator Cyril Ramaphosa and new Lands Minister Derek Hanekom by surprise. The story claimed the deal left little land for redistribution under the new government's land redistribution policies. In a statement, Mr Hanekom said he became aware of the land deal only after enquiries by the media. "It has been ascertained that senior leaders of both the IFP and the ANC in Natal had no knowledge of the passage of this act. "The Ministry of Land Affairs is deeply concerned about this issue and is at the moment investigating both the process that led to the passage of this act as well as its legal implications," he said. Mr Mandela said on Friday night he would issue a more comprehensive statement as soon as he had studied the act and consulted all the concerned parties.
