The meeting was attended by officials in charge of concerned departments. Comrades attending the meeting were of the opinion that, under socialist market economic conditions, it had become increasingly important to adopt new methods in line with market economic work to guide economic performance. They said: Currently, we should improve the overall coordination of economic performance in accordance with the new characteristics of the market economy, stressing "overall" and "coordination." We should ensure that the economy develops in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner by exercising regulation and control over economic performance in a timely fashion. The primary purpose of the meeting was to study how to establish a system for holding meetings on the overall coordination of economic performance. The meeting also seriously analyzed current economic performance and studied ways to further improve the overall coordination of economic performance, to coordinate relevant policies, and to implement relevant measures. While analyzing the current economic situation, especially the situation of state-owned enterprises, Wang Zhongyu, minister in charge of the State Economic and Trade Commission, said: First of all, over the last few years the state has adopted many policies and mesaures aimed at state-owned enterprises, and party committees and governments at all levels and enterprises themselves have done a great deal of work; as a result, state-owned enterprises' conditions have improved. State-owned enterprises have made and will continue to make great contributions to the country's reform and development. Second, we should pay great attention to and strive to solve difficulties and problems related to some enterprises' production and management. Some specific requirements and time are needed to solve these problems. Third, state-owned enterprises have vitality; we are full of confidence in improving their performance. During the first quarter of this year, some new developments occurred in state-owned enterprises. By conducting a pragmatic analysis, we can find that state-owned enterprises have improved in some way and have developed in the right direction. Because of this, state-owned enterprises over the last few years have been able to cope with various negative effects (including adjustments in coal, electricity, oil, and transportation prices) and have provided the state with a large amount of wealth. As the measures to reform the financial, taxation, and foreign exchange systems are being carried out, the new systems have basically functioned normally. During a period of time to come, we should make special efforts to improve work related to state-owned enterprises. We should make further efforts to transform enterprises' operating mechanisms and to establish a new enterprise system. We also should do a good job in experimenting with the enterprise bankruptcy system, clearing up enterprises' debts, increasing enterprises' own funds, limiting enterprises' production and reducing their stocks, improving enterprises' profitability, and improving enterprise management to raise work related to state-owned enterprises to a new level. Those attending the meeting included officials in charge of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, Ministry of Coal Industry, Ministry of Electronics Industry, Ministry of Machine-Building Industry, Ministry of Chemical Industry, Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources, Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Communications, Ministry of Internal Trade, Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the China National Textile Council, the China National Light Industry Council, the State Administration of Taxation, and the State Statistics Bureau.
