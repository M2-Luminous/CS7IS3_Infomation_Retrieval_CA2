Officials of the International Trade and Industry Ministry (MITI) said the decision, which has already been conveyed to South Africa, will be officially announced at the Group of Seven summit in Naples next month. The insurance coverage is part of a package of Japanese measures to aid South Africa's new administration under President Nelson Mandela, officials said. Yen-based loans will also be offered. MITI officials said the decision is in response to a recent U.S. request that industrialized nations increase aid to Pretoria for its economic rehabilitation program. The officials said the new insurance coverage is expected to generate more involvement by Japanese companies in South Africa's markets.
