In the meantime, Shim'on Peres, his foreign minister, has threatned that unless the Palestinians accede to Israel's terms regarding the crossings and control of strategic points Israel will give priority to the Syrian track. Thus, instead of responding to the clarion call for peace issued by the Geneva summit between al-Asad and Clinton, Israel once again embarks on prevarication, procrastination, and blackmail, and continues to deal with the Arabs from the standpoint of a brute force of occupation that turns up its nose to justice and international law and UN resolutions, conducting itself as if the Arabs are dying to pick up whatever crumbs of their occupied territory it will be prepared to cede. Such an attitude once more underscores Israel's determination to swallow up Arab territory and conclude separate deals that do not approximate the kind of true and dignified peace that the world wants and Bill Clinton endorsed at the historic Geneva summit. The referendum in the Golan proposed by Rabin has amazed the world and the media, which interpreted it as an open maneuver to dodge the goals of a fair and comprehensive peace endorsed by the Geneva summit and full implementation of UN Security resolutions and the land-for-peace formula without prevarication or trickery. The Golan is occupied Syrian territory and the proposed referendum is an open transgression of international law and the Geneva Conventions and UN resolutions. An occupying power has no business holding a referendum on the fate of territory it cannot rightly claim. There are 100,000 displaced Syrian nationals waiting for peace to come so they can return to their homes. Rabin's proposal has surprised a world convinced that short of the entire Golan being handed back to Syria, Middle East peace remains an impossibility. The entire world community has acknowledged that without Syria, which holds the key to peace, peace in the region stands no chance. It is now obvious that the idea of Rabin's maneuver is to disrupt the peace process. By instructing his chief delegate to the Washington talks to raise Israel's security concerns, Rabin sends the ominous message that his government is working to derail the upcoming talks and take things back to the point where they stood before the Geneva summit. Israel is known to resort to security pretexts every time the prospect that the peace process may move forward appears on the horizon. This, when it goes without saying that no security guarantees should have precedence over peace itself. Syria has stated, through President al-Asad, that it is willing to conclude peace and set up normal relations in the region. Indeed, Syria, also through President al-Asad, has made a strong appeal for peace and urged the Israeli leaders to display courage and cast off the practice of prevarication and procrastination. All of which raises legitimate questions about Israel's peace credentials and strengthens a conviction that Israel's claims are nothing more than a temporary tactic to absorb the ire of an international community annoyed by a ceaseless Jewish settlement activity in the occupied land. The Oslo agreement example only goes to prove our point. Israel is still blackmailing the Palestinians and out to play the Arab parties off one against another. Syria wants the kind of just, comprehensive, and dignifying peace on all the fronts that removes occupation and restores Arab rights. For Syria, there is nothing to choose between the Golan Heights and the West Bank, or any other occupied Arab territory, for that matter. Syria is not about to play Israel's games, nor will it give in to its blackmail. Against the background of the Geneva summit, Syria believes that the need has never been more pressing for the United Sates and the world community to get Israel to climb on the bandwagon of a fair and comprehensive peace.
