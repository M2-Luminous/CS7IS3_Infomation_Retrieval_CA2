The crystals were prepared from high-temperature aluminum solutions. A mixture of Al and the B-10 (99%) or B-11 (90%) enriched elemental boron powder was placed in an alumina crucible and heated under an argon atmosphere up to 1500�C, kept for 3 h, and then slowly cooled to room temperature. The crystals of (_a_-AlB[.sub]12[/](B-10) or (_a_-AlB[.sub]12[/](B-11) grown in the reaction mixture were separated by dissolving an excess of Al with hot hydrochloric acid. Well-formed single crystals with an approximately octahedral form bounded with [101] planes were used for the lattice constants and intensity measurements, which were made with a four-circle diffractometer equipped with Mo K[.sub]_a_/_a_1[/] radiation. Starting from published data,[.sup]1[/] the structure was refined with the aid of a full-matrix least squares program to the R(Rw) values of 0.028(0.035) and 0.025(0.033) for _a_-AlB[.sub]12[/](B-10) and a- AlB[.sub]12[/](B-11), respectively. The structural parameters (atomic coordinates, occupancies of Al sites, temperature factors) obtained for one crystal were the same as their respective equivalents for the other, demonstrating that the crystal structure including the nature of metal distribution is the same in both crystals. As shown in the following, however, there were appreciable differences in the lattice constants of the two crystals: (Enraf-Nonius CAD-4 four-circle diffractometer; MoK[.sub]_a_l[/], 0.70930 Angstrom, 20�C) _a_-AlB[.sub]10[/](B-10): a = 10.1570(4),c = 14.2622(7) Angstrom _a_-AlB[.sub]11[/](B-11): a = 10.1559(4),c = 14.2587(7) Angstrom reflecting the difference between the mass numbers of B-10 and B-11, which may affect the thermal vibration of boron atoms in a different degree and thus producing different B-B bond lengths of the icosahedral B[.sub]12[/] network in the two crystals. Structural details of the _a_-AlB[.sub]12[/] structure and metal distribution in it will be presented. References: 1. I. Higashi, T. Sakurai, and T. Atoda, J. SOLID STATE CHEM. No 20, 1977, p 67.
