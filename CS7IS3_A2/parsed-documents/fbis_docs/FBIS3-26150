First two paragraphs is LIAOWANG editor's note.] [Text] For many people, establishing and developing a capital market may be a strange concept, but it must be known and mastered under the conditions of the modern market economy. In order to enable our readers to understand the operation and development of this new thing. We invited Zhong Pengrong, who is reputed by overseas scholars as one of the "four dragons" among the contemporary mainland economists, to explain the general information about the capital market, and explain its functions, developmental conditions, and rules of operation. [Dong Ruisheng] Recently, the term "capital market" frequently appeared in the press, and many readers wrote letters to ask: What is a capital market? What differences are there between a capital market and a currency market? Could you please give us some information on this? [Zhong Pengrong] In simple words, a capital market is a market for long-term loans or securities. For example, there is the long-term loan market and the long-term bond market or stock market as well. The latter two are called securities markets, which constitute the main body of the capital market. The currency market is one for short-term working funds, such as the short-term loan market, the market for discounting commercial bills, and the inner-trade credit market [tong ye chai jie shi chang 0681 2814 2135 0234 1579 1034]. Normally, a short-term financial arrangement is one of less than a year; and a long-term arrangement lasts a year or more. The two types of markets are first of all different in the mobility and credibility of the tools of credit being issued and circulated. In the currency market, there are various types of short-term tools of credit, such as commerical bills and short-term government bonds. At the same time, because of the short terms of various types of financial arrangements, including short-term loans, they do not undertake almost any interest-rate risks. However, financial arrangments in the capital market will have to undertake much greater interest-rate risks. In particular, corporate shares will undergo more frequent price fluctuations. Another major difference between the two markets lies in their economic functions. The capital market mainly provides a mechanism for enterprises to raise their own funds and prepare long-term capital, and the funds raised through this market are mainly invested in fixed assets, thus forming enterprise capital. The currency market mainly helps enterprises adjust working funds, and the funds raised through this market are mainly used to make up for the short-term shortage of means of payment. [Dong] Being one of the markets for production factors, the capital market has been gradually developed in practice, although it was not explicitly mentioned in the past. As far as You know, at present, at what stage of development is the capital market in our country now? [Zhong] The main body of the capital market is the securities market. In my view, it should also include the market for property rights transfers, because property rights in a certain enterprise held in the form of shares and property rights bought directly from that enterprise are not different in essence. At present, the securities market in our country has basically taken shape. According to statistics, since the beginning of the pilot schemes for the adoption of the joint-stock system, nearly 4,000 enterprises have issued shares to raise funds in the process of reorganizing themselves according to the joint-stock system. At present, more than 150 enterprises have their A shares listed on the stock exchanges in Shenzhen and Shanghai, and their total market value has exceeded 350 billion yuan. There are more than 30 types of B shares worth totally more than 10 billion Hong Kong dollars. The total value of other securities also exceeds 100 billion yuan. Transactions on enterprise property rights have spread from Shenzhen to other parts of the country. Recently, China's first property rights exchange was set up in Shenyang. Generally speaking, however, development of the capital market still cannot satisfy the needs of the economic structural reforms, and still needs to be quickened. [Dong] In our country, where the market economy is still not developed enough, people have acquired more knowledge about the functions of the commodity market through reforms over the past 15 years, and commodity markets of all types have spread everywhere from cities to the countryside. This has given more convenience to the people in their daily lives, and has promoted economic development. However, in what way will the capital market play a positive and significant role in our country's economic structural reform and economic development? Would you please tell us your own opinion on this question? [Zhong] Generally, the development and improvement of the capital market will be conducive to the highly efficient utilization and reasonable movement of funds. In any specific capital market, investors (referring to legal persons and natural persons who possess idle funds) may decide the use of their money according to their own wishes. The nature of capital lies in proliferation, so the trade and enterprises which yield higher returns will naturally become the targets pursued by investors. In an economic society with fair competition, trades yielding high returns are normally trades whose development is urgently needed in socioeconomic life, and whose products or services are in short supply; enterprises yielding high returns are normally enteprises being properly managed and achieving good economic efficiency. If funds flow to such trades and enterprises, this signifies the reasonable distribution and utilization of social funds, and signifies that the limited funds are flowing through the market mechanism and the auction mechanism to enterprises of high efficiency and not the sort of enterprises which remain inefficient. [Dong] The shortage of funds is a main factor that hinders the development of developing countries. In our country, the existing scarce financial resources could not be properly used and distributed because of the drawbacks of the structure and were even wasted seriously. In view of this situation, the establishment and development of the capital market is of especially great significance for the current economic structural reform. [Zhong] The significance mainly finds expression in the following points: --The establishment of the capital market is the negation of the current funds distribution mechanism. At present, the distribution of investment funds in our country is mainly conducted in an egalitarian pattern of "cutting a cake." When the "cake" is being cut, consideration is given not only to the economic efficiency of various enterprises, but must also to various social, political, and personnel factors. As a result, enterprises achieving good economic results cannot obtain any funds or sufficient funds. With the establishment of the capital market, the distribution of funds will be regulated by the market mechanism, and the method of auction will be used. Thus, the distribution of funds will gradually be rationalized. --The establishment of the capital market represents the reform of the current investment system and is a fundamental measure for preventing ill-planned [mang mu 4159 4158] investment and reducing waste of investment funds. At present, funds for capital investment and new projects mainly come from bank loans, and banks are all run and owned by the state. This means that investment risks are all undertaken by the state. At the same time, as state banks bear investment risks, loan users do not need to exercise self-control when making investments, and they blindly start new projects in order to contend for a greater amount of loans from banks. This eventually causes serious losses. The basic purpose of establishing a capital market is to create a situation in which enterprises will not mainly rely on bank loans to achieve funds for their long-term investment projects, but will raise such funds from the capital market in the forms of bonds and stocks. When an investor buys the bonds or stocks of an enterprise or a project, he or she casts an affirmative vote for the project. The project can be started only if it achieves sufficient affirmative votes. This means the project will not be started until it passes the feasibility tests of thousands of would-be investors. Thus, the problem of blindly starting projects and causing losses to investment funds, which has existed for several decades, will be thoroughly resolved. --The establishment of the capital market will bring about profound changes to the enterprise system in our country. At present, idle social funds are mainly concentrated in the hands of state banks, and new enterprises are set up with loans offered by them. This may just lead to the establishment of state-owned enterprises. Enterprises founded with funds raised through the capital market will no longer be state-owned enterprises but joint- stock companies. Thus, such enterprises will have more flexible operation mechanisms as soon as they are founded. --Establishment of a capital market will promote reform of the banking system. Under the current banking system, banks are "eating from the same big pot." With the establishment of capital banks, the function of raising and distributing long-term investment funds will be shifted from state banks to the capital market. This will directly reduce the size of funds in the "big pot" and will also promote commercialization of funds. This is itself a major purpose of reform of the banking system. Another point should be made here. At present, in our country, the basic system of raising and distributing funds is: Individual residents (with idle funds)--state-owned banks--investment-makers. If there is anything wrong with an investment, the loan may not be retrieved. However, individual residents' deposits must be guaranteed and retrievable. So the state has to bear all the losses. In a perfect capital market, construction funds are raised by people launching a construction project directly from people who possess funds, and the investment risks are undertaken jointly by all parties who offer the funds. It should be stressed here that with the increasing financial capacity of banks and the increasing size of investments, if the current investment system is not thoroughly changed, the state will have to a bear heavier and heavier burden of investment risk. [Dong] I believe what you say will enable our readers to more deeply understand the role of the capital market. However, in the current circumstances of our country, what should we do in order to turn a theoretical concept into a reality and to more quickly establish and perfect the capital market? [Zhong] At the very least, we should make the following efforts: First, price controls should be lifted in order to really establish the market-determined price mechanism. A major characteristic of the capital market is that funds are no longer distributed according to government plan; instead, funds flow according to the profit principle toward economic sectors that may yield better returns. If price controls are not lifted, some economic sectors or trades (such as railways) will not be able to absorb funds, although their products or services remain in short supply; on the other hand, some economic sectors will continue to be attractive to investment funds because of attractive prices and the handsome profits they can make, although their products or services are not in short supply. If such situation continues for a long time, this will be extremely unfavorable to the rationalization of the property rights structure. In addition, the currently existing and still widening gaps between localities are extremely unfavorable to the reasonable distribution of funds. A major factor causing such gaps is the serious distortion of prices of elementary products and of manufactured and processed products. Under the present situation, in a richer area with a better investment environment, investment funds naturally yield better returns and such an area is naturally more attractive to funds. On the contrary, it is very difficult for a poor area to keep local funds, and it is even more difficult to absorb external funds. The widening gap between rich and poor areas is not the aim of our reform and opening. Therefore, when establishing and developing a capital market, we must adopt proper measures to reduce the misleading effects of the differences between localities on the movement of funds. While the local governments should make efforts to increase their local economic strength, the central government must also formulate corresponding policies and measures to help localities improve their investment environments and raise their capacity to attracting funds. Second, it is necessary to gradually perfect corresponding laws and regulations and strengthen management. At present, investors in our country do not have a keen sense of investment risks, and their investment knowledge remains limited. So their ability to make correct judgments is weak, and they are apt to be cheated. Over a long time in the past, when enterprises launched new projects, they had to submit plans to higher authorities for examination and approval. In recent years, when enterprises planned to adopt the joint-stock system and issue shares, they still had to submit their plans to the government departments in charge of examination and approval. So many investors feel that an investment in an enterprises is in essence an investment in the government. Therefore, laws and regulations must be perfected in order to prevent that some people practice fraud by taking advantage of investor ignorance. On the other hand, through more effective propaganda, investors should be helped to understand that the government is only responsible for managing enterprises and does not bear responsibility for financial losses incurred by investors so that they will increase the sense of risk and become more alert in making judgments. Third, interest rate controls should be lifted so that the movement of funds can be adjusted through market mechanisms. This is an important condition for the formation of a capital market, and is also a major characteristic of it. Only after interest rate controls are lifted will trades and enterprises of good economic efficiency be able to attract funds by offering higher prices. In a developing nation, in a certain sense, funds are scarcer than other resources. So more efficient and more economical use of funds is of great significance for the nation's economic development. The establishment and improvement of the capital market has proven a successful way to achieve this purpose.
