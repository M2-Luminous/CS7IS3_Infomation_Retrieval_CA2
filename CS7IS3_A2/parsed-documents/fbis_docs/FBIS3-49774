The BBC has already approached Polsat, the satellite television channel, with an offer to form a company in this regard. "Polsat holds a broadcasting license, and the BBC does not work with pirates," said BBC Polish section chief Eugeniusz Smolar, explaining this move. The agency's offices would be in Warsaw, and it would be financed by all of the television channels belonging to it. The agency would function as a joint-stock company, whose controlling shares would belong to the BBC. "Polsat would like to have most of the shares," Polsat chief Boguslaw Chrabota admitted. The BBC's idea is as follows. The new agency would produce and supply Polish private television channels with several news programs daily, plus footage on political, economic, social, and cultural events. In addition, the BBC is offering the Poles their own "BBC World Service" program, British television news footage, assistance in setting up NW-TV's Warsaw offices, and training for Polish reporters. Smolar warns, however, that these are only working proposals, and everything is yet to be decided between the BBC and the eventual partners. "We want to create a strong alternative to Polish television news," says Smolar. "The reason that British television is so good is that it has strong competition. In Great Britain, ITN [Independent Television News] competes with the BBC. ITN is a kind of news agency of the private television channels, which share a common information service." The commercial channels to whom the BBC offer is addressed have still not reached a decision. Miroslaw Chojecki of NTP Plus, which is seeking a license for nationwide Polish television, told us that "he does not know enough about this idea." But he realizes that it would be cheaper to use the NW-TV service than create one's own news agency. At Nicola Grauso's Polonia 1 channel, which is currently setting up a network of over a dozen local stations, we were told that each station must decide for itself whether it wants to cooperate with the BBC. The Warsaw-based NTW, which is part of Grauso's network, does not yet know whether it will buy the idea.
