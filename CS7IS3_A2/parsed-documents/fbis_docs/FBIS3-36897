It has become known, the document says, that during their latest advance on 7-8 February, the Gudauta separatists used 12 items of heavy machinery, howitzers, and Grad installations as a result of which six villages in Galskiy [Gali] Rayon were destroyed. More than 100 people were killed, and the homes of about 800 families was burned down. People were taken prisoner and seized as hostages. This action, the statement says, was carried out on the eve of the work in Moscow of a mixed group of experts on the status of Abkhazia and on the eve of the return of refugees and displaced people to Galskiy Rayon, envisaged by the results of the Geneva talks, and was planned with the clear aim of preventing the return of the refugees. These actions not only contradict the resolutions of the Security Council but also pursue the aim of hindering the process of normalization of Russian-Georgian relations. Expressing a resolute protest in connection with the crude violations of the Geneva accords, the Georgian Foreign Ministry calls on the United Nations, the CSCE, and the Russian Federation to activate all the mechanisms at their disposal to prevent any further escalation of the conflict, which threatens peace and stability throughout the Caucasus region.
