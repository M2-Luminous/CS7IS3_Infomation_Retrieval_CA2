The list took six months to compile, Baudys said. "A range of personnel measures are only now before us," he said, adding that 1994 would be the most significant year for the transformation of the armed forces. Units are finally being reorganized, at last creating "the right situation" for replacing some officers, he added. Baudys also said the army was prepared to launch a recruiting campaign in search of leaders at the company and platoon level for drilling soldiers and strengthening discipline, especially in the handling of weapons.
