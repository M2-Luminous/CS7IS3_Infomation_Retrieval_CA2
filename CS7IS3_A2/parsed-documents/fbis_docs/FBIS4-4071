Labour disputes have recently been more and more frequent in Huizhou with its rapid economic development. Violation of labour laws and regulations has been seen in foreign-funded and privately- owned enterprises including failure to apply for labour recruitment, disregard of labour contracts and infringement of workers' interests and rights. Statistics show that the city dealt with 346 labour disputes in 1993 alone, a more than 16 percent rise over the year before, involving 5,800 workers or an increase of over 100 percent. The city in response established a supervisory group last year to handle disputes. The group issued warnings and imposed punishments on enterprises found in breach of relevant regulations. It recovered for workers RMB 1.2 million, which included back pay as well as pay for sick leave, medical expenses and compensation for injuries at work totalling RMB 120,000, all of which should have been paid by the employers. Since the labour law and regulations are yet to be improved in addition to unsound supervisory bodies, the labour and management conflict was very complicated and labour disputes were frequent. The Huizhou Government made great efforts in launching a one-month campaign for a total overhaul of labour employment in the city in a bid to put in order relations between labour and management, protect the legitimate rights of workers and promote improvement of enterprises. The campaign covered a wide variety of enterprises with the emphasis on township enterprises, foreign-funded enterprises, privately-owned enterprises and construction enterprises.
