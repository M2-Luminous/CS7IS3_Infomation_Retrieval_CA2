Fujii, a member of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) in the governing coalition, was present at a general meeting of his supporters held February 20 at the U.S. base at Atsugi in the suburbs of Tokyo, the sources said. They said the use of a U.S. military base by ordinary Japanese citizens is banned in principle under the Status of Forces Agreement between Japan and the United States. Fujii told reporters he understood that the meeting was aimed at promoting friendship between U.S. forces and local residents, and therefore did not constitute a violation of the agreement. Foreign Ministry officials said they were not sure if the U.S. side regarded the meeting as part of political activities, but added that the ministry will ask the U.S. military to be careful about offering its facilities for use by Japanese citizens. The sources said about 300 members of the supporting group, including the mayor of Yamato, where the base is located, and members of the city's assembly, attended.
