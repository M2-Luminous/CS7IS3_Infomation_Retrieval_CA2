FR940627-0-00199 FR940627-0-00019 Table F 94&hyph;4._ Ethanol Base Fuel Properties 1␣ 1␣ E85: Chemical Grade EtOH, vol%, min 85 Gasoline Base Fuel, vol% 15 Chlorine (as chloride), wt%, max 0.0004 Copper, mg/L, max 0.07 Water, wt%, max 0.5 Sulfur, wt%, max 0.004 (f) Methane Base Fuel. (1) The methane base fuel is a gaseous motor vehicle fuel marketed commercially as compressed natural gas (CNG), whose primary constituent is methane. (2) The methane base fuel shall contain no elements other than carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. The fuel shall contain an odorant additive for leak detection purposes. The added odorant shall be used at a level such that, at ambient conditions, the fuel must have a distinctive odor potent enough for its presence to be detected down to a concentration in air of not over 1/5 (one-fifth) of the lower limit of flammability. After addition of the odorant, the methane base fuel shall contain no more than 16 ppm sulfur by volume. (3) The methane base fuel shall meet the specifications listed in Table F94&hyph;5.
