But the remarkable fact is that 20,000 have already returned. "Our native Russians" -- that was the term frequently used in our conversation by President Akayev when talking about the local Russian-speaking population, and it would seem that this is not a question of my interlocutor's eastern character. Akayev acknowledged that the opposition constantly accuses him of pro-Russian feelings. And this is not without reason. There are too many factors linking the Kirghiz president with Russia and Russian culture. His 17 years of life, study, and scientific work in Leningrad, and his family tree. It turns out that he is the direct descendant of the Kirghiz khan who sent the first Kirghiz envoys to Russia back in the 18th century. Another of Akayev's forebears took part with General Skobelev in the annexation of Kirghizia to Russia. Akayev tells of another curious and, to some extent, sensational fact from his family history. He is quite closely related to President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan. Askar Akayev's mother is a Kazakh. Once, when (briefly) head of the science department of the Kirghiz Communist Party Central Committee, he was in Alma-Ata [Almaty] for an interrepublic event. On that occasion a member of his family pointed to a man and said: That is Nazarbayev, our maternal second cousin.... Meanwhile, Akayev does not fear the charges of "pro-Russianism" because he is convinced that the interdependence of Kirghizia and Russia is an objective fact. Why? The problem of the ethnic Russians in Kirghizia is more acute than in other Central Asian republics because there are far more of them here -- almost a quarter of the population. In the main the Russian speakers are employed in industry, 90 percent of which consists of military-industrial complex enterprises. They constitute the most highly skilled workers and the intelligentsia -- in other words, a valuable pool of manpower which the republic could ill afford to lose. That is how things stand from Kirghizia's viewpoint. But Russia, too, must objectively have an interest in preserving the mighty Russian diaspora in our country, Akayev believes. For any country its diaspora in any other country is a factor of influence, a geopolitical factor. Akayev and his team are now completing work on a state program of measures aimed at retaining the Russian-speaking population in the country. This unprecedentedly large-scale action is already bearing its first fruit. Until quite recently, according to the opinion polls, the language problem was top of the list among the causes of distress to the nonindigenous population, but that problem has now slipped down to sixth place. This has happened, the president explained, because this problem was entirely within the bounds of our competence to resolve. But, unfortunately, not everything depends on us alone. That was why we needed major support from Russia -- and recently we got it. It proved possible not only to give Russian the status of the second state language, Akayev explained, but also to insist on the ratification in the Constitution of a standard forbidding any infringement of people's interests on the grounds of their lack of knowledge of the state language. A special law is now being prepared which will enable the law-enforcement organs to combat any discrimination in this regard. Akayev's main pride and joy is surely the Kirghiz-Russian Slav University, which is into its second year's work in the republic now, enjoys considerable popularity, and is being maintained on principles of parity. There are not only Slav students but Kirghiz, too. There are also students from neighboring republics. Incidentally, President Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan has already shown an interest in making the university interregional. This is of great significance for our native Russians, Akayev said. This has given them the confidence that their children can get a good education in their own language. But all of these things, let us recall, relate only to the Kirghiz side. Other factors -- economic ones -- have now risen to the top among the factors causing distress to the Russian-speaking population in Kirghizia. We have been forced to suspend production at the majority of enterprises, Askar Akayev stressed. Primarily because of a lack of orders and shortages of components. We are talking about enterprises in the military-industrial complex. Mainly purpose-built enterprises. For example, they produce submarines at a level which is unparalleled anywhere in the world. In addition, we also have a purpose-built test base at Issyk-Kul, a deep-water clear lake. There are unique electronics enterprises, too. I am convinced that closing them down would be a mistake. After all, there is a social problem here, too: That of Russian specialists left without work. That is why we put a suggestion to Russia -- let us share this problem equally and perhaps involve third countries. For example, we could issue shares in unique production units in such a way that Russia would have a large bloc of shares, perhaps the main bloc. There is another painful problem -- citizenship. I have always favored dual citizenship, Akayev said. But your relative Nazarbayev is a fundamental opponent of it, I pointed out, and you can see his point of view. In the event of the introduction of dual citizenship in Kazakhstan an enormous proportion of the ethnic Russians will become citizens of Russia and there is the potential danger of a territorial conflict. There is a great difference here, Akayev explained. We do not have a border with Russia and there can be no territorial problems here. Thus dual citizenship can only be a benefit for the Russian-speaking population in our country. The Uzbeks are a different matter, however. They live in the border region in our country and Kirghiz live in the border region of Uzbekistan, so in this case dual citizenship could play a negative role. Islam Karimov and I have agreed that for our countries the problem of dual citizenship is a closed question. In principle, I advocated and continue to advocate dual citizenship not as an abstract norm, but as a subject of interstate agreements. As for Russia and the Russian-speaking citizens, we should have no problems here.
