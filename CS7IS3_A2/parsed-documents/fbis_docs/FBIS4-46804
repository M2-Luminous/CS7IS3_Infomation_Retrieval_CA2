I refer to a demonstration organized by the republic Confederation of Trade Unions on Friday, which was conducted to the accompaniment of socioeconomic slogans. There are, truly, limits to society's patience and understanding of the severe conditions under which the republic finds itself. The government must clearly recognize that hungry people are extremely unreceptive to reforms and that the efficient reform of society is possible only under the conditions of the assurance of minimum conditions for society's subsistence. The demonstration also showed that the unions are not entirely happy with their present relationship with the government. The currency rates in the republic continue to be controlled with a "firm hand" by the Central Bank, and the prices of the basic consumer goods remain practically unchanged. A reduction in prices has been recorded even in respect to a number of commodity groups. True, the shortage of eggs had initially led to a doubling and tripling of their price: from 400 to 800-1,200 drams. But a carton of eggs now costs 600-650 drams. The price of cucumbers, tomatoes, and strawberries--all that has already ripened and produced its first harvest--is gradually acquiring a "human face." The situation in the energy sphere has remained practically unchanged (thank God!). The public is receiving its daily four-hour electricity "ration"--even more, should there be any surpluses. Certain hopes are being linked with Fourth Armenian Businessmen's Forum Conference, which is taking place at this time in Yerevan and in which entrepreneurs from many countries are participating. The minimum result of the forum will be, I believe, the creation in our republic of a new international bank and an open stock company--the Armenian Businessmen's Corporation. The final preparations for the start of privatization are being made. Last week the government confirmed the list of the first "small" facilities to be transferred to private ownership. In June, according to the president, the sales assistant will, finally, obtain his own set of scales, the tailor, a needle and scissors, and so forth. Privatization certificates--vouchers that should clearly identify each citizen of the republic's share of the former general property--will, finally, arrive in the republic this same month, the Ministry of Finance promises.
