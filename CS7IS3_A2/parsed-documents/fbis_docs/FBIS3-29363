The announcement will be made around the time an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection team arrives in North Korea, according to the official. But the announcement will carry conditions -- that North Korea allow unrestricted IAEA inspections as agreed this week, and that Seoul and Pyongyang reopen dialogue, he said. Unification-related ministers met Thursday morning and discussed necessary action following the North Korea-IAEA agreement on nuclear inspections. Pyongyang is demanding that Seoul and Washington suspend Team Spirit and schedule the next North Korea-U.S. high-level talks simultaneously with the arrival of the IAEA inspection team, the ministry official said. This would constitute the "small package deal" between Pyongyang and Washington. North Korea has yet to notify the IAEA of the entry date and schedule for the inspection team, but Seoul expects the IAEA delegation to arrive in Pyongyang late this week and begin work next week. Inter-Korean dialogue is likely to resume next week as well, the official predicted. The resumption would be in the form of previous working-level contacts for the exchange of presidential envoys. He said the announcement on Team Spirit and North Korea-U.S. high-level talks would come around that time. "But it will be a conditional announcement," said the official. North Korea would have to meet the necessary prerequisites in order for the high-level contact to take place and for Team Spirit to be canceled. Speculation has it that the date of the high-level contact would be sometime in mid-March, since the IAEA inspection team needs two to three weeks in North Korea and another few weeks to file a report.
