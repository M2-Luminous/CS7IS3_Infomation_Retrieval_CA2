FR940720-1-00026 FR940720-1-00007 (4) The individual will access only the VBA automated claims records of VA claimants who are represented by the person obtaining access or by the organization employing the person obtaining access; (5) The individual will access a claimant's automated claims record solely for the purpose of representing that claimant in a claim for benefits administered by VA. (6) Upon receipt of the password, the individual will destroy the hard copy; no written or printed record containing the password will be retained; and (7) The individual and organization will comply with all security requirements VBA deems necessary to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the data and VBA's automated computer systems. (b) An organization granted access shall ensure that all employees provided access in accordance with these regulations will receive regular, adequate training on proper security, including the items listed in §14.643(a). Where an individual such as an attorney or registered agent is granted access, he or she will regularly review the security requirements for the system as set forth in these regulations and in any additional materials provided by VBA. (c) VBA may, at any time without notice: (1) Inspect the computer hardware and software utilized to obtain access and their location; (2) Review the security practices and training of any individual or organization granted access under these regulations; and (3) Monitor an individual's or organization's access activities. By applying for, and exercising, the access privileges under §§14.640 through 14.643, the applicant expressly consents to VBA monitoring the access activities of the applicant at any time. §14.643 Disqualification. (a) The Regional Office Director or the Regional Office Director's designee may revoke an individual's or an organization's access privileges to a particular claimant's records because the individual or organization no longer represents the claimant, and, therefore, the beneficiary's consent is no longer in effect. The individual or organization is no longer entitled to access as a matter of law under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. §552a, and 38 U.S.C. §§5701 and 7332. Under these circumstances, the individual or organization is not entitled to any hearing or to present any evidence in opposition to the revocation. (b) An individual or organization granted access privileges to VBA automated claims benefits systems may have such access privileges revoked either to an individual claimant's records or to all claimants' records if the individual or organization: (1) Violates any of the provisions of §§14.640 through 14.643; (2) Accesses or attempts to access data for a purpose other than representation of an individual veteran; (3) Accesses or attempts to access data other than the data specified in these regulations; (4) Accesses or attempts to access data on a VA beneficiary who is not represented either by the individual who obtains access or by the organization employing the individual who obtains access; (5) Utilizes unapproved computer hardware or software to obtain or attempt to obtain access to VBA computer systems; (6) Modifies or attempts to modify data in the VBA computer systems. (c) If VBA is considering revoking an individual's access, and that individual works for an organization, the Regional Office of jurisdiction will notify the organization of the pendency of the action. (d) After an individual's access privileges are revoked, if the conduct which resulted in revocation was such that it merits reporting to an appropriate governmental licensing organization such as a State bar, the VBA Regional Office of jurisdiction will immediately inform the licensing organization in writing of the fact that the individual's access privileges were revoked and the reasons why. (e) The VBA Regional Office of jurisdiction may temporarily suspend access privileges prior to any determination on the merits of the proposed revocation where the Regional Office Director or the Director's designee determines that such immediate suspension is necessary in order to protect the integrity of the system or confidentiality of the data in the system from a reasonably foreseeable compromise. However, in such case, the Regional Office shall offer the individual or organization an opportunity to respond to the charges immediately after the temporary suspension.
