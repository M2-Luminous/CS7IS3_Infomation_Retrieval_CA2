FBIS3-57720 "drsov019_b_94001" FBIS-SOV-94-019 Document Type:Daily Report 29 Jan 1994 RUSSIA NATIONAL AFFAIRS Political Issues Government Cuts Russian TV Funding by Half LD2701224994 Moscow Russian Television Network in Russian 2020 GMT 27 Jan 94 LD2701224994 Moscow Russian Television Network Language: Russian Article Type:BFN [From the "Vesti" newscast] [Text] The media and the authorities should have one another's best interests at heart, if both of them are Russian. But the journalist proposes, while someone else disposes. [Milyanchikov] It looks as though Russia's leaders remember Russian Television only on days that are critical either to the country or to themselves personally. At such times, a live relay from a rally can be organized, a necessary program can be broadcast, and people can even work nights. But, during the rest of the time, the Russian TV and Radio Company -- set up, I remind you, at the instigation of Boris Yeltsin for the fight against Gorbachev -- turns out to be superfluous. Today, at any rate, at a meeting of the company's leaders at the Finance Ministry, it became clear that Russian TV is only hindering the government. It asks for money. But there is no money for it. The state company, which is totally dependent on the state, will only be given half of the money needed, and most of that will go on paying the communications engineers. This means that the amount of broadcasting will have to be almost halved. Many programs will disappear -- "K2", "Program A", "The Best NBA Games", the Disney cartoons, "Santa Barbara", and the Monday thrillers. The company no longer has any money with which to buy them. Thousands of people who trusted Boris Yeltsin in 1990 and who left the then rich Ostankino for the disordered life of Russian TV will be dismissed. Today, in the office of General Director Anatoliy Lysenko, arguments have already been heard about what is to be cut and by how much. [video shows meeting in progress, unidentified man speaking]. [Unidentified speaker] I see this simply as the death of the channel. Well, we are now trying to find something, but, in general, the president's decree talked about reduction -- and it has to be viewed as a kind of therapy, the shedding of a small amount of broadcasting -- but today we can already see that it is not therapy. It is surgery. It is amputation. It is the amputation of state television. [Milyanchikov] A similar fate awaits Radio Rossii.
