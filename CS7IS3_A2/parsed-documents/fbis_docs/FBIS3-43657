That, says State President F.W. de Klerk and ANC [African National Congress] leader Nelson Mandela, is the success recipe other political leaders should use to make free and fair elections possible in South Africa. Agreements or proposals during today's crucial meeting were not, however, released to the media. Mr. De Klerk and Mr. Mandela confirmed that a comprehensive anti-violence plan containing ANC proposals and government initiatives would be drawn up. [Begin recording] [Reporter Gary Alfonso] After four hours of critical talks at the Union Buildings in Pretoria, Mr. de Klerk and Mr. Mandela emerged to say, against media expectation, that the government and the ANC had formulated a joint plan to curb violence. Although both leaders agreed not to release sensitive details to the media, they again condemned recent senseless attacks such as the Katlehong shooting. They, however, confirmed that future efforts to end the carnage in troubled areas would have to be facilitated through strong community-based projects. [De Klerk] A very strong action, coupled also with solution- orientated and community-orientated actions will be necessary and we will be focusing, in the days to come, very strongly -- now having had also the important input from the ANC's side. Secondly, we discussed the constitutional situation and the need for further interaction with the Freedom Alliance. We are thinking inclusively. We want the significant parties within the Freedom Alliance to become part of the process. [Mandela] The progress that we have made today is a very encouraging one. That crisis will emerge if Mr. de Klerk remains deaf to the proposals that I am making, but from what has happened today it does appear that we are making very good progress. [Alfonso] Referring to the breakdown in talks with right-wing negotiators, Mr. Mandela remained firm on the impossibility of a volkstaat [homeland] for Afrikaners, but said he hoped the right- wing would prefer dialogue to civil war. [Mandela] I urged Ferdie Hartzenberg yesterday that he must heed -- and his colleagues -- must refrain from inciting that section of the Afrikaners who want a separate homeland -- that they must avoid the situation where that section is going to be isolated and become the target for the anger of the majority of the people of South Africa, black and white. [Alfonso] Mr. de Klerk confirmed that the government had proof that extreme right-wing elements had been involved in various incidents of township violence. [De Klerk] From time to time right-wing people are directly involved in specific incidents and evidence has been uncovered and, therefore, we must assume that there are elements in their ranks who are involved in violent actions [Alfonso] Both leaders have agreed to meet again next week to discuss and finalize the joint strategy against violence and other constitutional issues.
