Skaarup: "Folketing Demands Removal of Secrecy Surrounding Police Intelligence Work"] [Text] Five years after the end of the Cold War, the Folketing is demanding greater openness in the PET [Police Intelligence Service]. The service's surveillance of extreme political activities among the population and search for spies and terrorists is to be brought into the light of day. The inspiration for this lies in our neighboring countries, including the German Intelligence Service, which openly speaks about its work. The special parliamentary control committee of five members is currently exploring how much access the public can demand without its jeopardizing the effectiveness of the PET's investigations, according to committee Chairman Svend Erik Hovmand (V [Liberal Party]). The blanket of secrecy is today so thick that the public is allowed to know nothing of the budget, methods of investigation, or files on suspects. Even the control committee -- with all the parliamentary committees under the strictest pledge of secrecy -- has access only to the broad, general guidelines for PET's work. Svend Erik Hovmand is assured of a majority for the idea. Two other committee members, Ole Espersen (SDP [Social Democratic Party]) and Jens Thoft (SF [Socialist People's Party]) have already expressed agreement. "There is no reason whatsoever why the guidelines for PET's work, for example, should be kept from the public. In my opinion, around 10 out of almost 1,000 pages received by the control committee since it was set up in 1988 ought to be kept secret. As for the rest, if they were left scattered about the streets it would not matter," Jens Thoft said. He has been jealously observing the open-door policy practiced by the German Intelligence Service. A quarterly account is published with information on the current threat situation and on the groups currently under surveillance. "In a democratic country it is both reasonable and important that the citizens know as much as possible about the public institutions. That must also apply to the Police Intelligence Service," Svend Erik Hovmand said. The head of PET, Chief Commissioner Birgitte Stampe, is no stranger to the idea. She has revealed that she is in the process of writing a folder on the PET similar to those already issued by the British MI5 and the Norwegian Surveillance Police. If Justice Minister Erling Olsen (SDP) is able to support the idea, the folder will be available later in the year at public libraries.
