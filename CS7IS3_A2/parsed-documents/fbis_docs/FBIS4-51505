But the position of the Japan Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] to which you belong seems to be different. What is your party's position? [Kand a] In northeast Asia, there is a military threat against Japan. But we should neither unnecessarily strengthen our defense capability nor seek disarmament. I do not think immediate disarmament is necessary because Japan is faced with a difficult defense situation. [YOMIURI] There is a view calling for the exercise of the "right of collective self-defense" in the face of the issue of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons. What is your view? [Kanda] I am rather a dove in the DSP. I want to respect the spirit of the Constitution. At the same time, however, I have to think of the situation surrounding Japan. [YOMIURI] Do you mean the government's interpretation of the collective self-defense right--which the government has said it is constitutionally impossible to exercise--will change depending on the situation? [Kanda] I think (if the situation surrounding Japan changes) various opinions will emerge on security and therefore the government's position on ways to ensure security might possibly change. [YOMIURI] How do you respond to the U.S.-proposed Theater Missile Defense (TMD) plan? [Kanda] Although I want to positively consider the possible participation in the plan, this project will cost a huge amount of money. We have to give careful consideration to the plan with possible efficiency of the plan in mind. [YOMIURI] What is your view of Japan's participation in the UN Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) and the UN Peacekeeping Force (PKF)? [Kanda] We want to positively take part in the PKO. As for the PKF, we have to consider the possibility of joining the PKF in the future, but it has many problems. Therefore, a careful study should be made of the possibility of taking part in the PKF.
