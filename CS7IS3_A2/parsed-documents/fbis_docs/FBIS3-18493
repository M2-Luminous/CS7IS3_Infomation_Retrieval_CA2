The Federal Association of German Wholesale and Foreign Trade (BGA) expects new jobs and lower prices from the enlargement of the European Union. The accession of the three countries will provide new impulses to the German export economy, BGA Executive Director Peter Spary said. "We are now even bigger than the North American free trade zone NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement]," Spary said on Saarland radio. The German consumers can also be happy about the enlargement: "Competition in wholesale and foreign trade will reduce prices even further." The Federal Association of German Industry [BDI] in Cologne stated that the Germany industry was relieved that the membership negotiations with Sweden, Finland, and Austria were concluded on time and is hoping that agreement with Norway will follow in a few days. For the German industry, the enlargement of the European Union by EFTA [European Free Trade Association] countries has always been at the top of its European objectives list. "The intensive trade and investment relations with this area speak for enlargement as do the democratic and liberal traditions of these countries." The industry is hoping that with their accession, the advocates of a cosmopolitan policy and a policy of the market economy by the European Union will receive further support.
