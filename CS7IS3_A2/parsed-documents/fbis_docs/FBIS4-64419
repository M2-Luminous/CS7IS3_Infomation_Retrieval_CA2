Stressing that the statement represented the joint voice of jurisprudence in the country, Yusuf Kenan Dogan, under secretary of the Ministry of Justice, said: "All the enemies of the nation, be they fundamentalists or separatists, must heed that voice." The statement, which was signed by all the Republic's prosecutors and chief prosecutors, was disclosed by Ertem Turker, chief prosecutor of Mugla. It included the following: "The Republic's chief prosecutors and prosecutors have very carefully assessed the recent irresponsible activities that are aimed at changing the secular form of our state and basing it on fundamentalist principles. Legal measures will definitely be taken against those activities. The Turkish people must have confidence in the Republic's prosecutors in that regard. Secularism is one of the state's inalienable and undeniable principle that cannot be ignored. Consequently, any concession on that principle will be tantamount to renouncing democracy and the republic. Therefore, vigilance must be maintained against the antisecular inclinations and activities more than ever before. The Republic's prosecutors have expressed their resolute will to continue to support and protect the secular system." Demiral Warns Politicians Nusret Demiral, chief prosecutor of the State Security Court in Ankara, has assessed the joint statement. He warned the politicians to adopt a cautious approach. Stressing that the statement was crystal clear, Demiral said: "Our politicians and all the officials must realize the meaning of the views we have expressed to avoid pushing the state toward an unfavorable direction or representing it in a negative way. We shall take action against them if they ignore that. We can take action against anyone, including Prosperity Party Leader Necmettin Erbakan. We have taken action against many officials in the past." Ahmet Koksal, chief prosecutor of the State Security Court in Istanbul, expressed his views: "The meaning of that statement is exactly what you understand from it. Our message is quite clear. Those who fail to comply will definitely be confronted with the sanctions that are called for by the laws. As in the case of all the other forces, the Republic's prosecutors and judicial officials maintain a steadfast stance on the question of protecting democracy and the free system. No one must worry in that regard." Nazmi Sarvan, chief prosecutor of Ankara, described the statement as a "memorandum." He said: "The reaction in the community reached a peak in the summit. The joint statement we have issued is the expression of the final form of that reaction. The statement is the joint voice of the secular republic's jurisprudence. I am convinced that it is an effective lesson and warning to those who are opposed to secularism. They may draw conclusions from the joint statement if they wish."
