The calm and peaceful inhabitants of Aden were taken by surprise by these four missiles, at a time when the adventurist gang in Sanaa is shouting about its wish to bring about a solution by way of a cease-fire. This shows not only the insincerity of this bloody gang, but also once again confirms its insistence on persevering with the destructive war against our people in the DRY and with the lack of care for the innocent victims and other civil losses resulting from this war. The responsible source in the DRY Armed Forces Command confirmed that our ground defenses succeeded in shooting down one of the missiles, while another fell into the sea without causing any material damage (?or) [word indistinct].
