Is there a threat to social peace? [Lafontaine] When it is a question of social peace, nobody should play with fire. Therefore, reason is required from all sides -- from both employers and trade unions -- in the collective negotiations. Everyone knows that a compromise must be finally achieved. Therefore, I am appealing to both sides of industry: Return to the negotiating table. Move your positions closer to one other and achieve a reasonable compromise! [Koch] The employers are calling for wage cuts. Will we reduce unemployment in this way? [Lafontaine] No. General wage cuts and zero-wage rounds do not fit into the economic landscape: They would further weaken private consumption and increase unemployment even more. After the increase in rates and taxes in the past few years, the breaking-point has been exceeded for the majority of employees. Rents are increasing. Some families hardly know any longer how they are to pay for their children's school outings. General wage cuts and zero-wage rounds cannot be socially justified either. They would result in pension cuts for the first time in 1995. [Koch] The trade unions are calling for shorter working hours and the employers want us to work longer hours again.... [Lafontaine] There are 4 million people registered as unemployed in Germany. Therefore, it is precisely now that we need collective bargaining policies that are oriented to employment. This includes a fairer distribution of work and incomes. In the Volkswagen company, both sides of industry showed how jobs can be secured and mass dismissals be prevented by new ways. Finally, the Federal Government also wants more part-time work. Some years ago, Kohl still rejected it by calling it "stupid, absurd, and silly."
