After the much-publicized controversies that emerged within the ASI [Italian Space Agency] on the scientific value and costs of the mission (also involving former ASI Scientific Committee Chairman Prof. Remo Ruffini and the Board of Directors at that time chaired by Prof. Luciano Guerriero), Minister Colombo had foreseen the possibility of freezing the SAX program, assigned by the ASI to Alenia Spazio. In an interview given to a Milanese daily newspaper last summer, Colombo declared: "I have found there is extreme interest in the project. We must consider the 320 billion lire already spent and decide whether to conclude rapidly to guarantee the effectiveness of the research to be performed for a further five to six years, or whether it would be advisable to stop now. However there are international commitments which must not be forgotten." The SAX program, costing a total of approximately 700 billion lire (including 418 billion lire for building the satellite), also includes the scientific and industrial participation of the Netherlands through the NIVR (Dutch Institute for Aircraft Development and Aeronautics). The structural and thermal mockup of the satellite is currently undergoing vibration, thermal vacuum, and sound tests at the European Space Agency (ESA) ESTEC [European Space Research and Technology Center] in Noordwijk (the Netherlands), while the engineering model is being subjected to a series of tests at the Alenia Spazio plant in Turin. "Up to 90 percent of the contract has already been spent on building the satellite," say the Italian engineers, "and all the hardware is now ready. The assembly of the satellite flight units will start in early 1994. We are making normal progress and our view is that the project is gaining increasing scientific importance." According to recent forecasts -- and if Minister Colombo does not decide otherwise at the last minute -- the SAX satellite should be launched into orbit at the end of 1995 by an American launcher, Atlas. The current plans of the ASI foresee the building of an earth station in Singapore for receiving astronomical data collected by SAX and for retransmission to Italy.
