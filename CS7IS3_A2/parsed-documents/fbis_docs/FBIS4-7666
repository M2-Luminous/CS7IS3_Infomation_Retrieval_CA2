The list is headed by party chairman Zoltan Kiraly, followed by academician Laszlo Kapolyi, third is MSZDP Secretary General Istvan Podkoniczky. It was reported that the MSZDP was able to put up territorial lists in 11 counties by Saturday, and 46 of the 170 candidates have already collected more than the necessary 750 recommendation slips. In answer to a question, Kiraly said that even if the party does not attain the 5 per cent limit needed to enter parliament, he is confident that an MSZDP group can be created with 10 individual MPs.
