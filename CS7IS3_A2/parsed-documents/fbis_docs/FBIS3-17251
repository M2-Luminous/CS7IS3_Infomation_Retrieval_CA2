The procedure for effecting transition to this system is prescribed in Decree of the Russian Federation Government No. 935, dated 22 September 1993. A week ago, kray Governor Yevgeniy Nazdratenko adapted the government's decision to Maritime Kray, signing a decree with a similar title--"On the Transition to the New System of Payment for Housing and Public Utilities and on the Procedure for Affording Citizens Compensation (Grants) in Effecting Payment for Housing and Public Utilities." In accordance with these documents, by 1998 an apartment owner will pay 100 percent of the expenses for residential upkeep and repair (except capital repair), as well as for public utilities. Each year, beginning this year, the proportion of money paid by citizens to compensate for these expenses will be increased by 20 percent. The social housing norm has been established in the kray at 20 meters per individual, and maximum norms for public utility consumption (for example, 120 kilowatt-hours per family member per month) became effective 1 March, within the framework of which rents must not exceed 10 percent of a family's aggregate income. The state is providing compensation and grants for this purpose. Housing grant departments must be established in administrations at all levels prior to 1 April. Beginning 1 March, the proprietors of residences of all forms of ownership, including dormitories, will pay 20 percent of the prime cost of housing and public utilities. According to Mikhail Savchenko, chairman of the kray administration Committee on Housing and Municipal Services, the average three-person family in Vladivostok will pay 19,200 rubles [R] per month over the course of this year for an average (two-room) apartment. In general, citizens' expenses for the use of living quarters will increase 17-fold.
