[Ocalan] As an important tactical objective, it is possible to move the guerrillas into Turkey's rural areas. This could lead to important results. Also, operations in Turkey's urban areas could be developed enormously. Operations carried out specifically against tourism and economic targets in cities will further erode the economy. In particular, by rendering tourism wholly inoperative, the financial resources of the special war could be totally dried up. If its financial source is eradicated in this manner, then it will be highly difficult to support the army. [passage omitted] Looking at our history, we can genuinely see that we have reached a stage where we have been getting the best results and asserting our military strength. The military method, which has exhausted itself for the state, has potential for us. Not only could they not inflict military defeat, elimination, breaking of hands, legs, and heads, we are actually living through a process whereby we are able to firmly stand on our feet and make our body and backbone unbreakable. [Gul] Could we speak of the possibility of a cease-fire, or are there any signs of a political solution on the horizon? [Ocalan] It is our existing policy to seek a political solution. The false political solution plan on which they have been working has come to light. It was published in the press too. They have fallen into the pitiable situation of expecting help from the village guards, burned-out Kurdish collaborationists, and some of our critics. [passage omitted]
