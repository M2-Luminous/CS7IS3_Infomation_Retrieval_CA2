The SCP, formed in July 1990, "has in practice outgrown and superceded by far its original organizational frameworks, and its internal structure restricts its functioning." The statement gives several reasons for the abolition of the SCP. First, all fighters for the freedom of the Serb nation are nowadays calling themselves Serb Chetniks, regardless of whether or not they are members of the SRS. Second, it is stressed that the nature of the Chetnik movement is deeply patriotic and freedom-loving, and that now that the movement has been established it should not be reduced to party, ideological, and political frameworks. The Chetnik movement is fully established today because it is generally accepted in all Serb countries, and in the imperilled Serb countries powerful Serb armies have been formed whose unity in leadership must not be challenged, the statement says. One of the reasons for abolishing the movement is that the enemies of the Serb nation are trying to take advantage of the formal establishment of the SCP to present it as proof that paramilitary formations are active in Serb countries, although Chetnik volunteers act only under the command of the Serbian Army. The duplicating of work by the committees of the SRS and SCP has occasionally caused misunderstandings, the statement says, and adds as the final reason that members of other political parties have joined the SCP. The same decision by the Central Homeland Administration advises all SCP committees in all Serb countries to integrate with SRS committees.
