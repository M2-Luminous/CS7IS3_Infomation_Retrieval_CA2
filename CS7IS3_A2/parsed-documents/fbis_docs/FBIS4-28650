Kakizawa is expected to use his talks Saturday with South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and South Korean President Kim Yong- sam to reconfirm a determination among Japan, South Korea and the United States to get tough on Pyongyang and prepare punitive action against its secretive nuclear program. South Korea may brief Kakizawa on Kim's visit to Russia and Uzbekistan and Han's visit to New York and Beijing, Japanese Foreign Ministry officials predicted. In Beijing on Sunday, Kakizawa will ask Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen for China's support for a resolution by the UN Security Council against Pyongyang, Foreign Ministry officials said. China has repeatedly expressed hope that the North Korean nuclear crisis could be resolved through negotiations. Japanese, South Korean and U.S. officials are counting on the powerful UN panel to move on the resolution as early as next week. Kakizawa and his South Korean and Chinese counterparts will also take up other issues, including the summit of the Group of Seven (G- 7) economic powers in Naples, Italy in July.
