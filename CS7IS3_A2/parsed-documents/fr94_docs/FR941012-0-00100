FR941012-0-00100 FR941012-0-00011 Paragraph (d)(2)(iii) requires a health care provider to review and approve annually the first-aid kits the employer provides, both as to the adequacy of the kit's contents and the number of kits provided. OSHA has added this requirement in the final rule for several reasons. First, 1910.151(b) already requires that first-aid kits be approved by consulting physicians. OSHA is aware that health care providers in addition to physicians are qualified to approve first-aid kits and OSHA wants to provide flexibility for employers in meeting this requirement. Second, 1910.151(b) only requires initial approval of first-aid kits rather than periodic approval. However, OSHA believes that a periodic review of first-aid kits is necessary and appropriate in the logging industry. This industry is one in which the workplace is often not near medical personnel, infirmaries, clinics, or hospitals that are best able to treat logging injuries. Therefore, it is important for a health care provider to assess the contents of first-aid kits to see that they contain those supplies that will provide effective assistance for an injured worker. Once the kits are reviewed and approved, paragraph (d)(2)(iv) requires the employer to maintain the first-aid kits in accordance with the approval conditions. Employers have the duty to ensure that first-aid kits are adequately supplied and replenished as necessary. In addition, the employer is responsible for assuring that kit contents are usable, that is, there is no spoilage or damage due to weather conditions. For example, employers need to periodically check first-aid supplies to ensure that materials are still in clean and sterile condition. Seat Belts At paragraph (d)(3) of the final standard, OSHA is requiring the provision of seat belts for the operator of any vehicle or any machine equipped with ROPS or FOPS and the use of seat belts by the vehicle and machine operator and passengers. The pulpwood logging standard required the provision of seat belts on mobile equipment, but did not require the use of seat belts by operators and passengers. The proposed rule required both the provision and use of seat belts by tractor, equipment and personnel transport operators. In addition, the proposed rule allowed an exception to using seat belts when the employer had ``reasonable cause to believe that safety of the operator is jeopardized by wearing a seat belt.'' The 1978 ANSI logging standard required logging machines to be equipped with seat belts. All State logging standards also require the use of seat belts by operators and passengers of machines and vehicles. OSHA received many comments on the use of seat belts (Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;45, 5&hyph;51, 5&hyph;54, Tr. W1 79, 113, 183, 213). The West Virginia Forestry Association recommended expanding the seat belt requirement to require seat belts be installed and used in all personnel transport vehicles because West Virginia did not have a state seat belt law (Ex. 5&hyph;4). Other commenters also recommended that OSHA not permit any exceptions to the use of seat belts (Ex. 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;27, Tr. W1 183, 213). One commenter reasoned that any exception would invite widespread abuse and seriously weaken OSHA's field enforcement capability (Ex. 5&hyph;22). However, other commenters said that seat belts should not be required because they would unduly restrict operators, would result in greater injury if an object entered the operator area (i.e., ``jillpoke''), and would be hazardous for employees operating machines on steep terrain (Ex. 5&hyph;35, 5&hyph;45; Tr. W1 79, 113, OR 31&hyph;2, 83, 120, 181). After reviewing the comments in the record and the available accident data, OSHA has decided in the final rule to eliminate the seat belt exception for several reasons. First, the record shows that use of seat belts would save lives in the logging industry (Ex. 4&hyph;129). A State of Washington study also reported 12 loggers killed in rollover accidents from 1977&hyph;83 (Ex. 4&hyph;129). All 12 of those employees were crushed by the machine when they were thrown from the cab. This study concluded that all of those deaths might have been prevented if the employees involved had been wearing seat belts because the ROPS and FOPS were still intact when the machine came to a rest. This study also concluded that eliminating exemptions on seat belt use would save lives in the logging industry.
