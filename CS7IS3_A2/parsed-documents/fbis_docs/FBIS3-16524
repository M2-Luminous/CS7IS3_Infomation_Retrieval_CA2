There is effectively no legitimite rule in the town, says a cable from the deputy head of administration of the town, received by ITAR-TASS. The Vladivostok mayor's office is blockaded by OMON [Special Purpose Militia Detachment] men who have been brought in by Lebedinets, vice governor of Maritime Kray. They are not allowing lawyer Ulitskiy to see the mayor, although Mayor Viktor Cherepkov has been detained, a report from the mayor's office of the town points out. The fact that yesterday the mayor had a serious heart attack is being ignored, and doctors who arrived in an ambulance have told him to stay in bed and have forbidden him being questioned.
