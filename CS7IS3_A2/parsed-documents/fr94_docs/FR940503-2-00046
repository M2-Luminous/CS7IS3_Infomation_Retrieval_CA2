Metropolitan Edison Company [Docket No. ER94&hyph;1167&hyph;000] Take notice that on April 19, 1994, Metropolitan Edison Company (Met-Ed) tendered for filing pursuant to Rule 205 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.205) amendments to its existing rate schedule, for borderline service to Pike County Light & Power Company (Pike). Under such existing rate schedule, Met-Ed has been providing borderline service to Pike. By an Order issued July 30, 1993 in Commission Docket No. PL93&hyph;2&hyph;002, the Commission held that, in recognition of the character of the borderline service provided, the Commission had adopted as the wholesale rate the neighboring utility's retail rate, provided that the utility documents the state commission's approval of the retail rate. Under the tendered amendments, Met-Ed would (1) terminate its Borderline Service Agreement, dated July 22, 1980, with Pike, and (2) file as its Borderline Rate Schedule for borderline service to Pike the Met-Ed retail Rate Schedule that is currently on file with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PaPUC) which was approved by the PaPUC.
