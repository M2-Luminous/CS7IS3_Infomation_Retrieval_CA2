Comrade Dao Duy Tung, member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the party Central Committee, is attending. Comrade Pham Van Tho, member of the party Central Commmittee and secretary of the provincial party committee, delivered a report to the conference. According to the report, after scoring outstanding achievements and effecting a considerably high economic growth rate over the past three years, Hai Hung is now adopting new measures to shift to the commodity economy and effect economic restructuring in the direction of the market mechanism. The average gross domestic product for the last three-year period increased by 7.85 per cent, which is 2.3 times higher than that of the previous five-year period. The 1993 grain output reached 1,252,000 tons and the local industrial output accounted for 29.2 per cent of the overall national industrial product. The average export index reached 9 million dollars. The report of the provincial party organization's executive committee also pointed out Hai Hung's shortcomings as follows: The local economy still depends entirely on agriculture and is unstable. The pace of development of the commodity economy is slow. Production operations are scattered. Agricultural products processing and consumption is still rife with many difficulties. Unemployment constitutes a burning problem. Hai Hung is making efforts to ensure that from now until the conference of the seventh provincial party organization it will achieve an average increase of more than 9 percent in the gross domestic product; formulate an overall economic development plan under which agriculture will account for 40 percent of overall production, industry for 30 percent, and the service sector for 30 percent; apply uniform measures to boost the multisectorial economic growth; make continued efforts to renovate and perfect the mechanism and economic management system, create a favorable environment for the development of the commodity economy, resolve social problems, renovate and revamp party organizations, and strengthen the relations between the party and people.
