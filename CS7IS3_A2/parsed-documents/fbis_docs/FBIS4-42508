While local organizations have been established in six laender, the party's national board refused to recognize Brandenburg and Saarland groups, and establishment of a Berlin organization was deferred. The HANDELSBLATT article noted that the party's constituent congress in North Rhine-Westphalia made an "awkward impression." During the session, party founder Markus Wegner and national chairman Bernd Schuenemann attacked one another on the stage. In the heated debate, Schuenemann, a professor of criminal law and the philosophy of law in Munich who was elected in March, called Wegner a member of a "cadre party." In the ensuing raucous scene, they even came to blows. The 19 May FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE reported that six members of the national board relieved Schuenemann of his office on 17 May, citing the serious damage he had done the party, his intentional violation of party regulations, and his failure to observe conventions of democracy. The article speculated that a similar party fate awaits the Thuringian party chairman, von Bogendorff, and that the Bavarian party organization finances are to be examined for irregularities. The rancor of the rivals seems exacerbated by the party's seeming lack of a platform, though in 1993 it did present a statement of principles, which was cited in the HANDELSBLATT article: "The demands were above all: not to spend more than was collected, to meet costs through higher efficiency, to examine government operations with an eye to privatization consistent with social policy, to postpone and extend payment schedules for planned investments." The article further noted the party's economic policy of promoting small- and medium-sized businesses and of technology to create and preserve jobs and to offset the risky economic status of Hamburg's port. These views, peculiar to the party's caucus in the Hamburg senate, are less clear among more recently formed party groups such as those in Schleswig-Holstein, Hesse, and Baden-Wuerttemberg, which do not hold legislative office. The article asserted: "The newcomers' program is vague, if existent at all: liberal, conservative, and `grass-roots democratic' positions alternate; market economy tendencies on the one hand and ecologically oriented demands on the other only rarely seem attuned to one another." The next nationwide meeting of the Statt Party organization is scheduled for 4 June in Hamburg. It will tackle the question of how many legitimate local party organizations there are, how many authorized board members there may be, how much the party may have been strengthened by a shrinking core membership, "and perhaps, how many genuine Statt parties really exist." A 9 May FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE article questioned whether so late a meeting can restore the party's potential for conducting an effective campaign for the European Parliament election on 12 June, or whether that possibility was shattered by the debacle in North Rhine-Westphalia. Opposition to Maastricht Shakey Another recently founded party, the Union of Free Citizens [BFB], is also among the 23 parties authorized to post candidates for the European Parliament election. Barely five months old, the party is also drawing up a platform for the federal elections in October, with special emphasis on economic and financial policy. In contrast to the Statt Party, however, as noted in the 13-14 May HANDELSBLATT, "the membership rolls in the laender organizations usually carry only a few names..." and the BFB's geographic distribution makes it "a predominantly southern German phenomenon," whereas the Statt Party membership is primarily in the north. The BFB, however, numbers only about 420 members, according to an article in the 20 May FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, and according to public opinion polling institutes, support for the "liberal-conservative reform party" is currently so slight that it cannot be measured. Personal clashes within the BFB are impeding its expansion, as with the Statt Party, and some founding members take exception to recent political maneuvers by the party chairman, Manfred Brunner. Brunner has developed contacts with the Bavarian Christian Social Union [CSU], a party rather to the right of the liberal founders of the BFB, and has associated with Joerg Haider, the chairman of Austria's Liberal Party [FP0e], who is generally conceded to be on the extreme right of the political spectrum. According to the FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, the BFB's "Guidelines for European Policy" seem less pro-German than anti-European Union [EU]: the party is in favor of preserving the German mark as currency, rather than falling victim to the "Esperanto money," as the Munich CSU chairman, Peter Gauweiler called the ECU. The party "also intends to guard against `the regulatory mania' of the EU; the joint agricultural policy ought to yield to simultaneous supports dictated by operations, and in questions of environmental protection, the EU ought to confine itself to what is absolutely essential." Whether the party properly describes itself as the "champion of German interests," by virtue of its concept of a European policy at odds with the Maastricht Treaty, or whether it is viewed as a nationalist group moving ever further to the right, even the chairman's old friends and supporters are leaving the party and questioning his judgment.
