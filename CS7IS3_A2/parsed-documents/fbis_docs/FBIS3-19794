FBIS3-19794 "drweu056__a94008" FBIS-WEU-94-056-A Document Type:Daily Report 23 March 1994 ANNEX Inter-European Affairs EU Fails To Support Belgian Position on Nuclear Fuel BR2203154994 Brussels EIS Database in English 1 Mar 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY BR2203154994 Brussels EIS Database Language: English Article Type:BFN [Unattributed article: "Nuclear Research: Future of European Research Reactors Fails To Impress"; from Brussels EUROPE ENVIRONMENT] [Text] Belgian attempts to guarantee a future for its experimental nuclear reactor at Mol by making the European Union [EU] responsible for its survival appear to have been scuppered, at least for the moment. The draft Council Resolution on the subject submitted to the Council of Ministers' Research/Atomic Questions Group during the Belgian Presidency has been struck off the agenda of the March 4 Research Council after the United Kingdom, Germany and Ireland insisted this was a problem for the individual reactor operators to handle, not the EU. The draft Resolution would need unanimous Council support to be adopted. The proposed text arguably seeks to kill at least two birds with one stone. Belgium has never been happy about the perceived unfair competition from the EU-funded Joint Research Centre experimental reactor in Petten, the Netherlands, whose costs -- decommissioning for example -- are calculated on a somewhat different basis from those of Mol. The proposal argues that the viability of test reactors (and EU research reactors in general) depends on finding a long-term solution for the problem of initial fuel supply and final waste disposal. Some observers suggest that turning fuel supply into a Union responsibility could be seen as an attempt by Belgium to encourage the EU to allow Russia to sell its cheap nuclear fuel on the EU market. Belgium, with its large nuclear industry but no domestic nuclear fuel production, would be the obvious beneficiary. The Commission is currently negotiating a new Euratom Agreement on behalf of the EU with the United States on nuclear materials trade and services amid an international tussle over whether the United States should take back the spent enriched uranium it has been supplying to research reactors in Belgium, Austria, Denmark, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. The main problem area of the Euratom Agreement negotiations concerns the U.S. demand that it should be able to monitor the movements of nuclear material of U.S. origin within the EU -- a proposals which the EU adamantly refuses to countenance. The proposed text for the Resolution nevertheless includes a clause stating that the Commission should highlight the importance of finding a solution for disposing of radioactive waste from European experimental reactors in its negotiations with Washington. EU Energy Commissioner Abel Matutes is expected to take up the issue of consent rights with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher at a meeting in March.
