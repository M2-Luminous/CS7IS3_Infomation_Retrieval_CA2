FR940208-0-00109 FR940208-0-00031 Service Response: The critical habitat designation includes the southern 2 mile-strip of Ft. Irwin, which is south of where most existing military operations have already degraded or eliminated desert tortoise habitat. Joshua Tree National Monument, the DTNA, and the Desert National Wildlife Range were not included in the designation of critical habitat because the designation would not afford these areas any additional benefit. The mandates of the Service and the National Park Service provide for ecosystem management, and those of the BLM are for multiple use of public lands. The DTNA is managed specifically for the benefit of the desert tortoise as both a research natural area and an Area of Critical Environmental Concern. The specified areas are considered important for recovery of the desert tortoise in the Draft Recovery Plan and will be considered in establishing desert wildlife management areas. If, in the future, mineral extraction or other actions that may adversely affect critical habitat are proposed to be allowed within these areas, the Service may reevaluate whether additional critical habitat should be designated. Issue 8: Several people were concerned that critical habitat would restrict access to their private lands or mining operations. Service Response: The Service anticipates being able to work with other Federal agencies to minimize effects on private landowners. Section 7 consultation requirements on Federal rights-of-way applications may, in some limited cases, result in additional mitigation requirements or modified access to private lands, but the Service cannot quantify the economic effects. Issue 9: A few letters stated that the critical habitat designation should include the Pahrump/Amargosa Valley. Service Response: The Service based its critical habitat proposal on those areas recommended for recovery in the Draft Recovery Plan. The Pahrump/Amargosa Valley was not one of those areas, and, therefore, it was not included in the proposed designation. Issue 10: A few respondents requested inclusion of additional areas as critical habitat for the desert tortoise. One letter suggested that inclusion of previously disturbed areas will provide buffer zones while recovery of the habitat occurs, thereby minimizing edge effects of incompatible land uses and providing smooth-edged boundaries that are preferable in minimizing the boundary-to-area ratio. Service Response: The Administrative Procedure Act requires Federal agencies to provide appropriate notification of proposed actions prior to making final determinations. Therefore, the Service cannot adopt a final rule that is significantly different from the proposed rule without first offering the public an opportunity to comment on the differences. Departmental policy is to waive notice and public comment only in special cases such as emergencies or instances where a proposed amendment makes only minor technical changes in a rule. The only addition to critical habitat in the final rule for desert tortoise critical habitat was the inclusion of 3 square miles of BLM land on the southern boundary of the Beaver Dam Slope CHU in Arizona. This request for inclusion came from the BLM, as the landowner, to ensure that its desert tortoise study plot was within desert tortoise critical habitat. No other landowners will be affected by this inclusion. Other requests for inclusions were considered significant and were not requested by the landowner. In order to meet the court-mandated schedule for designation of critical habitat, the Service was not able to prepare a second proposal including any of these areas for public review. Such inclusions may be considered during any future reevaluation of the designated critical habitat boundaries. Issue 11: The BIA opposes designation of any critical habitat on any tribal lands. The critical habitat proposal included lands within Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah-Shivwits Band (Paiute-Shivwits) lands. The BIA maintains that formal consultation under the section 7 jeopardy standard of the Act provides adequate protection for the desert tortoise.
