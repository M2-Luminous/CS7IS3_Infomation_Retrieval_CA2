The chief of the Swiss Military Department thinks that security policy openness is essential. In his opinion, the discussion of the future of national defense has to continue, but now the implementation of "Army 95" is in the foreground. On Saturday a surprisingly large number of politicians, federal and canton parliamentarians, and government and Zurich city councillors gathered in the Zurich congress house, where the KOG general meeting took place. The focus of the event was the definition of security and defense policy positions by Federal Councillor Kaspar Villiger. In the introduction of his lecture entitled, "Topical Security Policy Questions," Villiger gave a general outline of the world political situation. It is now clearly proven that the Report 90 is a useful basis for Switzerland's security policy. There are no longer any islands of total security; Switzerland will also have to live in a gray area between peace and war, he said. Afterward, the chief of the Swiss Military Department reported on the diverse efforts to establish security structures, particularly in Europe. In his opinion, a small state like Switzerland with a limited security policy scope has every interest in the establishment of such systems, for neutrality has largely lost its importance as a security strategy. In his representations, Villiger followed the line of the neutrality report in the addendum to the recently published foreign policy report. The principle that Switzerland still does not interfere in foreign controversies is still extant. It lends particular credibility to the Red Cross and later perhaps to Swiss blue helmets as well. Neutrality must not be abandoned, but adjusted to the changed general conditions. According to Villiger, neutrality that is understood in a modern way provides scope for security policy opening. In his view, security policy cooperation is indispensable. Establishing relations with NATO -- the federal councillor mentioned the invitation to Partnership for Peace -- and the Western European Union (WEU) is possible, but membership is not conceivable for reasons of neutrality, he said. In view of the numerous unsolved conflicts and the absence of a solid European security system, it is necessary for Switzerland to continue to maintain an adequate defense capability. Villiger briefly dealt with the new defense doctrine, which is formulated in the "Operative Command 95" regulations. It translates the security policy strategy into military practice, and is now to be tested in exercises. In addition, the Army has to adjust its mission to the new spectrum of risks and to extend it. With a view to defense against forms of violence below the threshold of war, it is useful to employ troops to support civilian governments in extraordinary situations. Those who claim -- Villiger referred here to the "security policy" working group's report -- the Army wants additional tasks in order to legitimize itself anew do not take into account security policy realities. Villiger got to talking about military peace operations that represent means to prevent crises and crisis management. Participation in UN operations with blue helmets is of solid military use for Switzerland; blue helmets would convey experiences of war that one would otherwise not have. Villiger knows that many officers are skeptical of such a commitment. This is not an existential question; the credibility of Switzerland's security policy is at issue, he said. Therefore, he appealed to the present cadres to consider this matter thoroughly and to deal constructively with the blue helmet file. At the same time, however, he intimated that a political opinion is not forced on anybody. In Austria, Finland, and Sweden, one is proud of being able to provide blue helmets. Villiger substantiated the "multiple functions" of "Army 95," which concerns the Army as a whole and not individual units. Of course, in the medical service, for example, it is possible to rely more on civilian structures and facilities. It is useful to use military means and military knowledge for disaster relief, however, even if some people do not understand this. The militia system is by no means outdated either. It is true that only professional armed forces can by used as intervention forces in international operations. However, Switzerland does not want to participate in them. Moreover, a professional army is out of the question for Switzerland for political and financial reasons. As for the rest, Villiger pointed out that armed forces assigned for defensive fighting are based on draftees or militia structures. Increasing interest in the Swiss militia system can even be internationally determined, he said. The militia's power of cohesion must not be underestimated. "Army 95" has to be translated into reality now. The solution that has been found will be reexamined according to the development of the world political situation or because of changes in general internal conditions. The question of strength will certainly be put on the list again, since studies show that it will no longer be possible to ensure a control strength as of 2005. Villiger did not conceal that the project would be fundamentally affected in the event of further budget cuts and thus seriously endangered. Even though the implementation of reforms is in the foreground, the discussion on future development has to continue. Innovative ideas are always welcome, he said. In the business segment of the event, KOG President Guenter Heuberger, major in the General Staff, reported on the importance of the officers' societies for Switzerland's military policy and also called on the officers present to deal objectively with the question of blue helmets. Heuberger will be replaced according to routine rotation by Peter Fischer, captain in the General Staff.
