FR940805-0-00026 FR940805-0-00009 The commenter contended that the purpose of the Congress was ``to reduce the burden on displaced aliens in the visa application process'' and quoted from the House Report statement reproduced above in support of this contention. The commenter omitted the last two sentences of the paragraph and appears to have misunderstood the point being made. In reality, the Committee was acting to preserve the status quo insofar as the filing of immigrant visa applications was concerned. As is clear from the discussion above, the ultimate outcome was to preserve the status quo, but to make explicit the Secretary's authority to determine by regulations the place of immigrant visa application by codifying it in the first sentence of section 222(a) of the Act. Thus, there is clear connection between the regulations implementing the Immigration Act of 1924 and those implementing the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended. Moreover, it is clear that the basis of the regulations simply has not been that asserted by the commenter. The commenter sees the regulations governing place of application as intended to benefit alien visa applicants. Quite to the contrary, while the Department has attempted to give aliens broad notice of the procedures that will generally apply in ``ordinary circumstances,'' it is clear that the regulations have always been intended for the benefit of the Government, giving it the flexibility to decide where immigrant visa applications will be processed. This flexibility has traditionally been important for two significant reasons. First, there has always been a profound concern that an alien not avoid meaningful examination of his or her admissibility by having the visa application processed by a consular office in an area remote from his or her country of residence. Insofar as the constraints in the resources of a particular consular office render knowledgeable assessment of the application more difficult, the workload management issues discussed below are also relevant here. Second, the Department has always had major concerns about the management of the consular function. There has never been a time when the Department has not had constraints on its resources. Consular staffing has been subject to those constraints as has every other aspect of the Department's operations. For that reason, it has always been of great importance to the Department both to have the authority to apportion available resources in a manner responsive to the level of demand for services and to have a basis for predicting levels of demand. The ability to specify where intending immigrants will be authorized to apply for an immigrant visa is crucial from both points of view. In addition, it is noteworthy that the Department frequently has to adjust its handling of the visa workload because of world events. The statutory scheme, by leaving the place of application to be determined under Departmental regulations, allows this flexibility. The commenter also expressed concern about the fact that the current regulation allows for the processing of an application by a consular office in an area where the alien is physically present but has no residence if the alien ``expects'' to remain in the area throughout the necessary processing time while the proposed regulation would require the alien to establish his or her ability to remain there for that time. The commenter sees that change as being of major significance. The Department believes that this concern ignores reality and that the change in wording merely reflects that reality. A consular officer will not ordinarily accept an alien's assertion that he or she expects to remain in the area for the requisite period of time without a basis for believing the assertion to be true. Thus, the consular officer will ordinarily inquire further into the matter if the alien merely makes the bald assertion with no explanation for its basis. Moreover, it is the Department's position that a consular officer may properly decline to accept the application for processing if it reasonably appears that the alien's asserted expectation is unrealistic or otherwise ill-founded. In light of the foregoing, the Department believes that the proposed change in wording does not have the significance the commenter apparently has ascribed to it. The commenter asserts that incorporation into the proposed regulation of the phrase ``Unless otherwise directed by the Department'' has the effect of rendering the regulation meaningless. The Department strongly disagrees. As pointed out in the commentary accompanying the proposed rule, the Department's position is that it has always had the authority reflected in this phrase and that this proposal does nothing more than make explicit what has always been implicit. Moreover, this comment presumes that the Department has in the past made, or intends in the future to make, frivolous use of this authority. The Department can find nothing objectionable in the establishment of a general rule, which will apply and guide consular officers in all normal circumstances, but which may be modified by the Department as necessary in those situations in which operational or policy considerations require it. Finally, the commenter has asserted that the first and second sentences of the proposed regulation have the effect of requiring that an alien permitted to apply at the consular office in the area in which he or she is physically present also apply at the consular office in the area of the alien's residence. The Department wishes to ensure the commenter that it had no intention of producing such a state of affairs.
