By a vote of 244-178, the House urged President Bill Clinton to end the ban and allow arms flow to the Bosnian Muslims, who were seen as the "grieved side" in the Balkan war. Although against the U.N.-authorized arms ban, the Clinton administration maintains that unilateral end of the embargo would undermine other U.S. foreign policy goals. The Senate adopted a similar measure earlier as an amendment to the fiscal 1995 bill. For the two amendments to have legal binding effects, the House and Senate will have to negotiate further. And President Bill Clinton could also veto the measure, which can only be rejected by a two-third vote in Congress. The Clinton administration tried in vain to avert Thursday's [9 June] vote by sending Defense Secretary William Perry, Under Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili to the capitol. In a joint statement to the House, the three warned that "unilateral U.S. actions will fracture the NATO alliance and put us at odds with Russia." For his part, Clinton wrote to Representative Lee Hamilton that "U.S. action to lift the embargo would bring the peace process to an end, destroying the unified approach we, our allies and the Russians have been working to achieve." Thursday's vote had been planned earlier but was postponed at the request of the administration to avoid embarrassing Clinton while attending the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the D-Day.
