UN military observers (UNMOs) had reported a critical food situation in some 50 villages in the Kakanj region, where the civilian population faced starvation, said UN Protection Force spokesman Major Idesbald van Biesebroeck. "UNMOs haven't seen anybody who died of starvation yet but it will not take long any more before that will happen," he said. "In the village of Ricica, some children are close to starvation," he added. Croat and Serb forces were largely to blame for delays to aid supplies, he said. But he also hit out at the local councils' food distribution policies, notably in Kakanj, where priority was given to soldiers, families of soldiers killed in combat, wounded soldiers and local politicians, with the most deprived people helped last. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees civil affairs spokesman, Larry Hollingworth, confirmed the report: "Without a shadow of doubt the situation is desperate." In December the UNHCR was able to deliver only 17.9 percent of the region's food requirements, he said. Hollingworth said he had no direct proof aid was being confiscated by troops from all three armies, but added: "(With) no other aid coming (in) and soldiers looking healthy, what can one conclude?" In Sarajevo, an artillery battle and ground fighting erupted as the Moslem-dominated Bosnian army and Serb units resumed their struggle for the Serb-held Grbavica district. Government forces recently won territory in Grbavica from the Serbs holding the area located along the Miljacka river, a foreign military expert said. Two civilians were decapitated by shell fragments in separate incidents and two other people, including a Bosnian soldier, were killed in the fighting, said doctors at the city's two functioning hospitals. Some 42 people were reported wounded, including a two-month old baby. [passage omitted] Sarajevo airport reopened briefly early Thursday but was closed again almost immediately due to the fighting and no flights were able to land. Aid flights were suspended late Wednesday after a rocket hit the runway. [passage omitted] Foreign ministers from the Organisation of the Islamic Conference are to meet Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic in Geneva on January 17, the eve of the resumption of peace talks on Bosnia, blocked over Moslem demands for more land.
