FR940303-0-00032 FR940303-0-00011 Background On December 29, 1992, the IRS published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register (57 FR 61852) proposing amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. These amendments provide guidance on several requirements of the low-income housing tax credit and incorporate and expand upon the guidance provided by Notices 89&hyph;1 and 89&hyph;6. Written comments responding to the notice of proposed rulemaking were received. A public hearing was scheduled for February 16, 1993, pursuant to a notice of public hearing published simultaneously with the notice of proposed rulemaking. However, the IRS received no requests to speak at the public hearing by the designated date. On February 8, 1993, the IRS published a notice (58 FR 7497) cancelling the public hearing on the proposed regulations. After consideration of the comments received, the proposed regulations are adopted as revised by this Treasury decision. Explanation of Provisions Carryover Allocations Section 42 provides for a low-income housing credit that may be claimed as part of the general business credit under section 38. In general, the credit is allowable only to the extent that the owner of a qualified low-income building receives a housing credit allocation from a State or local housing credit agency (Agency). Under section 42(h)(1)(E), an allocation may be made to a qualified building that has not yet been placed in service, provided the building is placed in service not later than the close of the second calendar year following the calendar year of the allocation (a carryover allocation). Section 42(h)(1)(E)(ii) defines a qualified building as any building that is part of a project if the taxpayer's basis in the project (as of the close of the calendar year of the allocation) is more than 10 percent of the taxpayer's reasonably expected basis in the project (as of the close of the second calendar year following the calendar year of the allocation). For these purposes, the taxpayer's basis equals the taxpayer's basis in land and depreciable property. See 2 H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 1104, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. II&hyph;82 (1988), 1988&hyph;3 C.B. 572. A carryover allocation may also be made to a multiple-building project under section 42(h)(1)(F). Commentators requested clarification on when a carryover allocation is treated as if it had never been made. The final regulations clarify that only a failure to satisfy a requirement of section 42(h)(1) (E) or (F) that must be satisfied by the close of the calendar year of allocation will cause a carryover allocation to be treated as if it had not been made.
