FBIS4-5860 "dreas073__a94002" FBIS-EAS-94-073-A Daily Report 15 April 1994 ANNEX Japan Relationship Changing Between Companies, Banks Relationship Changing Between Companies, Banks 942A0082A Tokyo NIKKEI KINYU SHIMBUN in Japanese 21-25 Feb, 1 Mar 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0082A Tokyo NIKKEI KINYU SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Article in seven parts by the Corporate Finance Reporting Team] [21 Feb p 1] [Text] (1) Handling Bad Debts, Banks' Priority The relationship between corporations and banks and securities companies is worsening. Reciprocal holding of stocks practiced by corporations and banks, which used to symbolize the close relationship between the two, has begun to fail due to the prolonged stagnation of the stock market, as well as low rate of corporate profit growth. Leading corporations are hurrying to separate themselves from banks. This is especially apparent in their overseas operations, where they are trying to find a way to raise funds by themselves. Will the intensified competition caused by banks branching out into the securities business bring profit to corporations? We will examine the relationship between corporations and banks and securities firms, which is definitely changing at this unstable time after the collapse of the "bubble economy." (Corporate Finance Reporting Team) Testimony 1. "One lower rank city bank told us that they wanted to sell the reciprocally held stocks. We agreed and both of us sold a part of our holdings in the market." (Itochu Corp.) Testimony 2. "Sometimes banks sound us out on selling our stocks. It seems some banks are selling their reciprocally held stocks without even asking corporations." (Hitachi Ltd.) Testimony 3. "We have sold out a part of our reciprocally held stocks which two of the city banks had held." (Sankyo Corp.) Banks are rushing to sell reciprocally held stocks of corporations. "Now, it has become easier to sell stocks." One financial director of a major steel company expressed his relief this way. It was evident that the March 1994 period would show a heavy deficit. They were preparing to sell stocks in order to balance accounts. They were wondering how to approach the bank whose stocks they were planning to sell. Just then, The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, The Nippon Credit Bank, and some trust banks came to them to ask about selling their reciprocally held stocks of the steel company. How timely! "Since banks are selling our stocks, we can sell theirs, too." They found a perfect excuse. Corporations, too, have reasons to want to sell banks' stocks which they reciprocally hold. Leading corporations in steel and automobile industries are plagued with poor business results, and rushing to sell their assets. The main sale items are stocks, mainly bank stocks which do not produce cash flow, except for a little dividend. According to Daiwa Research Institute's estimate, the latent profit of security holdings of the corporations listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange was 40 trillion yen. Of this, 23 trillion yen, which is about 60 percent of the total latent profit, was from bank stocks. Bank stocks are great items to sell to produce profits. Considering efficiency of assets, it is better to sell them off, rather than buy them back. Nihon Paper Manufacturing Co., the largest in the paper and pulp industry, was established by the merger between Jujo Paper Mfg. Co. and Sanyo Kokusaku Pulp Co. last spring. They began to negotiate with 20 percent of their creditor financial institutions with the intention to cut them off within a year. Naturally, they will discuss cancellation of the reciprocally held stocks. Before the merger, Jujo had 44 creditor companies, including life insurance companies. Sanyo Kokusaku had 28. After the merger, they still had over 50 creditor companies. "When you have so many creditors, the business process gets complicated. Also, fund-raising becomes less flexible" (a director of Nihon Paper Mfg. Co.). This is the reason for being selective in deciding which financial institutions to keep. Restructuring of corporations (business restructuring), including mergers, is promoting cancellation of banks' stocks they hold reciprocally. Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals has also begun to limit the number of financial institutions it transacts with. The company has selected about 10 city banks and regional banks to which it had relatively small debt out of 41 banks it dealt with. Within two to three years, it is planning to cut ties to the rest of the banks as it finishes paying off its debts. "We have had a long-term relationship with these banks, and we reciprocally hold stocks with them, also" (Tetsu Nakayama, managing director). However, concerning the banks it is cutting off, it is planning to sell their reciprocally held stocks. It is prepared for the time when the banks will sell its company's stocks. The warrant bonds (a debenture with preemptive rights) are also affected by the stagnant stock prices, and the rights are not being exercised. It is ironic that we do not have to worry about stabilization of stock prices anymore. Reciprocal holding of stocks by corporations and banks is closely related to loan situations. We have results of research done by Nissei Kiso Research Institute on major city banks and The Industrial Bank of Japan. This study shows the relation between the lending ratio of major city banks and the Industrial Bank against total corporate borrowing, and the banks' stock holdings. When a bank holds stocks of a loan customer, the lending ratio is 13-17 percent. When they do not hold stocks, the ratio is only 3-4 percent. While some companies are cutting down the number of correspondent banks, some companies are trying to reinforce their relationship with certain banks. Fuji Bank, which is the main bank for Unidax, an electronics parts sales company, bought about 100,000 more shares of Unidax stocks last fall. Fuji Banks' shares of Unidax stocks doubled. Unidax is also planning to increase its shareholdings of Fuji Bank. Unidax has already had some directors transferred from Fuji Bank. Its loan from Fuji Bank has increased, also. It is trying to strengthen the relationship with the bank. Life Corporation, a bulk dealer of foods, is reinforcing its ties to Mitsubishi Corp., and at the same time it is starting business transactions with Mitsubishi Bank. Many of the leading corporations are diversifying fund-raising methods, and lowering its dependence on bank loans. The necessity for corporations to reciprocally hold banks' stocks is decreasing, from the fund-raising point of view, also. However, corporations cannot cut off ties with all banks. Corporations are beginning to select banks. [21 Feb 94 p 1] [Text] (1) Reciprocal Holding of Stocks Is Relaxing, and Cost Awareness Is Up Reciprocal holding of stocks between corporations and financial institutions progressed in the late 1980's, when stock prices were high. Both corporations and financial institutions rapidly increased equity financing (fund-raising with issuance of new stocks) in order to raise funds with low interest. For smooth promotion of equity financing, it was considered effective to keep stock prices the same by holding stocks reciprocally. The basis of reciprocal holding of stocks was established "during the post war period up to 1960" (Nissei Kiso Research Institute). Reciprocal holding of stocks during this period was supposed to "stabilize the management of corporations" (Nissei Kiso Research Institute). Reciprocal holding of stocks during period of high stock prices is different in nature, since its goal is to raise funds. Another way to raise funds for corporations, which is more effective than equity financing, is to use internal reserves [hold internal profits by not selling stocks]. When the number of issued stocks increases through equity financing, the burden of dividend payments also becomes heavy. With internal reserves, there is no such problem. Even though the dividend is kept low in order to increase the internal reserve, there will not be much criticism if reciprocal holding of stocks is widely practiced. Reciprocal holding was thus useful in this sense, also. There is some cost involved in internal reserves. When stock prices were increasing and the investment profit rate was kept high, the cost was not much of a burden. Not to mention that internal reserves were believed to generate latent profit. When stock prices stopped increasing, the cost of internal reserves began to be reviewed again. Shosuke Ide, director of research at Nomura Management School, pointed out, "if you perceive stocks as profit bonds rather than control bonds, the reciprocal holding system will have to fail." Nomura Research Institute conducted a study on the corporations listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. According to this study, the reciprocal holding rate of financial (institutions') stocks was 41.0 percent as of the end of March 1993. This was lower than a year before by 0.8 percent, the largest drop among all the industries. The trend to cancel reciprocal holdings by corporations and financial institutions was already evident then. "In the United States, maintenance of assets which do not generate cash flow has been avoided as much as possible, because it was considered to be a factor for lowering profitability. In Japan, cash flow has not been regarded as important" (Daiwa Research Institute). Corporations and banks have been accepting the situation where they held "assets that did not generate cash flow" (stocks jointly held). This type of relationship is becoming very difficult to keep any more (Toru Hasegawa of the Tokyo Securities Division.). [22 Feb 94 p 1] [Text] (2) Unreliable Main Banks Koyo Machine Industries, a manufacturer of construction machinery and listed on the Osaka Securities Exchange, requested the Osaka district court to apply the Stock Company Reorganization and Rehabilitation Act to them. "Banks were very nice to us in this matter. We owe them a lot." Akinori Fujitani, president of Koyo, stressed that they had a strong relationship with banks. However, contrary to what Koyo expected, the banks had already begun to consider stopping their support to the company in the beginning of fall. It was about a year ago when Koyo's fund situation worsened. It was having difficulty recovering the large investment it made for golf course development. To add to this, the number of orders decreased due to the recession. Its main bank, The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, supplied a loan of several billion yen for operational funds and gave Koyo advice on restructuring. Last fall, when Koyo Machine Industries asked The Long-Term Credit Bank to send them some personnel, its request was denied. At that time, Koyo believed that "the bank must have considered this matter positively. Probably they will send us some personnel in spring" (manager at Koyo). Koyo was still hopeful. The Long-Term Credit Bank felt that "Koyo does not seem to have made any particular effort on its part, and there is not much hope for reconstruction." It avoided supporting Koyo by sending its personnel there. The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan stopped any additional loan to Koyo in late December, and at the same time it sent a representative to Koyo in Osaka to inform it of the following. "If you are going to legally seek reorganization, we will support you as much as we can." A few days later, Koyo Machine Industries applied for application of the Stock Company Reorganization and Rehabilitation Act. According to its certified public accountant, its total debt was as much as 72 billion yen. One of the management people at The Long-Term Credit Bank confessed, saying, "I am just speaking generally. Times have changed. The economy does not expand anymore like it used to if banks worked diligently and got a shot in the arm once in a while. We must consider more seriously than before how much support to give so that our loss will not become too much." It has been an important role of main banks to support and lead reorganization of companies that are going down. This function as the "lender of last resort for companies" is disappearing. Where do banks draw the line? They have begun to seriously consider the following three points. First, the owner of the corporation may keep management information to themselves and may not provide it to the bank. Therefore, it has become more important to have a good understanding of the management situation because the breakdown of the "land myth" caused real estate-secured loans to become less practical. Second, the type of industry has poor growth possibility. Therefore, in a mature economy, the business is not expected to revive by just existing. Third, supporting one company indefinitely may cause banks to be criticized by society. Therefore, while efficiency of banks' assets is being questioned, supporting a business, which may take a long time to rebuild, may cause stockholders and depositors to distrust banks. In Koyo Machine Industries' case, the problem has been caused by a combination of its excess investment during the bubble economy and its poor business results. The second point is true in this case. "This would not have happened, if we had kept our ties with banks stronger," a sales manager of Kikko, an Osaka wholesaler of confectionery, is more critical of its former management than the banks which forsook it. When it was having a difficult time raising funds, there was no evidence that its banks, such as Fuji Bank, aggressively supported them. This manager was told by the bank's branch manager, who was soon to be transferred, "our business is to loan money. If we could, we would. However, because we will not know where the loaned money will go, we cannot do anything about it." After this incident this manager was informed that management "lacked sincerity in dealing with its banks." The first point applies here. However unreasonable it may be, what if the banks continued to support the company? A manager at The Long-Term Credit Bank points out that "a lawsuit by the stockholders awaits the bank." This is the third point. The lawsuit filed against Mitsui Trust and Banking Co. by Azabu Building Co., which drew attention as a question of "lender's responsibility," caused banks to be hesitant about getting deeply involved with corporations. Of course, there still are cases where a bank saves a corporation in crisis, and the relationship between the two is strengthened. Last December, when Isetan's stocks were bought up by a real estate company, Shuwa Corp., the Mitsubishi group bought back 58.8 million shares that Shuwa held. Thus Isetan's crisis was resolved. At the press conference, Isetan's president, Kazumasa Koshiba praised Mitsubishi Bank, saying that "it (Mitsubishi Bank) fulfilled perfectly its role as our main bank." However, Mitsubishi did not support Isetan unconditionally. Isetan's former president, Kuniyasu Kosuga, was rumored to have had disagreements with Mitsubishi Bank. His resignation last May preceded the bank's decision to help Isetan. Mr. Kosuga is said to have tried to change the traditional way of dealing with banks by distancing itself from Mitsubishi and approaching Sanwa Bank. From now on, banks will make clearer distinction between the corporations they will support and those they will not. Corporations must forsake the concept that "they have the main bank as their lender of last resort." They must learn to deal with banks without getting attached to them. "The time will come when corporations will choose banks and banks will choose corporations" (Financial Research Room manager at Sakura Research Institute). [23 Feb 94 p 1] [Text] (3) The Third "Good-By, Banks!" A manager at a long-term credit bank listens carefully every day to the news about issuance of bonds with a little concern. His main concern is Mitsubishi Corporation's plan to issue five-year straight bonds (SB). As a result of reviewing the regulations and customary practice, they virtually removed the restriction on issuance of five-year SB's, which they had asked companies to limit because "their five-year SB's would compete with the five-year interest-bearing bonds issued by long-term credit banks." Nippon Steel Corp., Orix, Tokyu Land Corp., and Nissan Motor have already issued the five-year SB's. Issuance of the five-year SB's means that the cost incurred, when a corporation raises five-year, long-term funds directly from the market, will be exposed to the public eye. Mitsubishi Corp. is considering issuance of more than 100 billion yen worth of the bonds, which is considerably above its normal amount of 20 billion yen. If the bonds continue to be issued this way, it will make interest-bearing bonds less attractive" (a manager at a long-term credit bank). In addition, if Mitsubishi Corp., which is ranked higher than long-term credit banks, continued to issue this type, it will be able to issue bonds at the same or lower cost. The difference in creditworthiness of corporations and financial institutions as shown by this ranking really means something. If this scenario becomes true, the very purpose of long-term credit banks, which boasted that they were leading industrial finance, may be questioned. Issuance of bonds, which costs less than the long-term prime rate (the best loan interest), is already becoming a reality. Following this, some corporations may demand loans with interest rates lower than the long-term prime rate. Some say that "the long-term prime rate is based on the yield of interest-bearing bonds, plus 0.9 percent. This system may be shaky" (manager at The Industrial Bank of Japan, Securities Dept.). "Good-bye, banks! Part Three...," one accounting manager of a major corporation explained, using words sounding like a movie title. Part One was in the 1950's and 1960's, when there was an investment trust boom, mainly among individual investors. Part Two was in the 1970's and 1980's, when there was a shift in the financial trend toward direct financing by equity financing (funding with new issuance of stocks). Both parts ended with a sudden drop in stock price. Now, for the third time, a trend of "breaking away from banks" is beginning to take place. Yuraku Real Estate Co. is increasing use of funds raised by the deposit in Taisei Corp., its parent company. The amount of deposit was 13 billion yen at the end of March 1992. It has grown to 20 billion yen now. According to Taisei, "for Yuraku Real Estate Co., our interest is better than banks, and for us, their deposit is always better than getting a loan from banks." According to Bank of Japan statistics, the spread of banks' deposit and lending interest (average lending interest rate minus free interest term deposit interest) grew from 0.5 percent at the end of 1989 to over 2 percent in 1993 (month end average from January to November). Banks had to rush to secure a certain interest spread. Corporations competed with them. More and more companies are opting to have new money products, such as MMF (money market funds), and bonds, rather than depositing in banks. At Nippon Kayaku Co., the balance of short-term securities as of November 1993 was 16.3 billion yen, which was a big jump from the previous year's 0.1 billion yen. This is a result of moving bank deposits to MMF. Major corporations, such as Nissan Motor and All Nippon Airways, have begun to accelerate their operational funds' shift to bonds since the end of 1992. More and more corporations are preferring better yield on their operational funds than long-term relationship with banks. The boom in warrant bonds (debentures with preemptive rights) has ended, and the ratio of loan is increasing as a funding method. This may seem like the trend of "breaking away from banks" is being stopped. However, the power relationship between leading corporations and banks is definitely changing. "The main bank is Japan Development Bank." As of the end of September 1993, the long-term and short-term loan balance of Tokyo Gas Co. was 80 billion yen, of which 54 billion yen was loaned from Japan Development Bank. This was its largest loan. For the current term, Tokyo Gas Co. raised 70 billion yen externally, 54 billion yen from corporate bonds, and 16 billion yen from a loan from Japan Development Bank. Why Japan Development Bank? Japan Development Bank' loan interest rates are sometimes higher than the long-term prime rate. However, the bank allows long-term fixed-rate loans, such as 15-year loans, while most other banks want to use variable interest rates. In the long run this may be more profitable. Tokyo Electric Power Co. borrowed from regional financial institutions which are affiliated with the Norinchukin Bank [Central Bank for Agriculture and Forestry]. This was because of the installation of "competition system" which allowed them to select a financial institution to borrow money from. In the "competition system", Tokyo Electric Power Co. would have each financial institution propose its conditions concerning the amount, term, and interest rate, and the company would take the loan which would be most beneficial. An individual financial institution's loan terms used to be a fixed condition which was decided by share distribution. From now on "it will be possible that loan terms will vary depending on the individual financial institutions" (top-level executive at Tokyo Electric Power Co.). The corporate trend to break away from banks, which had apparently stopped, has been continuing. Shigeru Watanabe, chief of the Corporate Finance Research Room at Nomura Research Institute, affirms, "concerning major corporations, banks have no controlling power." The relationship between corporations and banks is becoming more and more distant, though it has not gone as far as it has in the United States, where corporations base their decision on cost. The third "Good-bye, Banks!" is different from the first two in the sense that "banks that used to have enough power are now exhausted" (executive at Industrial Bank of Japan). As long as banks function as the place to operate the funds or the fund provider is weakening, large and powerful corporations have no choice but to be selective in choosing their correspondent banks. With the trend of financial deregulation, power relationship between banks and corporations is even more accelerated. [24 Feb 94 p 1] [Text] (4) Hesitant in Providing Risk Money There was a demand for 8.7302 million shares against 550,000 shares that were offered for public subscription. A tender for Koekisha's public offering was held on the 21st. Koekisha is the first funeral company in Japan to be listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The demand was 15.9 times more than the number of shares they offered. It was September 1992 when Koekisha applied to be listed on the Stock Exchange. However, it was put on a waiting list for a year and a half for the reason that "excess supply of new stocks may cause stock prices to fall." The people at Koekisha, who had to wait, are feeling uneasy after seeing the popularity of their stocks. They do have complaints and distrust about this wait. They seem to think that "placing the stock on the market will activate the stock market." However, public subscription was like a "hostage" and "until the company gets listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, we could not do anything to upset the authorities" (executive of C.I. Kosei Co., which was listed on the Stock Exchange at the end of last year). In Koekisha's case, "fortunately the delay in offering for public subscription did not alter its plan of funding or management" (Koji Konishi, Koekisha's Management Planning Room chief). However, it is possible that this kind of delay may cause an unrecoverable loss for a corporation. Yu Inaba, deputy director of the Sales Planning Department at Nikko Securities Co., points out, "Sometimes the ranking in an industry can be affected by even a slight difference in timing. A company may grow very rapidly as soon as it starts public sale of shares, while another company may be right behind it on the waiting list, but could not start its public sale of shares until a little later." As a matter of fact, one company in 30 has had to give up being listed on the Stock Exchange while it was still on the waiting list. At present, new public offerings of stocks are limited to a total of three companies a week in the stock exchange and over-the-counter markets combined. More than 120 companies have applied to go public based on their 1992 business results and are still on the waiting list. Including those that applied in 1993, about 200 companies are crowding the waiting circle. "For securities companies, whose profit comes mainly from sales and purchases fees, securing the sales amount by maintaining the market is vitally important" (president of Chuken Securities Co.). This way of thinking is dominant. The Ministry of Finance is also involved in interfering with the supply of "risk money" to growing corporations, for the reason of protecting investors. "Promotion of newly established businesses is an urgent task in reviving the blocked-up Japanese economy. However, funding restrictions are a major obstacle..." The first meeting of "the Subcommittee on Funding Environment Improvement Concerning New Businesses" was held on 26 January on the 17th floor of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] building. This subcommittee is a part of the Industrial Structure Council's Industrial Finance Committee. "Venture companies are lacking in collateral and credit, it is hard to receive loans from financial institutions." "Due to various regulations and customary practices, it is difficult for them to participate in capital markets." The subcommittee attacked banks and securities companies. MITI officials showed their frustration, saying, "Unless we let the new group of companies grow, there is no future for Japan." To this, the securities companies and MITI reacted rather coolly. The Japan Securities Dealers Association, which is working on reforming the over-the-counter market, said, "there is no discussion of opening up the market by lowering the standard of criteria for public sale of stocks." On the contrary, they say that a series of bankruptcy of several corporations listed on the over-the-counter market shows that corporations must be examined more closely at the time of their application and disclosure (releasing information) should be emphasized. MOF is also ignoring MITI, using the excuse of "protecting investors." Securities companies are also hesitant about opening up the market, saying, "we need to consider first the corporations that are already listed" (an executive of a major securities company). Banks are not fulfilling their function as risk-money suppliers to small and midsized businesses, either. Junichi Miyake, vice chairman of the Japan Research Institute, recollected, "at the last yearend party, I had an unpleasant encounter with the chairman of a major city bank." It was because Mr. Miyake expressed his own opinion that "small and midsized businesses are in a credit crunch." The chairman insisted that "there is no hesitation by banks about lending money." The two were not able to agree on this issue at the party. According to The Bank of Japan's "Evaluation of Financial Institutions' Attitude on Loans DI (`lenient' minus `severe')," the figure for major corporations was -9 as of November 1992; and the figure became positive in August 1993, and in November the figure was 1. The attitude is clearly improving [banks are getting more lenient in financing major corporations]. During this time, the figure for small and midsized businesses changed from 0 to 5. The figure was 3 last November, and the change is not as drastic. An executive chairman of one credit bank confided, "Since city banks are not responding to corporations' request for additional loans, they come crying to local credit banks for loans." Hurt by the collapse of the "bubble," banks are more cautious about taking risks. A top executive of a top-ranking bank insists, "Banks' general attitude of lending money to anyone with collateral is being corrected. It is not that we are hesitant to give loans." On the other hand, some criticize banks for "lacking the ability to examine companies, and take business as a security." Venture capital (VC), which was originally for promoting the growth of venture enterprises, is not functioning properly. The investment balance of VC, as of the end of 1992, was 876.1 billion yen (67 companies responded to Nikkei VC survey). Compared to the previous year, this amount was 15 billion yen less. This is because each company has been reorganizing its investments. Cases are increasing where VC requests company owners to buy back their stocks. In their attempt to recover funds from their investments, this is the last resort for corporations, which rapidly expanded their investments, taking advantage of the "bubble economy" and the VC boom. "They supplied us with the risk money to begin with. It is unreasonable for them to demand it back when our business doesn't do well." "Venture capital is a false sign." Venture enterprises are expressing their dissatisfaction. The Banking and securities industry is not trying to understand the needs of venture businesses that want to grow. The industry is not able to measure the potential of these businesses, or it may be that it is not trying to do so. The supply of risk money will continue to decrease, unless they start understanding each other. [25 Feb 94 p 1] [Text] (5) Battle Between Banks and Securities Companies It was 24 February. The phone rang at the manager's desk in the Corporation Department at the Yamato Securities Co. annex in Yaesu, Tokyo. "Concerning the SB's, which are planned to be issued the end of this month, we have decided to ask Yamaichi Securities, Nikko Securities, and IBJ [Industrial Bank of Japan] Securities to be the managing underwriters." The caller was an accounting executive at Nissan Motor. At that moment, it was decided that IBJ Securities obtained the position as a managing underwriter in a Japanese company's domestic bonds issuance. Until then, Nissan had always appointed the three major securities companies, Yamaichi, Nikko, and Daiwa, to be at the top of the managing underwriter syndicate. For Daiwa, "we were very much shocked that we were the only one removed from the managing underwriter position" (Masatake Makino, Daiwa executive manager). It is not unusual for Nissan, which once brought in a president and a vice president from the Industrial Bank of Japan, to give IBJ Securities Co. the honor of being a managing underwriter. However, Nissan's getting too close to IBJ Securities may cause the balance among the other financial institutions to be lost. One Nissan executive confided, "we wanted to avoid being the first one to do this." Their struggle to maintain the balance is evident. They even divided their issuance of SB's into three parts, 20 billion yen each, to let Yamaichi and Nikko be managing underwriters, also. The underwriting ratio of the three parts total is in the order of Yamaichi, Nikko, Daiwa, and IBJ Securities. Nissan's urgent problem is to reduce its interest-bearing debts. They need to pay off the same amount of debt with funding from SB's. They chose relatively low-interest commercial paper. Normally, they should pay off bank loans which have high interest rates. However, being concerned about offending financial institutions, they wanted to avoid the change in loan share. It was last July when IBJ Securities Co. opened for business. It joined the managing underwriter syndicate through SB's issued by Nissan, Nippon Steel Corp., Tokyo Electric Power Co., and Fujitsu. It was also able to get into the managing underwriter syndicate in the issuance of Cosmo Oil Co.'s convertible bonds (CB's) planned for mid-March. "We regret that we could not maintain our position as the managing underwriter." The underwriting manager of New Japan Securities Co. visited underwriting departments of the four major securities companies. The purpose of his visits was to report that their position as the managing underwriter for a midsized construction company, Oki Construction Co., was taken by Fuji Bank's local Swiss corporation in the issuance of foreign currency warrant bonds which is to take place on the Swiss market at the end of March. Underwriting of equity financing (funding with new issuance of stocks) is an area that existing securities companies would not want to give up. It makes sense that New Japan Securities went to apologize to other companies in the industry. This is why securities companies put up strong resistance to banks' aggressive operation, and corporations caught in between did not know what to do. Last October, Aichi Tokei Denki Co. issued warrant bonds in Swiss francs, with a midsized Swiss bank as its managing underwriter. There also was a twist to this. Aichi Tokei's main bank, the Industrial Bank of Japan, moved to make its foreign subsidiary the first managing underwriter for this type of bond issuance. Aichi's managing underwriter, Nikko, noticed the move and tried to stop them. It sent its Nagoya Branch manager, Takao Matsui (now a managing director), and even Takao Nakanishi, a managing director from Tokyo, to Aichi Tokei. The accounting manager of Aichi Tokei, who was hurrying to raise funds, did not know what to do. At last, Aichi decided not to appoint either of them as the managing underwriter, thus saving face for both Nikko and IBJ. Aichi's accounting executive talked, looking back, "when a company has some history, it is difficult to cut off past relationship completely." When for the first time IBJ of Switzerland became the managing underwriter for Riken's warrant bonds in Swiss francs, three major securities companies except Yamaichi, which had been Riken's underwriter, refused to join the syndicate and caused trouble. Despite the fact that Shoji Saotome, managing director of Yamaichi, tried to persuade Riken to change its plan, Riken would not change its plan of the issuance. "Even if the four major securities companies all decided not to cooperate, Riken would still have gone ahead with the plan" (Mr. Saotome). This was how strong the tie was between Riken and the Industrial Bank of Japan. There were, however, some companies that refused to be involved in the battle between banks and securities companies, and that have their own opinions. When Kobe Steel Ltd. issued Euroyen bonds last December, the four major securities companies did not join the syndicate, complaining that the fee standard that was proposed by a foreign corporation of a bank was too low. Kobe Steel offered a 0.1 percent fee, and IBJ, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, and Sanwa Bank's London corporations accepted it. Securities companies suggested a fee of 0.3 percent, and that the adjustment be made through issuance price, saying that "accepting a 0.1 percent fee may cause their fee structure to collapse." However, negotiation was never made. As a result, Kobe Steel was able to raise funds effectively. Concerning existing securities companies, they feel that "they are sticking too much to traditional practice" (an executive). In the application for domestic SB's issuance registration they submitted to MOF, Kobe Steel added IBJ Securities Co. to the four major securities companies in the managing underwriter candidates column. Some are raising question about bank tactics that resemble dumping. In the Euromarket, foreign corporations of Japanese banks continue to issue bonds with interest levels lower the market rate. Last April, Yoshida Kogyo issued SB's in Euroyen, with a London corporation of IBJ as its managing underwriter. The issue terms were about 0.3 percent below the market. This issue, which ignored the market, was refused by investors, and the company ended up with many unsold stocks. The investors accused them of "making SB's like loans." Some IBJ members say that they regret this now. SB issuers may raise funds with low interest at the time, however, "they will eventually lose public trust" (Rei Ogino, managing director of Nomura Securities Co.) if they keep up this financing method which does not suit the market. It will take a long time before corporations are be able to effectively raise funds. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |The issuers of SB's in Euroyen for which foreign corporations of Japanese ba-| |nks were appointed managing underwriters in the period between April and Dec-| |ember 1993: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Lead Underwriter |Issuers | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |IBJ |Yoshida Kogyo, Nissan Motors, Kobe St-| | |eel Mfg. | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank |Toyobo, Itochu, Ashihara Mfg., Seiyu, | | |Nissho Iwai, Kobe Steel | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Bank of Tokyo |Marubeni, Mitsui & Co. | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Sakura Bank |Mitsui Trading Co., Tostem, Toray Ind-| | |ustries, Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Mitsubishi Bank |Mitsubishi Chemical, Mitsubishi Mater-| | |ial, Kirin International, Toda Corp., | | |Mitsubishi Oil Co. | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Fuji Bank |Tokyo Tatemono, Marubeni, Canon, Mits-| | |ui & Co., Nichirei Co., Kao Corp.,| | | Nissan Motors, NTT, Data Communicati-| | |on, Taisei Corp., Nippon Seiko | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Sumitomo Bank |Sanyo Electric, Sumitomo America, Maz-| | |da, Kao Corp., Hankyu Railway, Sumito-| | |mo Electric Finance | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Daiwa Bank |Osaka Gas | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Sanwa Bank |Nichimen, Hankyu Railway, Takashimaya,| | | Nissho Iwai, Nitto Electric Netherla-| | |nds, Takashimaya International, Kobe | | |Steel | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tokai Bank |Uny | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Asahi Bank |SMC | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(Note) Survey by a major securities company | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [1 Mar 94 p 1] [Text] (6) Many Asian Corporations of Japanese Companies Are Getting Listed on the Local Stock Exchange "Starting with next year's account settlement, we are preparing to consolidate the Asia region's settlement of accounts. Kazuhiko Yamazaki, president of Fujikura Asia (FAL), a Singapore corporation of Fujikura Corp., a major manufacturer of electric cables in Japan, began to speak. FAL is the center for Fujikura's Southeast Asia operation, approved by the Singapore Government to be OHQ (operational headquarters), which is granted special tax treatment. By issuing corporate bonds and taking full advantage of their location at the financial center, they are to raise low-interest funds, and to play the role of supplier of funds to production bases in other Asian countries. Leading the consolidation of the settlements, they are the "Asian headquarters." FAL has leased over 0.2 billion yen to Fujikura Federal Cable [FFC], a Malaysian electric cable company. FAL has financed 90 percent of the capital to Shukai Fujikura Denso, a producer of wire harness in Shukai economic special district in China, in place of their Tokyo headquarters. FAL is funded by issuance of bonds in Eurodollars and loans from local banks. "Our funds are raised in the most effective market in Asia" (Mr. Yamazaki, president of FAL). FAL has established this system without any help from their Japanese main banks. With Fuji Xerox added last year, a total of eight companies have been approved as OHQ. Whether designated OHQ or not, increasing numbers of Japanese corporations in Singapore are issuing convertible bonds and commercial paper. This means the movement to use direct financing is accelerating among Japanese companies that have gone into Asia. FFC began full-scale production of optic fiber cable in a part of Pulai Industrial Park across from Penang Island, which is known as an international resort. They have already begun construction of additional facilities. Because Malaysia is making an effort to improve its communication infrastructure, the demand for the cable has skyrocketed, and FFC is in need of major expansion of its facility. What they came up with to satisfy this high demand for funds was to get listed on the stock exchange. "We may be able to apply based on the settlement of March next year," Hideo Sano, president of FFC, smilingly said. As of the end of 1992, more than 850 Japanese corporations have gone into Malaysia. Among these corporations, only a few companies, such as Matsushita Electric Corporation's Malaysian operation, are listed on the stock exchange. Under the present situation where the capital is provided 100 percent by Japanese parent companies, "there is no benefit to getting listed on the stock exchange" (Hiroyuki Shirafuji, president of Matsushita Television, Malaysia). Only 17 companies listed on the stock exchange have 5 percent or more of the capital provided by Japanese capital (survey by a local commercial bank). Recently, however, the trend is changing. The Malaysian Government has begun to request that Japanese corporations be listed on the stock exchange. Localization may be to their advantage in receiving project orders. Stock markets in Asian countries have grown rapidly, and their aggregate market value even exceeds that of the Second Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. They have more means of raising funds than before, and Japanese corporations' local companies are beginning to be listed on the local stock exchange. Mitsuo Saito, president of Shanghai Air Conditioner, which is Sharp Corporation's joint venture, said, "that's the only way." Shanghai Air Conditioner Corp. began manufacturing air conditioners last December in the "Hoto Development Area" in Shanghai, China. "The only way" is for them to be listed on the stock exchange. In China, due to monetary restraints, local foreign corporations are troubled by a shortage of gen. "Business has gone smoothly this year, and 65 percent of the amount payable is in gen." They have a big problem. "We have already consulted some local Japanese companies on getting listed on the stock exchange," confided Yuichiro Sekine, Nomura Securities' Shanghai branch office manager." As of the end of January, 115 companies were listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Five of them are joint corporations with foreign capital. "It is a matter of time for Japanese joint companies to be listed" (a Japanese city bank's Shanghai branch office). In Hong Kong, Jusco Stores, Hong Kong, which is Jusco's local company in Hong Kong, became listed on the local stock exchange. In Singapore, several companies, such as Mitsubishi Corp.-related companies, have been listed, starting with Hitachi Shipbuilding Singapore in November 1992. Following these movements by corporations, local companies of securities companies and Japanese banks have begun a fierce competition. The Bank of Tokyo sent its international business commissioner, Mr. Ryozo Kakitsubo, as an adviser to Bumiputra Merchants Bankers the end of last year. Bumiputra is the fifth-ranked commercial bank in Malaysia, and Tokyo Bank is financing them. Mr. Kakitsubo's mission was to obtain the position of the managing underwriter in the Japanese corporations' public issuance of stocks. Mr. Kakitsubo estimates that "about 20 companies are considering going public." He has been busy meeting with local Japanese corporations. Tokio Takezawa, president of Sanwa International Finance (SIF), Sanwa Bank's Hong Kong securities company, said, "An increasing number of business trips to Shanghai are being taken from Japanese banks' Hong Kong securities companies." Nomura Research Institute, Hong Kong, has employed a special analyst to study corporations in Shanghai this year. "Nomura's enemies are not Nikko or Yamaichi. Rather, they are the European and U.S. securities companies and Japanese banks' local companies, such as Sanwa (a securities analyst in Hong Kong). SIF has had good results in competition for the position of the leading underwriter in issuance of stocks. This year so far, only Nomura International (Hong Kong), Nomura Securities' local company, obtain the position of the leading underwriter. Japanese securities companies do not seem to be doing well. This year, within Japan several securities companies have been established as subsidiaries of city banks, and the time is about to end when banks could sit peacefully on titles, such as "main bank" and "leading underwriter". Right now, an opening match is taking place among banks, securities companies, and corporations in Asia where the wall of restriction is low, and the issue is how to respond to corporations' needs.
