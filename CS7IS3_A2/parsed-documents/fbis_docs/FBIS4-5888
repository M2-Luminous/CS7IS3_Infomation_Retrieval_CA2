The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said the move was initiated by the association's special committee on minivehicles headed by Osamu Suzuki, president of Suzuki Motor Corp. The association will formally decide on details of standard expansion, including the size of vehicles and maximum engine capacity, association officials said. They said it is likely that the maximum engine capacity for minivehicles will be raised to 800 cc from the present 660 cc. The Transport Ministry will launch a study on the modification of minivehicle standards after the committee comes up with a formal proposal, the officials said.
