The decree stated that President Joao Bernardo Vieira chose that date following the proposal by the National Electoral Commission to hold the elections between 26 June and 10 July. The elections were initially scheduled for 27 March, but were postponed. The announcement of the new election date comes a day after the Electoral Commission published the official and final electoral list of 404,521 voters. Bissau, which has 97,520 voters, represents nearly a quarter of the electorate. This gives it the right to have 20 parliamentarians. Thirteen parties, including 12 opposition parties, have already begun their campaigns, while two other parties -- the Socialist Party and the National Convention -- await legalization. Six candidates, all of whom are from the opposition, have already joined the presidential race. Their main objective is to defeat President "Nino" Vieira, 60, who came to power on 14 November 1980, as well as his party, the African Party for the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde [PAIGC], which led the country to independence on 10 September 1974. Aboubacar Djalo, leader of the Ecological Protection League, is the candidate for the "Union for Change," which is a coalition of six parties including the Democratic Front, the Democratic and Social Front, the United Movement for Development, the Party for the People's Development, the Party for Renovation and Development, and the Ecological Protection League. Other presidential aspirants are current President Joao Bernardo Vieira, PAIGC chairman; Domingos Fernandes Gomes, the Guinea-Bissau Resistance-Bafata Movement leader; Victor Saude Maria, chairman of the United Social Democratic Party; and Kumba Iala, leader of the Party for Social Renovation. Francois Kankoila Mendy, leader of the Guinea-Bissau National Liberation Front, and Carlos Domingos Gomes, an independent candidate backed by the Party for Democratic Convergence, are also in the race. It is the country's first multiparty election since independence.
