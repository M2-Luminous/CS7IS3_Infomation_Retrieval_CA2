FR940505-0-00025 FR940505-0-00005 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;54&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8905; AD 94&hyph;09&hyph;16] Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Model A300&hyph;600 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Model A300&hyph;600 series airplanes. This action requires replacement of certain Feel and Limitation Computers (FLC) with modified FLC's. This amendment is prompted by reports that the elevator control on several in-service airplanes operated with stiffness. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent stiff operation of the elevator control and undetected loss of the rudder travel limitation function, which may adversely affect controllability of the airplane. Effective DATES: May 20, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of May 20, 1994. Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before July 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;54&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Airbus Industrie, 1 Rond Point Maurice Bellonte, 31707 Blagnac Cedex, France. This information may be examined at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Stephen Slotte, Aerospace Engineer, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2797; fax (206) 227&hyph;1320. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Direction Général de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Airbus Model A300&hyph;600 series airplanes. The DGAC advises that operators of Model A300&hyph;600 series airplanes reported that the elevator control on several in-service airplanes operated with stiffness. Investigation into the cause of this stiffness revealed that the Feel and Limitation Computer (FLC) may be detecting spurious low voltage. This condition, if not corrected, could result in stiff operation of the elevator control and undetected loss of the rudder travel limitation function, which may adversely affect controllability of the airplane. Airbus has issued Service Bulletin A300&hyph;27&hyph;6025, dated September 15, 1993, that describes procedures for replacement of certain FLC's with modified FLC's. These replacement FLC's have been modified in accordance with Aerospatiale Service Bulletin 35&hyph;900&hyph;27&hyph;013, dated September 29, 1993 (for FLC's having part number 35&hyph;900&hyph;2000&hyph;200), or Aerospatiale Service Bulletin 35&hyph;900&hyph;27&hyph;012, dated September 29, 1993 (for FLC's having part number 35&hyph;900&hyph;2000&hyph;201). The Aerospatiale service bulletins describe procedures for adjustment of the ``UNDERVOLTAGE DETECTION'' signal with new values to preclude stiff operation of the elevator control. The DGAC classified the Airbus service bulletin as mandatory and issued French Airworthiness Directive 94&hyph;046&hyph;156(B), dated February 16, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France.
