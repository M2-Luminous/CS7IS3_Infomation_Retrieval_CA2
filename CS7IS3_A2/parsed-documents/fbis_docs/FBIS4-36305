On 28 and 29 May, AL-JUMHURIYAH noticed relative stability in prices and a rush by citizens to buy vegetables and fruit, which had seen prices skyrocket during the blessed 'Id al-Adha holidays. The price hikes were caused by the greed of shopkeepers and grocers who insist on maintaining this situation in the market, disregarding the suffering of citizens, especially low-income citizens. At the beginning of their campaign, the men of the Economic Crime Combat Department made sure materials sold at the prices set by the state's agencies. In some cases, they took charge of direct selling to the public. AL-JUMHURIYAH toured the main fruit and vegetable marketplaces. It noticed a drop in prices in comparison with the 'Id al-Adha prices. In interviews with AL-JUMHURIYAH, citizens expressed appreciation for this experience, hoping that prices will continue to drop or at least remain stable. Colonel Diya' Qaddah 'Abd-al-Ghaffar, chief of the Economic Crime Combat Department, spoke about the dimensions of the new campaign and its effective results to stabilize prices. He noted citizens' satisfaction with this campaign. He said that during the past two days, inspectors have reported many price violations, especially of vegetable and fruit prices. He said the fine for the first price violation has been set at 10,000 dinars. If the violation is repeated, the fine will be doubled. This is especially necessary because it has been noted that some vendors raise prices beyond normal ranges, overburdening low-income citizens. He told AL-JUMHURIYAH that the department has controlled the process of selling agricultural crops, obligating farmers to sell their crops at the marketing offices in accordance with official prices and under the supervision of economic crime combat men. He said this move has been effective in making available plenty of crops and commodities. He said this has resulted in increasing supply and reducing prices. He said that this comprehensive campaign at marketplaces started after many citizens complained about conditions in the marketplaces and unjustifiable price increases. He said this campaign will continue "nonstop", to put an end to whoever is deluded into tampering with the people's subsistence. He said that during the past two days, inspectors closed 58 vegetable shops and confiscated their contents. They also seized large quantities of banned materials, such as imported cigarettes. Soft drinks factories, he noted, have been uncovered in many areas of Baghdad, especially in the al-Dawrah area. Samples of their products have been sent to laboratories to ensure their fitness for human consumption. The colonel stressed that the objective of this campaign is to serve citizens and to end price violations and fraud in the marketplaces. He said the economic crime combat men have apprehended a large number of people who had impersonated economic security men, prompted by their greed to tamper with citizens' money and property. He said they had been wearing military uniform with guns on their waists, using vehicles similar to those used by the economic crime combat men, and carrying false identification. The director of the Economic Crime Combat Department stressed to AL-JUMHURIYAH that all divisions of the department have been mobilized to implement the "new plan." The objective of this plan is to ease citizens' burdens, he noted. He said the coming days will witness true improvement in the situation, in terms of commodities availability, prices, and stability. He urged citizens to cooperate with inspectors by reporting violations and contacting the complaints section on 8878319 so immediate deterrent measures can be taken against violators.
