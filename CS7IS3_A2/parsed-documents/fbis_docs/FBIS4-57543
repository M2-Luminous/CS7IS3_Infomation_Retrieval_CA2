The objective of their visit was to collect data on the Chilean economic model. As a result of this visit, last week, Minister Maira reported the implementation of a cooperation plan with the Caribbean island. Pressed by its worst crisis since the 1959 revolution, the Fidel Castro regime is opening up its economy as the only solution to the crisis that followed the fall of the Soviet communist bloc in 1991. Last week, Castro's administration implemented drastic reforms and austerity measures to fight the scarcity of currency, the budget deficit, the drop in the production level, and the black market. Among these reforms and measures are an increase in the price of basic services; new taxes; and the freezing of bank accounts with deposits higher than 10,000 Cuban pesos. Along with these measures, Cuba also began to send expert missions to collect information on the economic experiences of five countries. One of the countries chosen by the Cuban Government was Chile. For a week, the Cuban experts talked with officials from the Chilean Central Bank and the Ministries of Finance, Foreign Affairs, and Planning and Coordination. "They wanted to learn about the mechanisms of administering Chilean economic policy and the technical instruments with which we work," Maira said. The Cuban experts took copies of already executed programs from the Planning and Coordination Ministry as well as plans for integrated projects and the national investment system. They also learned about regional policies in detail. At the Central Bank, the Cubans analyzed subjects such as monetary, banking, and credit policy. They collected information on similar subjects in other ministries. According to Maira "it was something like an exhaustive trip to learn about the Chilean economic system, and they collected useful information because they are studying deep economic reforms. The short-term work they are carrying out here will therefore be very important for them." He stressed that "the Cubans know they must adjust their administrative apparatus, as their planned economy is inefficient," and that is why they are studying various experiences throughout the world that could inform their own decision. "They are seeking changes that will allow them to preserve the national elements of independence and the accomplishments attained through their former economic model. Their greatest asset is that from being a colony in 1959, they have become a country with national dignity," Maira said. He added that "we showed the Cubans our house; we explained to them our procedures, and they thanked us for this information." Maira said the Cuban delegation received a good impression of the capability and efficiency with which Chileans have administrated their economy in the public and private sectors. [passage omitted]
