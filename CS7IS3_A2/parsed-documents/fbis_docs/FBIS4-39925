Our correspondent met with the detachment commander, Rear Admiral Iliya Popov, Bulgarian navy chief of staff. [Pasyakin] Mr. Admiral, what is the purpose of your call? [Popov] In the first place, to continue the development of friendly links between our navies. Second, we wanted to give our commissioned and petty officers and seamen an opportunity to see the sights in this splendid Russian city and to meet with seamen of the Russian Federation Black Sea Fleet. We used the sea passage for combat training and improvement of our naval combat proficiency, including organizing the towing of ships and keeping watch, and for damage control exercises... [Pasyakin] In your view, what are the prospects for the development of relations between our countries and, accordingly, between navies? [Popov] I can only talk about relations between our navies, because relations between countries are the prerogative of presidents and governments. As well as the contacts that have already taken place between our navies, this year will see the "Briz-94" exercise, which is planned for 25-29 July. We have invited warships from many countries to the exercise. I am talking about two missile boats from the Romanian Navy, one ship each from the Ukrainian Navy and Russian Federation Black Sea Fleet, a Turkish frigate, two missile boats from the Greek Navy, and two ships from the U.S. 6th Fleet. Representatives from Georgia have been invited (we know it has no navy, but it does have access to the Black Sea). Recently I was told that Italy and France had shown an interest in this exercise. If they ask to be given the go-ahead to participate, obviously we will agree. As for contacts with the Russian Navy, we have already exchanged preliminary protocols, which we intend to sign. They take account of what kind of ties there will be between our navies. On the basis of the protocol we will then sign a bilateral cooperation plan. In July there will be the exercise I talked about. In August the training ship "Gangut," carrying students from Russian naval schools, will call on us in Varna. We have also planned some events for next year and they have already been agreed with our general staff. At the end of April, for example, we intend to hold a symposium, inviting all the countries of the Black Sea and Mediterranean regions. This symposium will be similar to the one in 1993. On that occasion we entertained visitors from 14 countries. This time we expect there to be more. [Pasyakin] What are the aims and tasks of the exercise you mentioned? [Popov] The task is Bulgarian Navy participation in peacemaking operations to provide humanitarian aid. The aims? First and foremost, to have the opportunity to get acquainted with representatives of the various fleets we have invited, to exchange experience. Second, to test communications and rehearse collaboration between ships from different states, and joint actions on damage control and protection of transports delivering humanitarian aid, and assisting a submarine "in distress"... In short, rehearsing episodes of a nonoffensive nature. [Pasyakin] Mr. Admiral, how does Bulgaria intend to update its navy? According to my information, you used to buy your ships and equipment from the USSR. [Popov] We are certainly faced with the task of updating our pool of ships. But it is too expensive buying other countries' ships. So this question, after consultation with the general staff and the Defense Ministry, evolved into the elaboration of our own national shipbuilding program. Civilian institutes with shipbuilding associations, shipyards, scientific research institutes, and plants producing what goes into ships -- communications facilities, radar and navigation equipment, armaments -- are participating in its creation. The approval of the program by the general staff military council is planned for the summer. Then it will go to the Council of Ministers for its approval. Why? Because the intention is that the money should come not from the Defense Ministry budget, but direct from the state budget. We are unable to buy foreign military technology with hard currency. It is very important too that the allocated funds should circulate within the country, creating jobs. We also want to involve other countries in the implementatioon of the program. And I am not just talking about foreign investments in our industry. You will agree that it is extravagant to make two or three ships just for our navy. Series production, that is, for other countries too, is cheaper. [Pasyakin] Incidentally, what class of ships do you intend to build? [Popov] Primarily, "corvette" class, of 900-1,2000 tonnes. But if we find a country that agrees to participate in this project, then serial production will increase, and we will even try to enter the world market. And not only with corvettes. I am talking about minesweepers and missile boats as well. [Pasyakin] Since we are talking about financial problems, the next question is what is the naval funding situation? At the reception on your ship I saw publicity from several Bulgarian firms... [Popov] The finance, and I am talking about the upkeep of ships, seamen's pay, and all the rest, comes out of the state budget. As for visits and foreign port calls by our ships, like this one, we get a lot of help from sponsors -- individual firms with which we conclude contracts. Sponsorship takes the form of goods. Gifts, souvenirs, food, drink. We are forbidden to accept money. We, in turn, advertise these firms' goods in foreign ports. [Pasyakin] Mr. Admiral, what is Bulgarian military doctrine in relation to your navy based on today? [Popov] A military doctrine has been adopted in Bulgaria which obliges us to defend the country. It is not possible for us to create a big navy in the Black Sea. The navies of the Black Sea states are much stronger than ours. The idea behind the development of the Bulgarian Navy, in accordance with the military doctrine, is based on the navy's basic task of weakening as much as possible forces that are trying to attack us from the sea. That is, to cause the enemy losses that would frustrate its aggressive plans. That is, the navy's tasks are purely defensive. [Pasyakin] I know that the Soviet Navy's ships used to be repaired at Bulgaria's "Flotski Arsenal" and "Odessos" yards. What is the state of affairs in this sphere today? [Popov] It is difficult to give a full answer, because the repair yard in Varna is not under naval control, but is directly linked to the ministry. I cannot say what the enterprise's plans are, but I would point out that a delegation from the Russian Defense Ministry went to Varna in April. An understanding was reached on the repair of Russian ships at our yard. We are interrested in these contacts. Russian orders will strengthen the yard's position, and ours too, since "Flotski Arsenal" also repairs the Bulgarian Navy's ships.
