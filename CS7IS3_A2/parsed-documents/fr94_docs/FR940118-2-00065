FR940118-2-00065 FR940118-2-00047 The United States, Dresser, and Baroid have agreed that the proposed Final Judgment may be entered after compliance with the APPA. Entry of the proposed Final Judgment will terminate the action, except that the Court will retain jurisdiction to construe, modify and enforce the Final Judgment, and to punish violations of the Final Judgment. II Events Giving Rise to the Alleged Violation On September 7, 1993, Dresser and Baroid entered into a purchase agreement under which the two companies would merge and Baroid would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dresser. This acquisition would, if unchallenged, effectively merge all of the businesses of Dresser and Baroid, including their drilling fluid and diamond drill bit businesses. The purchase price is approximately $900 million. Dresser and Baroid are both large, diversified oil field service companies that provide a wide variety of products and services necessary to explore for and develop oil and gas reserves. Dresser reported total 1992 sales of about $3.8 billion; Baroid's total 1992 sales were approximately $614.4 million. The Complaint alleges that there are two markets in which Dresser and Baroid are significant competitors. Those two markets are the manufacture and sale in the United States of drilling fluids and the manufacture and sale in the United States of diamond drill bits. Both products are used by drilling operators to drill for oil and gas. Wells are drilled using a drill pipe (or ``drill string''), which is a heavy-walled pipe assembled end-to-end from thirty- to forty-foot sections. The drill string is suspended from the mast of a drilling rig and lowered gradually as the earth is penetrated. As the drill string is rotated, the earth is cut by a drill bit, 1 which is attached to the end of the drill string or to a motor that is attached to the end of the drill string. Drilling fluid is pumped under pressure through the drill string to the drill bit at the end of the string. Drilling fluid, a mixture of natural and synthetic chemical compounds (principally barite and bentonite), improves the performance and durability of the drill string and the tools in the hole by, for example, cooling and lubricating the drill bit and controlling downhole pressure. 1 There are two types of drill bits: tricone drill bits and diamond drill bits. Tricone bits consist of three steel cones that rotate as the bit turns. Diamond drill bits have no moving parts but contain cutting elements made of natural or synthetic diamond embedded in the bottom and sides of a steel or matrix body. The kind of drill bits used in a particular drilling operation depends upon the depth of the well, the direction of the drilling, the type of formation through which the drill bit must cut, and the type of drilling fluid used. Diamond drill bits provide higher penetration rates, better durability, and require the drill string to be pulled out of the well hole fewer times than tricone bits. Diamond bits typically cost between three and eight times as much as tricone bits. Where daily drilling costs are high and the geological conditions are suitable, customers prefer to use diamond bits over tricone bits in order to reduce drilling time and, thereby, lower overall costs. Both drilling fluids and diamond drill bits are critical products for oil and gas exploration and development. The use of an incorrectly formulated drilling fluid can result in a costly, dangerous hole blow-out or the immobilization of the drill string. The percentage of total drilling costs accounted for by drilling fluids can be as high as 10 percent. The percentage of total drilling costs accounted for by drill bits is less, usually no more than 5 percent, but the cost of a bit failure can be very high. Valuable drilling time is lost because the entire drill string must be pulled out of the hole, disassembled, a new bit attached, and the drill string reassembled and run back into the hole. M&hyph;I is a vertically integrated company with mining operations, manufacturing plants, research and engineering facilities, distribution facilities and sales and service centers located throughout the world. M&hyph;I's worldwide, net sales of drilling fluids for fiscal year 1992 and $383.6 million. Its domestic sales were approximately $110 million. Baroid Drilling produces and sells drilling fluids through a distribution network consisting of approximately 150 onshore and offshore stockpoints and over 50 field laboratories. In 1992, Baroid Drilling's worldwide, net sales were $331.5 million, and its domestic sales were approximately $100 million.
