Shulepina: "Energy Systems and Gas Pipelines Are Indivisible"] [Text] Beating politicians, energy officials were first to reach agreement on creating an integrated energy space, which they did two years ago. They serve the Greater Central Asian Energy Ring. A joint dispatching administration in Tashkent handles operations--determining station loads, operating modes, and maintenance schedules. It is subordinate to a council of energy industry officials of the region's republics, who meet to agree on who will produce how much and who will buy it. An agreement has also been reached on cooperation between gas industry officials. How are the republics building their relations in the highly complex fuel and energy complex today? A PRAVDA VOSTOKA correspondent put this question to Erken Anafin, Kazakhstan's deputy minister of energy and fuel resources. We get 600 million kilowatt-hours of Uzbek electricity annually. More than 3 billion more kilowatt-hours of Turkmenian and Kyrgyz electricity are supplied to Kazakhstan via Uzbekistan. For example, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan have energy surpluses, while Kazakhstan has a shortage in winter. And so our colleagues help us out. We had a difficult situation on our hands in the spring of this year as well. The Dzhambyl hydroelectric station was operating a single power unit, while five others were idled on account of fuel problems. We bought Uzbek gas on credit, as there was no fuel oil since we had not received petroleum from Russia. The Kzyl-Orda Heat and Power Station is powered by Angrei coal. And another payment problem arose. Energy was cheap in Kazakhstan until recently, and so the industry operated at a loss. The tenge dropped in value, and our partners lacked hard currency too. And so we agreed to keep our mutual accounts in dollars. But when it came time to settle, we had nothing with which to pay. We owe Uzbekistan $98 million for electricity and gas. The Uzbek side's debt to us is only one-tenth of that. It was a tough situation. We started looking for solutions. And we took drastic measures. They were economically warranted and fully in keeping with the spirit of a market economy. We raised electricity prices twice in spring, so that the prices were comparable to production costs. The gas situation was also resolved in a market spirit. We cut off the gas to those who had not paid. We cut consumption to 40 percent. Is that a little or a lot? We received 6.2 billion cubic meters of gas from Uzbekistan via the Gazli-Chimkent gas pipeline last year. This year we have ordered 4.2 billion, and we are not even using all of that. We took 1.3 billion in the first four months, but paid for 400 million. The Uzbek side took an understanding view of our situation, and said: Take what you need within the agreed-upon amounts. But we squeezed our enterprises. We are in a difficult transitional period. There is no longer any rigid state regulation in Kazakhstan. As an experiment we are introducing the use of bills of exchange to settle accounts. For example, if you cannot pay in cash, we will take payment in copper or lead. The legislative basis for this is being created. The Kazakh president issued an edict in April on securities. The matter is now being worked out in the Economics and Finance Ministries. In the meantime we are trying to utilize clearing settlements. This is not all that easy. We are unable to fulfill many of our obligations for reasons beyond our control. What is the situation, for example, with shipping petroleum products to Uzbekistan from the Chimkent Refinery? We try to keep on schedule, but Chimkent began operating at normal levels only in May. Before that there had been unbalanced relations with Russia, from which it gets the oil. We finally reached an agreement with Russia. We are shipping it oil from Mangizstau, and receiving Tyumen oil in Chimkent via the oil pipeline from Omsk and Pavlodar. And we are selling part of the oil to Fergana. The Fergana Refinery supplies us with transformer and turbine lubricants for our power stations. Again you have an interdependence. It is very important to maintain good relations with our partners. We are dependent in very many areas both on each other and within the country. Let me return to clearing-based deliveries and settlements for them. We agreed in an intergovernmental accord that Kazakhstan will pay for energy resources with tinplate and iron ore pellets. The products come from the Karaganda Metallurgical Plant. But Karaganda is dependent on Dzhambyl, whose hydroelectric station was idle for virtually the entire month of April. Uzbek gas is extremely important to us. We lease the Gazli-Chimkent gas pipeline, which runs through Uzbek territory. And the Uzbek side cannot do without the Poltoratskoye underground gas storage facility, in the vicinity of Chimkent. Its reserves guarantee vital services in Tashkent. And here the Uzbek side leases from us. We also have problems with operations. This used to be handled in Central Asia and Kazakhstan by Sredazgazprom [Central Asian Gas Industry Association]. Since the Soviet Union broke up, we have divided its facilities and equipment. We established the Kazakhgaz [Kazakh Gas] State Holding Company. The gas pipeline is operated by a subsidiary know as Dzhetisugaz. The gas pipeline is 312 kilometers long. Our specialists have experience in operating such installations, as we used to service the Bukhara-Ural gas pipeline and its compressor stations. But here we have dual responsibility. We have to ensure the gas pipeline's operation on foreign territory. Our lease agreements provide for mutual control and inspections. We undertook to deal with any accidents that might happen. But it is important to prevent them! Now we are running into the problem of rising water tables in the pipeline's vicinity. This problem has to be solved with the local Ministry of Water Resources, which has to raise the dams and lower the groundwater level. In general, the ties have remained strong at bottom level. All of us power- and gas-industry workers have worked together for many years. And today too we help each other whenever we can. We began producing fittings and oil-field equipment at converted enterprises in Ust-Kamenogorsk, Petropavlovsk, and Almaty, and we immediately informed our Uzbek colleagues. Partners in Pavlodar used to supply caustic soda. But last year, on account of environmental concerns, the enterprise was closed. And not only for us, but also for our neighbors. The situation is the same with lubricants, which no one in the region produces. For example, for 300-megawatt units. So we bought them abroad for energy workers throughout the region. Our outlook? The economy will get on its feet. And our task is to maintain our fuel and energy potential and expand it.
