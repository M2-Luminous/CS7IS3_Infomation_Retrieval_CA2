They undertake to stabilize the emission of greenhouse gases, but fail to call for a CO2/energy tax as a tool to reach that goal. The EC environment ministers did agree, however, that in five years' time no more than half of the packaging waste should end up on the garbage dump. By then at least one-quarter of the garbage should be recycled. The "UN Framework Agreement on Climate Change" was solemnly signed in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992. The signing parties committed themselves to stabilize the emission of gases causing the greenhouse effect. On a previous occasion, the EC member states had already agreed to stabilize this emission on the 1990 level by the year 2000. Several countries, including Belgium, had committed themselves to reduce the CO2 emission by the turn of the century. In a common statement, six member states (the Benelux countries, Germany, Denmark, and Italy) had opted for the implementation of a CO2/energy tax as a tool to meet their commitments. They had linked the ratification of the Rio Convention to a go-ahead for the European environment tax. Yesterday, this linkage was dropped after all. It was merely agreed that a whole range of additional tools must be created, and that the talks on the Commission's proposal regarding the implementation of a European CO2/energy tax must be concluded by the end of 1994. At present, some 40 countries have ratified the Rio climate convention. The treaty will become effective as soon as 50 countries have ratified it. The EC environment ministers also reached an agreement on the management of packaging waste. Five years after the directive has come into effect, the member states must valorize at least 50 and at the most 65 percent of their packaging waste. Between 25 and 40 percent of the latter must be recycled. Countries such as the Netherlands, Germany, and Denmark might aim at higher recycling criteria, providing they do not disturb the single market and do not jeopardize the directive's implementation in other EC member states. So Germany is no longer entitled to merely dump its waste in neighboring countries. The waste directive must now return to the European Parliament for a second reading, and must then be resubmitted to the ministers for approval.
