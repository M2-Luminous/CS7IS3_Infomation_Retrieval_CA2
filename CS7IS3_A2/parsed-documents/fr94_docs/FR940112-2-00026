FR940112-2-00026 FR940112-2-00020 [Docket Nos. RP94&hyph;92&hyph;000, TQ94&hyph;3&hyph;23&hyph;000 and TM94&hyph;5&hyph;23&hyph;000] Eastern Shore Natural Gas Co., Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff January 6, 1994. Take notice that Eastern Shore Natural Gas Company (Eastern Shore) tendered for filing on December 30, 1993 certain revised tariff sheets included in Appendix A to the filing (to be in effect for November and December, 1993 and January, 1994) and also submitted for filing are tariff sheets in Appendix B (regular scheduled quarterly PGA filing) proposed to be effective February 1, 1994. Eastern Shore states that the purpose of the instant filing is threefold: (1) To further modify the tracking provisions contained in Section 24 of the General Terms and Conditions of Eastern Shore's FERC Gas Tariff with respect to its CWS and CFSS rate schedules; (2) to track changes in Eastern Shore's pipeline suppliers' storage service rates; and (3) to reflect changes in Eastern Shore's commodity and demand sales rates. Eastern Shore states that it seeks to reduce its CD commodity and increase its demand sales rates by $0.1559 and $0.1129 per dt, respectively, as compared to those sales rates filed in Eastern Shore's Out-Of-Cycle filing in Docket Nos. TQ94&hyph;2&hyph;23&hyph;000 and TM94&hyph;4&hyph;23&hyph;000. Such reduction in the CD commodity sales rate and increase in the demand sales rate are due to (1) lower prices being paid to Eastern Shore's suppliers under its market responsive gas supply contracts and (2) an increase in demand-related costs from upstream suppliers due to a revision in their Gas Research Institute (GRI) Charge effective January 1, 1994. Eastern Shore states that copies of the filing have been served upon its jurisdictional customers and interested State Commissions. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 and Rule 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214). All such motions or protests shall be filed on or before January 13, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
