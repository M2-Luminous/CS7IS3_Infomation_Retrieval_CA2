Let us hope that the government makes skillful use of both opportunities. The government is tired and in a rut. It needs competent new ministers to manage during the year remaining before the Eduskunta elections. The Conservatives have wanted to change ministers for a long time, but the undertaking did not succeed in practice. The speaker's post will be vacated by Ilkka Suominen, who is moving to Alko [alcoholic beverage monopoly] in the nick of time. If the Conservatives name one of their ministers as the new speaker -- for example Riitta Uosukainen -- space will naturally be created in the government. During the government's term, four Center Party ministers have already been changed, but the Conservatives continue with their original makeup. Experience has not helped the Conservatives win victories in the government; it is high time to see if a personnel change will bring new vigor to their government group. It would pay the Conservatives, however, to consider carefully whom they change and to what post. It would be useless -- although there are attempts -- to move Ilkka Kanerva from the Labor Ministry a year before the Eduskunta election. The shift would look like desertion. One would wish that the Center Party, for its part, would realize that, on the threshold of important EU [European Union] negotiations affecting agriculture, it is time to implement a fundamental change in the intellectual and skill qualifications at the Ministry of Agriculture. The leadership of the ministry can only be assumed by someone who knows foreign languages and can operate smoothly in the world.
