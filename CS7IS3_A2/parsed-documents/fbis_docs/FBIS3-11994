Only four of the 24 articles passed the constitutionality test. The remainder were declared unconstitutional. The Court declared unconstitutional the article that fixed 8 May for the first round of presidential elections and 19 June for the runoff. The Court dismissed Law 84 of 1993. Therefore the old Electoral Code enters in force. The Court concluded that the 21 articles declared unconstitutional can only be adopted within a statutory law and not within a regular law. The Court struck down the regulations that fixed the electoral timetable and that blank votes should not be taken into account at the time of determining the electoral ratio. At the same time, the Court also struck down the regulations that exempt former congressmen from resubmitting their qualifications for election when they register as candidates for Congress. The Court's ruling took place in an atmosphere of heated debate that divided the Court into blocs of five and four justices respectively. The Court's majority indicated that Law 84 contradicts what is mandated in Article 152, Paragraph C. Specifically, this provision provides that the organization and the regulation of political parties and movements -- internal voting for mayor and governors, for example -- cannot be included within a regular Electoral Law. At the same time the Court left without legal force the prohibition on candidates and political parties engaging in publicity, giving interviews, or participating in media reporting 24 hours before and during the day on which elections are held. Through this, the Court revived the use of all kinds of mobile or audio propaganda, and the use of t-shirts, flags, hats, and similar items related to the elections. In the opinion of the majority of the justices, propaganda restrictions can only be fixed through a statutory law, not through a regular law. The Court also dismissed the norms that prohibit the media from conducting and publicizing polls or public opinion inquiries on political or electoral preferences. This was indicated by the Constitutional Court when it settled the appeal filed against the Electoral Law (Law 84 of 1993). The decision handed down yesterday is the result of a three-week study, at the end of which four justices dismissed the ruling when they decided that these electoral process regulations should be fixed through a statutory law, not through a regular law. The justices who abstained were Jorge Arango Mejia, Vladimiro Naranjo Mesa, Carlos Gaviria Diaz, and Jose Gregorio Hernandez. Meanwhile, Justices Hernando Herrera Vargara, Eduardo Cifuentes Munoz, Alejandro Martinez, Fabio Moron Diaz, and Antonio Barrera Carbonell supported the ruling. According to the plaintiffs, the Electoral Law establishes provisions that contradict the Constitution due to errors in procedures or nonobservation of formalities. In addition, electoral actions can only be regulated through a statutory law. As was said, the Court also concluded that blank votes should be taken into account. One justice said: "If this is not done, it would imply disregard for the voting process." The Court deemed that the blank votes allow gauging of trends for support or nonsupport of the proposals of the various candidates. With regard to regulations that exempt former congressmen from resubmitting their qualifications for election when they register, the Court said that these prerogatives not only impair citizens' equal rights but also impair the guarantee of election and being elected established in the Constitution. The ruling (Article 22) that makes possible the election as president or vice president of the Republic of senators and representatives without application of the qualifier that no one can be elected to more than one public corporation or post, suffered the same fate. In the Court's view, the provision contradicts Article 179 of the Constitution, according to which "no one can be elected to more than one public corporation or post, nor to a corporation and a post, if the respective period coincides in time, even if only partial." On Justices Eduardo Cifuentes and Hernando Herrera's positions, the Court supported provisions that authorize the government to adopt budgets for the 1994 elections.
