Russia's relations with the European Union [EU], the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and generally in the former Yugoslavia, and the problems between Athens and Skopje were discussed today at Zappion Palace during the talks between the EU troika and Russia. The talks were attended by Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, German Foreign Minister Kinkel, Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes, Hans van den Broek, EU Commissioner for Foreign Affairs, and Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev. Regarding this meeting, our diplomatic correspondent Mirella Kalostipi reports the following: [Begin Kalostipi recording] Foreign Minister Papoulias described the meeting between the EU troika and Russia as productive, sincere, and warm. Since this morning, the foreign ministers of Germany and Belgium, the EU commissioner for foreign affairs, and the Greek foreign minister, who is presiding over the EU Council of Foreign Ministers, have been meeting with the Russian foreign minister on all the important issues that Europe is facing. Naturally, the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina was at the center of the talks. Both Papoulias and Kozyrev expressed optimism that a peaceful solution to the problem will prevail over a military one. In a news conference immediately following the meeting, the foreign ministers of Germany and Russia were asked about the Greek measures against Skopje. Kinkel, as is known, opposed the measures, saying they are unusual and not a way to solve problems. He also expressed his country's interest in stability in the area. The Russian foreign minister stressed that the people in the south of Europe should contribute toward stability in the Balkans. If there are states with territorial plans against other countries, they should give them up and, like Russia, Kozyrev said, respect the sovereignty and independence of other peoples.
