Granic told the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva that negotiations were the only way to end the war and find a political settlement to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. However Granic, who is also deputy prime minister, made no reference to Wednesday's statement by ethnic Croatians in Bosnia that they were willing to consider a union with Bosnia's Muslims. Croatians and Muslims in Bosnia have agreed a cease-fire, which comes into effect at midday on Friday.
