Over the past decade, under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the CPC Central Military Commission and with the concern and support of local party committees, governments, and the masses at all levels, this unit has matured into an important armed force defending the socialist system and maintaining social stability. Comrade Jiang Zemin, as Party general secretary, State president, and chairman of the CPC Central Military Commission, is a very busy man and occupied with a myriad of state affairs but he is very much concerned about the building of the PAPF. Over the past few years, his footprints have extended across PAPF battalions in 28 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities throughout the country. He has encouraged vast numbers of PAPF officers and men to accomplish their mission and constantly make contributions to the motherland and the people. A Good Social Environment Is Essential for Economic Construction. General Secretary Jiang Urged: "The PAPF Should Stand in the Forefront of Maintaining Public Order and Social Stability." Whenever people step into the PAPF headquarters, the Triangle Building, the first things that come into view are the 16 glittering characters of: "Strengthening the Building of the PAPF, Defending the Socialist System" erected in the hall. This was the inscription made by General Secretary Jiang Zemin when he inspected the PAPF headquarters on 19 December 1990. Up to now, cadres of the PAPF Headquarters retain fresh in their memory the scenes of General Secretary Jiang's inspection. At 1515 on that day, General Secretary Jiang, accompanied by Qiao Shi, CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee member and secretary of the CPC Central Commission of Political Science and Law, went to the PAPF headquarters. He met cordially with cadres at and above the department level, conscientiously listened to work reports presented by leaders of the PAPF, and often chipped in with cheerful and humorous remarks. General Secretary Jiang analyzed the domestic and international situation and expounded on the nature, position, and role of the PAPF from the high plane of consolidating the socialist system. He said: "Our present socialist system has been built at the expense of the bloody sacrifices of tens of millions of revolutionary martyrs and we must definitely defend it. The PAPF is a component of the armed forces of our Party and our country. Its tasks are different from that of the People's Liberation Army [PLA], but both the PAPF and the PLA serve the people. The PAPF undertakes important tasks in defending the socialist system and maintaining social stability and we must definitely build it up well." Our hearts were filled with deep feelings and we have to shoulder heavy burdens. General Secretary Jiang placed high hopes on the PAPF in safeguarding socialist modernization. On the eve of the 1991 Spring Festival, General Secretary Jiang went to the headquarters of the Henan PAPF, cordially paid homage to officers and men, and said: "The Spring Festival is approaching. I am paying an early New Year call on all of you!" Then, he pointed out: "Our Party set out the proposal on the `Eighth Five-Year Plan' and the `10-Year Program' at the Seventh Plenary Session of the 13th Central Party Committee, which was recently held. Now, the whole country is studying and implementing it. However, there is a very important problem which is directly related to your tasks. It is impossible to accomplish our economic construction without a stable situation. Only under a stable political situation can we really devote our energies to promoting our economy. Viewed from the present international situation it is, by and large, favorable to us. Peace and development are still the two themes of the world but we should also watch out for the volatile international situation. We must always heighten our vigilance against some foreign forces which infiltrate our country and carry out subversive activities. We must resolutely nip in the bud every symptom which endangers social stability once we discover it. This is, in the first place, the duty of the PAPF. I hope that all of you always have high morale and exert yourselves in the struggle to create and maintain a good social environment for our country's economic construction." On 12 October 1992, General Secretary Jiang was delivering his report to the 14th CPC National Congress in the Great Hall of the People. "The PAPF is an important power in safeguarding our socialist modernization." The hearts of all armed police delegates to the 14th CPC National Congress were overflowing hearing this sonorous voice. Delegates said excitedly in the discussions: It is the first time that the PAPF has been mentioned in the report to the party congress. General Secretary Jiang has further defined the glorious mission of the PAPF during the new era of development of the socialist undertaking. General Secretary Jiang set forth the ideology of allowing the PAPF to stand in the forefront and fight in the van when dealing with emergencies and maintaining social stability in accordance with the peculiarities of the PAPF in performing its missions. On the night of 19 April 1991, General Secretary Jiang went to inspect Sichuan Province. After a discussion with the Sichuan Provincial CPC Committee and the provincial government, disregarding his tiredness after a day's work, he asked Lin Xianze and Li Kaiyuan, commander and deputy commander of the Sichuan Armed Police Corps, about the detailed public security situation in Sichuan. On the following morning, in drizzling rain, General Secretary Jiang went to the Sichuan Armed Police Corps Headquarters for an inspection. On the parade ground, while braving the rain, he met cadres from the headquarters and earnestly told everybody: "We must implement the basic party line unswervingly and devote our energies to accomplishing economic construction. However, it is impossible to accomplish economic construction without a stable and united social environment and there is no exception to this, in modern or ancient times in China or elsewhere. No country has ever accomplished economic construction under constantly chaotic circumstances. Only with social stability and unity can we have the preconditions to develop our economy. On what does stability and unity rely? It relies on correct policies, strong ideological and political work, skillful handling of the two different kinds of conflicts and, in the final analysis, it relies on economic development. The PAPF must stand in the frontline and fight in the van in safeguarding public security. Our PAPF must always be prepared for any destabilizing event and decisively nip it in the bud, thus ensuring a stable and unified situation. Comrade Jiang Zemin has expounded on many occasions since becoming general secretary, the ideology of allowing the PAPF to stand in the front line to maintain social stability. --On 3 July 1989, he talked about the task of further safeguarding social stability when meeting all the comrades who attended the National Public Security Department (Bureau) Heads Conference. He said: "I think under normal circumstances, we mainly rely on our public security personnel and our armed police." --On 28 September 1990, he emphatically pointed out when inspecting the Inner Mongolian Armed Police Corps: "As far as the task of maintaining social stability is concerned, those who stand in the forefront are the Armed Police." --On 19 September 1993, he further stressed when reviewing the PAPF's achievements in military training: "As far as the defense of state security and social stability is concerned, the ideology of marching to the forefront and fighting in the van must be firmly established in the PAPF." The ideology of "standing in the forefront" and "fighting in the van" has been kept firmly in the minds of armed police officers and men and has become their strong impetus in defending modernization. The PAPF Spreads All Over the Country and Is In Direct Contact With Society. General Secretary Jiang Stressed: "It Is Very Important To Vigorously Advocate and Carry Forward Our Army's Glorious Tradition." The PAPF has to undertake many tasks covering an extensive areas. Due to special tasks and the macroscopic social environment of reform and opening up, special requirements have been set on building the ideology and style in this force. An important matter which General Secretary Jiang often pays attention to is how to preserve the purity of the PAPF. In the small hours of a certain day in March 1991, General Secretary Jiang, who was inspecting Hunan, could not calm himself for a long time after reading a letter addressed from Mao Anying to his relative in October 1949. The following day, General Secretary Jiang addressed a meeting attended by PLA and PAPF cadres, at and above the division level, stationed in Changsha City. He said with deep feelings: "A relative of Mao Anying wrote him a letter hoping that Chairman Mao could assign a government post to another relative of Mao Anying. In his letter of reply Mao Anying stated his views. The main points were that the fundamental difference distinguishing the New China from the old, the Communist Party from the Kuomintang, and Mao Zedong from Chiang Kai-shek, lay in the virtue of not seeking personal gain. Today, this letter is still worthy of our study. If vast numbers of our Party members and cadres can serve the interests of the majority and refrain from seeking personal gain, just as the revolutionary martyrs did, our party style will be improved and our Party will become stronger. We must frequently teach vast numbers of cadres and soldiers to carry forward the fine tradition, cultivate patriotic thinking and communist values and outlook on life, and serve the people wholeheartedly." In the autumn of 1991, General Secretary Jiang went to Xibaipo to "reflect on the past in light of the present" and all sorts of feelings welled up his mind. When addressing the police from Hebei Provincial Public Security Department and cadres from Hebei Provincial Armed Police Corps, he said: "A visit to Xibaipo is a very good education for all of us. Xibaipo was once the seat of the Central Party Committee and the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh CPC Central Committee was held there. At the party plenary session, Chairman Mao urged that we must be modest and prudent and guard against arrogance and rashness and that we must keep to the style of hard struggle and plain living. In this respect, how well are we now? This is the question which all of us should ponder." In January 1992, as No.10 Detachment of the Shanghai Armed Police Corps launched activities to mark the 10th anniversary of "emulating the Good No. 8 Company on Nanjing Road," General Secretary Jiang went there on an inspection. While attentively viewing silk banners and certificates of merit in the detachment's honorary room he could not help saying: "We must be willing to act as orderlies who are untainted with unhealthy practices and this is a tradition which we must carry forward!" General Secretary Jiang also wrote an inscription for the No. 10 Detachment: "The new generation under neon lights must emulate the Good No. 8 Company on Nanjing Road, to encourage officers and men to learn from the `Good No. 8 Company,' to carry forward the glorious tradition of never being tainted with corrupt practices and constantly make new contributions to safeguarding Shanghai's reform, opening up, and modernization. One morning in the early summer of 1993, the West Room in the Great Hall of the People was ablaze with lights. General Secretary Jiang Zemin, accompanied by Liu Huaqing, Zhang Zhen, Ren Jianxin, Luo Gan, and other cadres, listened to reports on the PAPF work situation by Commander Ba Zhongtan and Political Commissar Zhang Shutian. Afterwards, he emphatically told members of the PAPF party committee: "Our PAPF is spread all over the country, including Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and other more prosperous localities. In strengthening the building of the force, particularly in the work of building our ideology and style, we are faced with an environment of constantly deepening reform and wider opening up. It is very important to take the new reality and new tasks into consideration and vigorously advocate and carry forward our Army's glorious tradition. The PLA's Good No. 8 Company on Nanjing Road always maintained its distinctive revolutionary character amidst an atmosphere of debauchery, which was very remarkable. There is always the question of guarding against degeneration in army building in times of peace, and we must never be tainted with corrupt practices. The PAPF is the same in this respect. The PAPF is in direct contact with society, in particular, some of the units live in some prosperous and open cities and are faced with scenes of debauchery. Therefore, it is necessary to teach and encourage officers and men to stand the test and maintain a high morale." These remarks, which were full of deep feelings, inspired vast numbers of armed police officers and men to inherit the glorious tradition of our Party and Army, carry forward the "five revolutionary spirits" advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, maintain the true qualities of the people's army, and portray a good image of people's guards. The Sacred Mission of Maintaining Social Stability Sets a Very High Demand on the PAPF's Building. General Secretary Jiang Pointed Out: "The PAPF Must Pay Attention to Its Software and Hardware and Constantly Improve the Capability To Perform Its Duties and To Handle Emergencies." On 19 September 1993, during the autumn harvest, General Secretary Jiang went to the PAPF Special Police Academy in the suburbs of Beijing to review PAPF achievements in military training. Following a number of brilliant performances and bursts of warm applause, he cheerfully stood up to wave greetings to officers and men and commended them: "Your reports gave expression to your superb and competent military technique, your valiant and tenacious fighting style, and the mental attitude of staunch guards. The comprehensive building of the PAPF is being constantly strengthened and new progress in all kinds of work is being constantly achieved, the Central Party Committee is satisfied." After fully affirming the building and work of the PAPF, General Secretary Jiang set overall demands on how to further strengthen the PAPF's building. He made a call to armed police officers and men: It is necessary to uphold steadfastly our Party's absolute leadership of the Army; resolutely comply with the command of the Central Party Committee and the Central Military Commission; firmly implement instructions issued by the Central Party Committee the State Council, and the Central Military Commission; and steadfastly implement the basic party line. It is necessary to conscientiously study Mao Zedong's military thought and Deng Xiaoping's thinking on military building during the new period; resolutely implement PLA regulations; and uphold the principle of improving the quality of army building. It is necessary to place education in a strategic position and integrate it with the reality of the PAPF to go in for rigorous training, set stricter demands, and enforce stricter controls. It is necessary to improve weaponry; enhance military and political quality; and improve the capability to perform our duties and handle emergencies under modern conditions. It is necessary to inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of our Party and Army; strive to develop the PAPF into a dauntless unit which is "qualified politically and competent militarily" and which "has a fine style of work, adheres to strict discipline, and is ensured of adequate maintenance and supplies"; and conscientiously perform the sacred mission of maintaining state security and social stability! General Secretary Jiang not only portrayed the magnificent blueprint of the PAPF's building but also set concrete demands on it. He used engineering terminology, in light of the new domestic and international situation and the PAPF's characteristics, to liken the PAPF's equipment to "hardware" and to equate the military and political quality of officers and men to "software." He stated unequivocally: "The PAPF must pay attention to both the software and hardware and constantly improve the capability to perform your duties and to handle emergencies." On the afternoon of 2 August 1989, a meeting was called commending public security personnel and the Shanghai PAPF. General Secretary Jiang specially canceled his schedule and cheerfully attended the meeting to extend his greetings. He also gave important instructions on the building of public security and the PAPF. He pointed out: "As an instrument of the people's democratic dictatorship, public security and the PAPF must be armed with goods and materials as well as vigor. The latter means that we must be armed with Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, always maintain political alertness, and have a high degree of consciousness." In the early summer of 1993, the new situation in the development of the socialist market economy brought new vitality to the PAPF and also posed new problems, one after another, to the building of the force. In order to enable officers and men to adapt to the new situation, General Secretary Jiang promptly issued a call to the force to study more. He stressed when meeting members of the PAPF party committee at the Great Hall of the People that, in the process of developing a socialist market economy, we must constantly learn new knowledge and that his was also very important to strengthening the building of the force. He said: "Under the new situation, our leaders at all levels must strive to learn new knowledge and new things. We are now engaging in a socialist market economy but what exactly is the market, the market mechanism, and the socialist market economy? Many comrades do not have, or are short of, basic knowledge in this field. Hence, we must study it well and should study it repeatedly. We must study scientific and technological knowledge through various channels to advance our cultural quality to a new stage. Our cultural quality covers every aspect, including the quality of economic knowledge, of scientific and technological knowledge, and of military knowledge. The PAPF must attach importance to improving its military, scientific, and technological quality. In the first place, it must improve the military and scientific and technological quality of leading armed police cadres at all levels, particularly that of senior cadres. Only when this has been done can the force become really combat- ready." In order to help fully improve the PAPF military and political quality and make its "software" and "hardware" competent, General Secretary Jiang personally inspected the PAPF Training Ground despite many claims on his time. On the morning of 30 July 1991, it was scorching hot in Tianjin Municipality. General Secretary Jiang, who was there on an inspection, went to the Tianjin Armed Police Corps No. 6 Detachment Training Ground and braved the intense heat of summer to watch in the open the report-back performance of military training. After watching such brilliant performances as emergency dispatch, tactics of using batons and shields, and the formation of anti-riot squads, he said cheerfully: "This kind of competency is what we should have, especially in large cities. In case emergencies arise, we can immediately dispatch the armed police to nip them in the bud." On 4 May 1992, a get-together was held at the Great Hall of the People to mark the 70th anniversary of the Communist Youth League's founding and General Secretary Jiang, who attended, was impressed by the unique skills demonstrateded by the armed policemen. Full of zest, he talked to the performers from the Special Police Academy and repeatedly praised them on their extraordinary skills. It has never been easy to strengthen the building of PAPF "hardware" and party and government leaders and the departments of politics and law at all levels must support and attach importance to it. Hence, on many occasions, General Secretary Jiang has told leading comrades in provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities that we must attach importance to building the PAPF "hardware." We should spare no expense in properly arming the armed police. In compliance with General Secretary Jiang's instructions, party committees and governments in various localities have: Paid great attention to building the PAPF; given strong support to them in terms of finance and goods and materials; set up a number of regular barracks; and have installed groups of excellent cavalry. Living up to our Party's and the people's concern and expectations, the PAPF have made arduous efforts to strengthen the building of "software" and "hardware" and constantly improve its combat strength. As a result, a number of heroic collectives which are ready to assemble at the first call and capable of fighting and winning, such as the "special police of Lingnan," the "iron fist of Nankai," and the "keen sword of Cangshan," have emerged. Soldiers Are the Basis of the Force. General Secretary Jiang Hoped That the "Relationship Between Officers and Men and Between Comrades Should be Even Closer Than the Relationship Between Family Members." The Shanghai Armed Police Corps No. 10 Detachment will never forget 18 January 1992. On that day, General Secretary Jiang visited them and went straight to the dormitory of the Class No. 2. He touched the soldiers' quilts and asked: "Are you feeling cold?" On learning that every soldier was given a quilt, a woolen blanket, and an overcoat, he smiled and said to the soldiers: "You have three layers of warmth." Everybody present laughed. General Secretary Jiang asked about soldiers' cultural and recreational activities. He told leaders of the corps by his side: "Soldiers' cultural and recreational activities must be organized well." General Secretary Jiang also inspected the kitchen and asked in detail about the varieties and nutritious value of the meals. General Secretary Jiang urged leaders of the PAPF at all levels to inherit and carry forward the fine tradition initiated by Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, and revolutionaries of the older generation and pay great attention to the building of the force by maintaining close ties between officers and men. On 17 May 1990, General Secretary Jiang met cadres from the Hainan Armed Police Corps and PLA stationed in Hainan at and above the division level. He urged all of them to fully understand the importance of unity between officers and men from the high plane of the nature of the People's Army. He said sincerely: "Our Army is a proletarian force and the people's own army. Unity between officers and men and support given to soldiers has always been the fine tradition of our Army. Why do the broad masses support the revolution and the Army and send their children to the Army? It is precisely because our Army fights and works for the people's interests and, for this same reason, the relationship between officers and men and between comrades is even closer than the relationship between family members." To counter some of the relationship problems between officers and men in a small number of units, General Secretary Jiang twice urged party committees and leaders at all levels to pay attention to solving these problems in grass-roots units. He said: "The fact that some problems have arisen in the relationship between officers and men shows that we have not been painstaking enough in doing our ideological work and we do not have adequate understanding of soldiers' ideological trends. Something happens but we often do not know the reason why and muddle through. How can we act like this? In the past, company commanders and political instructors would watch every night which soldiers tossed about in bed or which soldiers suddenly ate less than they normally did. In these cases, company commanders and political instructors would try to understand whether or not the soldiers had ideological problems or whether or not their families had any problems. Such a fine tradition of doing painstaking ideological work can never be cast away! It is very important to be solicitous about soldiers' health, understand their mental state, be concerned about their weal and woe, and solve their problems." As general secretary of our Party, state president, and chairman of the Central Military Commission, Comrade Jiang Zemin is extremely busy but he is always concerned about the PAPF building and spares time to visit armed police officers and men to talk to them meticulously. His conduct sets an example to leaders at all levels. On 13 October 1989, General Secretary Jiang inspected work in Jiangxi. Around noon on that day, after finishing his work, he had photos taken with leading comrades of the provincial party committee and working personnel. At 0900 the following day, after learning that six soldier guards who had been on duty and had not had their photos taken with him, General Secretary Jiang Zemin joyfully agreed to have one more photo taken. When he saw that the six soldier guards stood behind him in a reserved manner, he moved a step backward and cordially said: "It is better to stand alongside to take a photo." Then, the general secretary stood in the midst of the soldiers and the photo was taken. On the morning of 13 November 1991, in the cold wind of the early winter, General Secretary Jiang and other leading comrades from the Central Party Committee went to a construction site at Liangshuihe, Beijing, to participate in the work. Red flags fluttered over the construction site, which was seething with excitement. At 0955, General Secretary Jiang went to an armed police construction site and extended cordial greetings to the officers and men. After learning from leaders of Beijing Municipality that due to inadequate machinery, the officers and men had borne many hardships and made great contributions to flood control projects, he repeatedly praised them saying: "Great, great!" The general secretary's commendation was like a warm current which boosted the strength of thousands of armed police officers and men to surmount difficulties and which inspired everybody to fulfill his task while ensuring quality. Cordial care is a tremendous driving force. Living up to the expectations of General Secretary Jiang and the Central Party Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, armed police officers and men have: Satisfactorily completed the task of guarding against and dealing with emergencies; guaranteed the safety of fixed targets and targets of temporary service; achieved remarkable results in rushing to deal with emergencies and in providing disaster relief; and the have played an important role in the comprehensive management of public security, thus making contributions to safeguarding socialist modernization.
