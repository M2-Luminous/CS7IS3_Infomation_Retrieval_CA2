The row came to a head when a televised press conference on polling patterns of the day was ended before journalists had completed their questioning. The questions, focusing on the failure of polling stations because of material shortages, became sharper when IEC spokesman Mr Kumi Naidoo failed to provide statistics and specific answers. Questioners repeatedly said the legalistic jargon in which answers were couched did not relate to information continuously received by them. Mr Naidoo said the IEC was loath to bind itself to specifics before it had verified the data available to it. When the conference was halted at the end of the televised slot, journalists objected and demanded that all their questions be answered. IEC officials insisted, however, that a further press conference would follow in an hour and the questions could then be asked.
