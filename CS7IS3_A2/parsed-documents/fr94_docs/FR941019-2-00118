FR941019-2-00118 FR941019-2-00080 Violations of the Sherman Act may be prosecuted as civil or criminal offenses. Conduct that the Department prosecutes criminally is limited to traditional per se offenses of the law, which typically involve price-fixing, customer allocation, bid-rigging or other cartel activities that would also be violations of the law in many countries. Criminal violations of the Act are punishable by fines and imprisonment. The Sherman Act provides that corporate defendants may be fined up to $10 million, other defendants may be fined up to $350,000, and individuals may be sentenced to up to 3 years' imprisonment. 4 The Department has sole responsibility for the criminal enforcement of the Sherman Act. In a civil proceeding, the Department may obtain injunctive relief against prohibited practices. It may also obtain treble damages if the U.S. government is the purchaser of affected goods or services. 5 Private plaintiffs may also obtain injunctive and treble damage relief for violations of the Sherman Act. Before the Commission conduct that violates the Sherman Act may be challenged pursuant to the Commission's power under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, described below. 4 Defendants may be fined up to twice the gross pecuniary gain or loss caused by their offense in lieu of the Sherman Act fines, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §3571(d) (1988 & Supp. 1993). In addition, the U.S. Sentencing Commission Guidelines provide further information about possible criminal sanctions for individual antitrust defendants in §2R1.1 and for organizational defendants in Chapter Eight. 5 See 15 U.S.C. §4 (1988) (injunctive relief); 15 U.S.C. §15a (1988 & Supp. 1993) (damages). 2.2␣Clayton Act The Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. §12 et seq., expands on the general prohibitions of the Sherman Act and addresses anticompetitive problems in their incipiency. 6 Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. §18, prohibits any merger or acquisition of stock or assets ``where in any line of commerce or in any activity affecting commerce in any section of the country, the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.'' 7 Section 15 of the Clayton Act empowers the Attorney General, and Section 13(b) of the FTC Act empowers the Commission, to seek a court order enjoining consummation of a merger that would violate Section 7. In addition, the Commission may seek a cease and desist order in an administrative proceeding against a merger under either Section 11 of the Clayton Act or Section 5 of the FTC Act, or both. Private parties may also seek injunctive relief under 15 U.S.C. §26. 6 Under the Clayton Act, ``commerce'' includes ``trade or commerce among the several states and with foreign nations*␣*␣*.'' ``Persons'' include corporations or associations existing under or authorized either by the laws of the United States or any of its states or territories, or by the laws of any foreign country. 15 U.S.C. §12 (1988 & Supp. 1993). 7 15 U.S.C. §18 (1988). The asset acquisition clause applies to ``person[s] subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission'' under the Clayton Act. Section 3 of the Clayton Act prohibits any person engaged in commerce from conditioning the lease or sale of goods or commodities upon the purchaser's agreement not to use the products of a competitor, if the effect may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce. 8 In evaluating transactions, the trend of recent authority is to use the same analysis employed in the evaluation of tying under Sherman Act Section 1 to assess a defendant's liability under Section 3 of the Clayton Act. 9 8 15 U.S.C. §14 (1988). 9 See, e.g., Mozart Co. v. Mercedes-Benz of N. Am., Inc., 833 F.2d 1342, 1352 (9th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 870 (1988).
