Your life is priceless and your initiative is fine to build the nation and country toward prosperity in all fields, especially to achieve national reconciliation and reinforce peace and political stability for the beloved Cambodian motherland. On behalf of the RGC, we pledge to pursue your advice and are determined to sacrifice all our physical and moral efforts to following Your Majesty in building the Kingdom of Cambodia toward prosperity. Moreover, on behalf of the RGC and the Cambodian people of all strata, we pray that the Triple Jewels and all sacred things the world over, such as charisma of previous Cambodian kings and goddesses protecting the royal parasol, protect Your Majesty. May you enjoy the five blessings of Lord Buddha; that is, longevity, social prestige, happiness, strength, and enlightenment. Especially, may you recover quickly from your illness and have a long life so you can return and stay as the support for your beloved children and carry on your noble mission of leading the Cambodian motherland toward security, peace, and social progress.
