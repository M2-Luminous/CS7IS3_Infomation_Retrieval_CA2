This faction of the church incluudes bishops such as Tomas Balduino, of Goias Velho; Pedro Casaldaliga, from Araguaia in Mato Grosso State; Augusto Rocha, of Picos in Piaui State; and Friar Leonardo Boff and Friar Betto. During Lula's debate, which was held today within the framework of his electoral campaign, Friar Betto reported on the national pro-Lula day celebration. He said that the day will be celebrated in various forms, and in the largest possible number of parishes countrywide. He added: "There could be prayers, rosaries, marches, liturgical celebrations, and masses supporting Lula's candidacy." Lula met Brasilia and Goias State representatives of the Catholic Church. Friar Betto said that as the Brazilian Catholic Church has decided to give preferential attention to the problems of the destitute Brazilians, it is clear that it must support someone like Lula. He said: "To support the election of a worker who was born poor is consistent with giving preferential attention to the problems of the most destitute people." The Catholic Church will celebrate the pro-Lula day on 7 September, on the anniversary of Brazilian independence.
