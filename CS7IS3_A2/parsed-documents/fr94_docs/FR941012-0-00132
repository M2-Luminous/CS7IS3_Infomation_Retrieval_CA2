FR941012-0-00132 FR941012-0-00011 Second, in the final rule OSHA has addressed the concerns of other commenters by allowing work to commence within two tree lengths of a marked danger tree, provided that the employer demonstrates that a shorter distance will not create a hazard for an employee. This change will assure the safety of logging employees without removing significant timber from production. OSHA notes that the employer bears the burden of demonstrating that a distance of less than two tree lengths will not create a hazard for an employee. Supervisors should actively participate in identifying and training employees about providing safe distances. Whether a shorter distance does create a hazard is a case-by-case determination. What constitutes a safe distance for other work to be conducted will require an evaluation of various factors such as, but not limited to, the size of the danger tree, how secure it is, its condition, the slope of the work area, and the presence of other employees in the area. For example, excessive root deterioration or damage might indicate that the danger tree is unstable and that there is a possibility it could fall. In such case, a two tree-length distance would be required. Some commenters recommended that OSHA designate dislodging a tree by felling another one into it as a safe technique ``in certain situations'' (Ex. 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). However, these commenters did not identify any situations in which it would be safe to dislodge a tree in this manner. There is no information in the record that identifies any situation in which it is safe to use domino felling to fell a danger tree. In fact, other commenters have indicated they know of no situation when felling another tree into a danger tree is considered safe practice (Ex. 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;46). OSHA also believes that it is not safe to dislodge a tree in this manner. First, there are already hazards associated with domino felling trees that are not danger trees. Trying to domino fell danger trees such as lodged trees can only increase the seriousness of the hazard. One of the factors that makes a tree a danger tree is that the physical damage to the tree may cause it to fall in an unintended direction. Felling another tree into the danger tree increases the potential for a misdirected fall. Second, the possibility exists that danger trees being domino felled also will become lodged, thereby increasing the number of trees to be avoided or removed and, consequently, increasing the risk to employees when those lodged trees are removed. The safest way to remove a lodged tree, first is remove all unnecessary employees from the area and then to hook the tree to a skidder, and pull the tree down (Ex. 5&hyph;43). Therefore, OSHA is not permitting removal of any tree, including a danger tree, by domino felling (See discussion of paragraph (h)(1)(ix). Paragraph (h)(1)(vii) of the final rule requires that each danger tree be carefully checked for signs of loose bark, broken branches and limbs or other damage before it is felled or removed. This provision also requires that loose bark and other damage that may create a hazard be removed before felling or removing the tree. This requirement has been adopted from the proposed rule. In the proposed rule, OSHA specified that snags be carefully checked for dangerous bark before they are felled and that accessible loose bark be removed before felling. One commenter opposed this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;65). This commenter said that removing loose bark increases dangers from above since upper bark will slough off if lower bark is no longer supporting it. As such, this commenter recommended that OSHA require loose bark to be pinned to the tree. OSHA has changed the final rule to include removing loose bark or holding it in place.
