The topics include Palestinian passports and postal stamps, the size of the Palestinian police force, and the area of Jericho to enjoy self-rule under the agreement. The same sources added that the Israelis refuse to take any step that may give the self-rule areas the form of a state, such as the issuing of passports and postal stamps. PLO sources have noted that Israeli troops have begun to withdraw from some sites in Gaza and Jericho in preparation for the final withdrawal from the two regions. Five Palestinian police officers have arrived in Gaza and Jericho to discuss how the Palestinian police force will be deployed once the Israeli withdrawal is finalized.
