Escobar Franco and Jorge Caceres] [Text] Coronel Oviedo -- After almost three hours of negotiations between peasant leaders and President Juan Carlos Wasmosy, there are no prospects for finding a solution to the social demands since the two parties did not reach concrete agreements. President Wasmosy accused Deputy Hermes Chamorro of being a "communist" during the meeting held in the Coronel Oviedo departmental Government House on 22 February. Wasmosy made the accusation when Deputy Chamorro demanded that exporters of agricultural products like him (Wasmosy) give up a minimum part of their profits in favor of the peasants to find a solution to the conflict. Chamorro said this request caused an immediate reaction by the president, who accused Chamorro of taking a position typical of populists and that he was revealing his ideological inclination toward communism. Chamorro replied that the accusation of being a communist is completely irresponsible and absurd, thus playing down the accusation. Chamorro came with the peasant leaders to meet Wasmosy, who was accompanied by Ministers Raul Torres [agriculture], Carlos Podesta [interior], Nicanor Duarte Frutos [education], and Candido Nunez Leon [health]. Chamorro said: "I made the request because I know there are exporters of agricultural products who advocate an increase in the price of cotton but Cadelpa [Paraguayan Cotton Chamber] is exerting tremendous pressure on its members to keep their prices at the same level." Chamorro added that Wasmosy supposedly advocates free competition but in practice, "when they have to put that principle, that philosophy, in practice they get together and make decisions by a majority. The president is part of that clique running the cotton business. Only someone who is blind cannot see the peasants' painful situation." Rafael Ruiz Diaz, peasant leader in the Simon Bolivar district, said the peasants came out of the meeting with Wasmosy disappointed because no agreement was reached and they only received promises. Ruiz Diaz said the president practically indicated that this case is not in his hands, but he will try to find a solution. Ruiz Diaz added that this was not the answer they expected. Ruiz Diaz also said, in Guarani: "He clearly told us that the government has enough force to prevent road closures and to take other measures of force. But we, the peasants, are ready to face the government if necessary." He said Wasmosy told them they can sell their cotton freely but that the Brazilian buyers, in this case, will have to pay the appropriate taxes at the border to take the product. He revealed that the peasants want [words indistinct] guaranies per kilogram of cotton, the release of the San Pedro peasants under arrest, the distribution of land, and guarantees for the land's exploitation. Regarding the peasants under arrest, they received the promise they would be released next week. Ruiz Diaz said Wasmosy told them that "if we resort to force, the peasants do not have a chance." Ruiz Diaz then said, in Guarani: "As Paraguayans and peasants, no one will run away from anyone. There is no such thing as being afraid of each other." He reiterated that the peasants will not give in to their demands and the peasants have more than enough energy. He said [in Guarani]: "There is no such thing as being afraid of each other."
