FR940412-2-00143 FR940412-2-00100 (4) Interest Rate: Alternatives of fixed and variable rates are requested. (a) Fixed Interest Rate: If rates are to be quoted based on a spread over an index, the lender should use as its index a long bond, specifically the 61/4% U.S. Treasury Bond due August 15, 2023. Such rate is to be set at the time of acceptance. (b) Variable Interest Rate: To be based on the six-month British Bankers Association LIBOR, preferably with terms relating to Borrower's right to convert to fixed. The rate should be adjusted weekly. (5) Prepayment: (a) Offers should include any options for prepayment and mention prepayment premiums, if any. (b) Only in an extraordinary event to assure compliance with statutes binding USAID, USAID reserves that right to accelerate the loan (it should be noted that since the inception of the USAID Housing Guaranty Program in 1962, USAID has not exercised its right of acceleration). (6) Fees: Offers should specify the placement fees and other expenses, including USAID fees and Paying and Transfer Agent fees. Lenders are requested to include all legal fees and out-of-pocket expenses in their placement fee. Such fees and expenses shall be payable at closing from the proceeds of the loan. All fees should be clearly specified in the offer. (7) Closing Date: Not to exceed 60 days from date of selection of lender. Selection of investment bankers and/or lenders and the terms of the loan are initially subject to the individual discretion of the borrower, and thereafter, subject to certain conditions required of the Borrower by USAID as set forth in agreements between USAID and the Borrower. The full repayment of the loans will be guaranteed by USAID. The USAID guaranty will be backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America and will be issued pursuant to authority in section 222 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (the ``Act''). Lenders eligible to receive the USAID guaranty are those specified in section 238(c) of the Act. They are: (1) U.S. citizens; (2) domestic U.S. corporations, partnerships, or associations substantially beneficially owned by U.S. citizens; (3) foreign corporations whose share capital is at least 95 percent owned by U.S. citizens; and, (4) foreign partnerships or associations wholly owned by U.S. citizens. To be eligible for the USAID guaranty, the loans must be repayable in full no later than the thirtieth anniversary of the disbursement of the principal amount thereof and the interest rates may be no higher than the maximum rate established from time to time by USAID.
