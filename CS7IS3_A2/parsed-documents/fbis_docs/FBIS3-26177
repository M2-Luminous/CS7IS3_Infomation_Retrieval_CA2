Wu Jianmin, the spokesman, reiterated the official stand of the Chinese Government at a weekly press conference here this afternoon. When asked to comment on a report that the Taiwan authorities have sent officials on a secret visit to Hong Kong and Macao to hold consultations with the Hong Kong and Macao Governments on matters concerning air services, he said that air routes between Taiwan and Hong Kong and between Taiwan and Macao are those between three places with China's territory. Prior to 1997 and 1999, Britain and Portugal are responsible for the administration of Hong Kong and Macao respectively, Wu said. During the transitional period, he added, if an airliner of Hong Kong or Macao wishes to enter into a non-governmental arrangement straddling 1997 or 1999 with an airliner of Taiwan on air services between them, the British side or the Portuguese side should consult the Chinese Government in advance.
