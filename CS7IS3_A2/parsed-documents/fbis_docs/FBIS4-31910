"The agreement on close cooperation and coalition between Egyutteles and the MKDH is ready to 95 percent. We only could not reach consensus on whether or not the coalition should be open for other political groupings," Egyutteles Chairman Miklos Duray told CTK today. Egyutteles has 9 and the MKDH 5 deputies in the 150-seat Slovak Parliament. Duray pointed out that on Monday [13 June] his movement had acceded to the MKDH demand that a twin-coalition be established before launching negotiations with the non-parliamentary Hungarian Civic Party (MOS) and the Hungarian People's Party (MLS). However, given electoral law provisions on electoral thresholds, only an offer of a triple coalition or participation of the two remaining ethnic Hungarian parties in a common list of candidates can be considered, Duray said. "We (Egyutteles and the MKDH) will conclude a double coalition and then jointly discuss the conditions to be set for other partners," he added. Duray pointed out that according to the prepared coalition agreement, the placing of contenders for deputies' posts (on the common lists of candidates) was to be decided by lots. "If the lot provides for a MKDH candidate to place first, an Egyutteles candidate would follow second," he explained. He said that the two movements had also decided to divide up their costs "equally". The state subsidy which the coalition will receive for votes gained in the autumn elections will be, Duray said, divided up "partly equally and partly according to the number of seats acquired in parliament." "In its program the Egyutteles movement is also open to left-wing non-communist forces," Duray said. However, he admitted that the ethnic Hungarian coalition found itself "to the right from the center" in the political spectrum.
