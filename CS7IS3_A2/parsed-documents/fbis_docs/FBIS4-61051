[passage omitted] In the opinion of the Russian minister, questions on the practical transition to a peaceful life, on setting up economic ties, and guaranteeing security are of exceptional importance for the whole region. It is gratifying that Russia also has made its contribution to the achievement of progress along this path. In particular, "it is generally acknowledged" that the recent visits to Moscow by the PLO and Israeli delegations, the meetings which Yasir 'Arafat and Yitzhaq Rabin had with Boris Yeltsin "gave a good boost to the work being carried out," A.Kozyrev noted. He also voiced satisfaction with the constructive cooperation which is under way with the U.S. side. "We are are in daily contact, we are acting in unison, in complete accord," the minister stressed. A. Kozyrev expressed confidence that the present first step in the Near East peace process should be accompanied by the search for mutually acceptable solutions with regard to all Palestinian territories and by progress in other areas of the talks. The minister believes that it is necessary, first and foremost, to attain progress in the Israel-Syrian area of the talks, as the most difficult one. In his words, Russia has an opportunity to play an active mediatory role. Touching upon Russia's idea of convening the second Madrid conference on the Near East, A. Kozyrev noted that it aimed to open new "political-diplomatic" prospects and that it is still topical, of course. "I think," he continued, "that this idea will receive a wider recognition since a certain stage in the current process is now coming to completion." It is necessary to assess the path which has been traveled and to specifically outline future areas of the talks to capitalize on the achievements of the first Madrid conference. In the opinion of the Russian minister, the present peace process could become a model for resolving many "chronic conflicts fraught with bloodshed and intolerance." This applies in particular, he noted, to the Karabakh conflict. A.Kozyrev voiced the hope that the warring sides will be able to reach agreement on a cease-fire and to "enter an agreement drawn up with Russian mediation." The head of the foreign policy department of the Russian Federation noted that the Interparliamentary Assembly of CIS states could make a weighty contribution to resolving this problem. "We will also strive to step up cooperation in this direction in the CSCE," he said. The minister also said that he intended to meet soon with Jan Eliasson, chairman of the CSCE peace conference on Nagorno-Karabakh.
