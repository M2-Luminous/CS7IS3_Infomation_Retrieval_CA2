FR940126-1-00004 FR940126-1-00002 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Parts 72 and 73 [FRL&hyph;4829&hyph;1] Acid Rain Program: Permits and Allowance System Proposed Regulations; Change in Public Comment Period for the Proposed Revisions to the Rules AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rules; change in public comment period. SUMMARY: On November 18, 1993, EPA published proposed regulations revising 40 CFR parts 72 and 73, the Permits and Allowance System rules of the Acid Rain Program. The original comment period for the proposal was to have ended January 3, 1994. By notice published on December 30, 1993, EPA extended the public comment period to end on January 19, 1994. In response to requests from interested parties, EPA is again extending the public comment period, which will end on February 10, 1994. In addition to the questions set forth in the November 18, 1993 notice of proposed rulemaking, EPA is requesting that commenters address whether and, if so, under what circumstances allowances allocated by EPA to substitution or compensating units under the January 11, 1993 regulations would be given back to EPA at some future date. DATES: Notice is hereby given that comments on the proposed revisions to the Permits and Allowance System rules published November 18, 1993 in the Federal Register (58 FR 60649&hyph;60968) must be submitted in writing and in duplicate to EPA by February 10, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send comments to EPA Air Docket Section (LE&hyph;131), Attention: Docket No. A&hyph;93&hyph;40, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. Comments received on this proposal will be available for reviewing and copying from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding Federal holidays, in room M&hyph;1500, Waterside Mall, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: The Acid Rain Hotline at (202) 233&hyph;9620 or Dwight C. Alpern, Attorney-advisor, at (202) 233&hyph;9151, Acid Rain Division (6204J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the November 18, 1993 notice of proposed rulemaking, EPA requested comment on whether certain substitution plans and reduced utilization plans with compensating units should be approved, and allowances allocated to approved substitution and compensating units, for 1995 under the January 11, 1993 regulations and whether action on these compliance options for 1996&hyph;99 should be deferred pending completion of the instant rulemaking proceeding. Comment was also requested concerning whether approval of these compliance options should be for some shorter or longer period, with action on them for the remaining portion of Phase I being deferred. In extending the public comment on this and other requests for comment set forth in the November 18, 1993 proposal, EPA notes that interested parties have requested that the Agency seek additional comment concerning whether any allowances allocated by EPA to substitution or compensating units under the January 11, 1993 regulations should be returned to EPA at some future time. Consequently, EPA requests such comment. If commenters maintain that a return of allowances should be required, the commenters should discuss what should be the period during which allowances may be retained (e.g., how many years) and when that period should begin. For example, the allowances could be allocated to a unit's Allowance Tracking System account for one or more years in Phase I and at the same time an equivalent number of allowances could be deducted from the Allowance Tracking System account for one or more future years. As an alternative, the deduction from the account for one or more future years could be made as the allowances are used or transferred. Dated: January 19, 1994. Carol M. Browner, Administrator, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;1624 Filed 1&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;M
