Karadzic had two-hour talks with special Russian envoy for former Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin in Pale today. Following the talks, Churkin told journalists that in Belgrade today, before leaving for Pale, he received a letter from President Boris Yeltsin addressed to Milosevic and Karadzic; that is, the Serbian leaders and the Serbian people. He said the letter presents Russia's stands, which are "in the interest of stopping the bloodshed." "The Serbian side will have to remove all heavy artillery around Sarajevo," Churkin said and announced that the Russian Federation would prepare fresh troops to be dispatched to the Sarajevo area to take part in the peacekeeping operation. This refers to 400 Russian soldiers who will be transfered to the Sarajevo area from within the Russian battalion currently deployed in the UN protected areas [in Croatia].
