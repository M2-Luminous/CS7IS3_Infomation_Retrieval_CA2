In a letter to Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy the president said he wished the Sejm reconsider the law which, he wrote, posed a threat to the continuation of market reforms in Poland and could pave the way for a return to centralistic and bureaucratic management of the economy. The law envisaged financial penalties for enterprises which increased wages of their employees above the limit set by the government. The penalties would amount to a tax equal to 150 percent of the excess in wages. The law would have applied to state and communal firms, but it also gave the government some control over pay in the private sector in a situation of "particular threat to the financial balance of the state." The law was a controversial issue even before its adoption, winning only the support of the government coalition parties (the Polish Peasant Party and the Democratic Left Alliance). They argued that a complete departure from all wage controls was not feasible in the present Polish situation and that the law was much less rigorous than the act it was to replace, the much-hated excess wage tax. Also, they pointed out that wage controls were not a Communist invention but a tough but necessary policy tool. The law was strongly opposed by other parliamentary factions and the Solidarity trade union, as well as by the right wing parties not represented in parliament. The latter were particularly critical of the powers vested in the government to control wages in the private sector in emergency situations. Reacting to the news of the presidential veto Thursday, leaders of those parties supported Walesa's decision. Piotr Marciniak of the left-wing Union of Labour (UP) also backed the veto, but pointed out that it was an element in Walesa's struggle against the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak issued a statement saying he wanted the Poles to enjoy Easter holidays in peace and therefore would not comment on the presidential veto. The Sejm will discuss the veto at a session scheduled for April 7. In order to overrule the veto, supporters of the law have to muster a two thirds majority.
