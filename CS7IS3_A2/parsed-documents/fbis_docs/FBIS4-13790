FBIS4-13790 "drnes079dd_94003" FBIS-NES-94-079 Daily Report 24 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs Fatah, Hamas Reach Cease-Fire Agreement in Gaza Fatah, Hamas Reach Cease-Fire Agreement in Gaza Fatah, Hamas Agreement Detailed TA2404130794 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew 24 Apr 94 p A3 TA2404130794 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ Hebrew BFN [Report by 'Amira Hess and Yosi Torpstein] [Excerpt] The Fatah Hawks and Hamas' [Islamic Resistance Movement] 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam group have announced their joint decision to stop killing collaborators for a period of one month, "on condition that during that period all efforts will be directed toward dealing with this phenomenon." They also urge the collaborators to "cut off their relations with the enemy's Shin Bet apparatus." The two groups also forbid all their armed and wanted men to intervene in conflicts between families and organizations, rather to let special reconciliation committees -- or when necessary, the political level -- deal with such conflicts. In a jointly signed leaflet disseminated in Gaza two days ago it is stated that the representatives of both sides have held a "historic session" and reached an agreement "aimed at strengthening national unity." The leaflet reiterates that this is necessary in order to foil Israeli attempts to polarize the Palestinian nation. The leaflet details six decisions regarding relations between the two groups and their violent treatment of various problems and social phenomena: To immediately stop mutual recriminations campaigns between Fatah and Hamas, while respecting all parties' freedom of expression; to stop all bloody feuds (which have recently proliferated between members of both organizations); "armed and wanted men from both sides are banned from intervening in conflicts between families and organizations." The leaflet urges minimizing the number of strikes, limiting their scope (for example, to the neighborhood of a victim only), and in emergencies to jointly declaring a strike. School children are urged not to take advantage of strike days, but rather to stick to their studies and oppose those who force them to strike. The two groups undertake to stop killing collaborators for a period of one month during which they will discuss this phenomenon and give the collaborators an opportunity to mend their ways. These decisions clearly reflect the growing criticism and dissatisfaction in the Gaza Strip concerning the behavior of the two groups and the terror they strike in people due to their trigger-happy mentality. Declaring a strike as a form of mourning has become a power demonstration method vis-a-vis other organizations, but this disrupts economic life -- which is difficult enough as it is. Despite the explicit instruction to continue studies on strike days, many students take advantage of this situation to skip school, and there are many complaints about the deteriorating level of studies. The intervention of armed fugitives from both organizations in various conflicts has already threatened to develop into bloody conflicts between the two organizations. In the Gaza Strip there is a phenomenon of "piratical confiscation" of vacant lots for enlarging houses or building stalls. In Rafah, for example, Fatah Hawks more than one month ago demolished a building built by Hamas for public ends (a medical center and kindergarten). When Hamas people tried to rebuild it, Fatah Hawks opened fire, killed one person and wounded approximately 25. Regarding collaborators, people in Gaza tend to believe that people who are murdered by 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam are indeed proven collaborators, and that they are not assassinated rashly. At the same time, despite the fact that everybody hates the collaborators, people are concerned about the ramifications of the almost daily killings, about possible "mistakes" and about the danger of vendettas. From various comments made by Fatah and Hamas people alike, it is clear that they too are concerned about the liberty taken by armed fugitives in these issues, mainly Fatah Hawks members.
