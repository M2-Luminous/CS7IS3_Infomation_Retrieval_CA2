FBIS4-38805 "drsov106_i_94001" FBIS-SOV-94-106 Daily Report 2 Jun 1994 CENTRAL ASIA Kazakhstan Scheduled Supreme Council Session Not Held Scheduled Supreme Council Session Not Held LD0106161494 LD0106161494 BFN [Editorial Report] Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian at 1243 GMT on 1 June carries a three-minute telephone link-up with Almaty correspondent Viktor Glukhovtsev. Glukhovtsev notes that the Kazakhstan Supreme Council session scheduled for today did not take place and continues: "This was a surprise, of course. Usually, the Supreme Council has worked to schedule and met its timetable in a more or less accurate way. And so, going through through the floors of the massive building and knocking on the doors of the offices where the deputies have settled, I ask the same question: Why? "The answers are most abstract, basically a shrugging of the shoulders and opaque hints about this having been prompted by the Supreme Council's statement in which deputies voiced no confidence in the social, economic and legal policy of the government. "One can't speak briefly about the origins of this document. I will note only that there has been a drastic fall in production in the republic; there is a precipitous fall in the rate of exchange of the national currency, and, as a result acute impoverishment of the population. And it is for this reason that the Supreme Council is giving an unambigously negative assessment of the present results of the actions of the Council of Ministers which is presented with the serious accusation that the government is essentially blocking its declared course toward a market economy. "In the view of the Supreme Soviet, this has led to economic chaos and in such a situation it isn't difficult to understand this reaction of the legislators. They saw, as the only way of avoiding a paralysis of power, a dialogue between all its branches in order to establish a national program of reforms and to form a government capable of fulfilling it. That's what's going on. "It's clear that a response from the president, who is the legal head of the executive authority and government in the republic, should follow such a statement. So far there has been no such response, and I think that it is for this reason that the plenary session never took place today. "Incidentally, in the office of one of the deputies I received, on what we shall call a confidential basis, confirmation of this conclusion. "Today, a document has today is being circulated amongst the deputies on behalf of a number of deputies' groups and factions which says, I quote: After the adoption of the statement, the coordinating council at its meeting, in violation of the provisional statute, postponed the next plenary session, allegedly on the grounds of its lack of preparation. We consider this to be an attempt to repudiate the busineslike spirit of the statement and to turn it into an empty, non-binding declaration. And it appears that the hope has not been lost to turn the Supreme Council into an obedient tool of executive authority and into an administrative and legal department attached to the cabinet of ministers and the president. End quote."
