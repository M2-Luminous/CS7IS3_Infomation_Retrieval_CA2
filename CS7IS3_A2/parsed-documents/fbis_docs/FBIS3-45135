The theme of this meeting is to convey the guidelines laid down by the central meeting on rural work and to study and formulate measures to further emancipate people's minds, seize the opportunity, and speed up comprehensive agricultural, rural economic, and social development in the region. Zhao Fulin, secretary of the regional party committee, delivered an important speech at the meeting. Zhao Fulin's speech focused on five topics: 1) Having a thorough understanding of the extreme importance of agricultural, rural, and agrarian issues under socialist market economy conditions; 2) the current situation in agriculture and rural work in the region; 3) emancipating people's minds, seizing the opportunity, and speeding up comprehensive agricultural, rural economic, and social development; 4) carrying out rural reform in depth, and speeding up the establishment of a rural economic operational mechanism which suits the needs of the socialist market economy; and 5) intensifying leadership over agriculture and rural work. [passage omitted] Talking about the effort to speed up comprehensive agricultural, rural economic, and social development, Comrade Zhao Fulin pointed out that it is necessary to concentrate on the following aspects: With the market condition as a guide, we are to speed up the readjustment of the production structure in rural areas and optimize the allocation of resources; we are to vigorously develop township and town enterprises, accelerate the process of relocation of the rural labor force, and speed up construction of small cities and towns; we are to implement the development strategy of invigorating agriculture through promotion of education; we are to strengthen infrastructure for agriculture, improve production conditions, and preserve high-yield grain-growing farmland; we are to step up our effort to aid impoverished areas, enabling them to speed up their pace in extricating themselves from poverty and getting rich; and we are to step up the development of socialist spiritual civilization and of democracy and the legal system, and to do a good a job in comprehensive management of public security. Referring to the effort to deepen rural reform and speed up the establishment of a rural economic operational mechanism which suits the needs of the socialist market economy, Comrade Zhao Fulin noted: We must heighten our sense of urgency to seize the opportunity to accomplish the reform. In view of the actual circumstances in this region, we must focus our attention on the following tasks: We are to further stabilize and perfect the responsibility system, mainly the contracted responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration to output, and the two-tier operational system characterized by integration of centralized management and independent operation. First of all we are to stabilize and perfect relations stemming from farmland management contracts; secondly, we are to perfect unified collective management system and strengthen its role of serving the peasants; meanwhile, we are to vigorously introduce various types of joint-stock systems and joint-stock cooperative systems, enhance rational allocation and combination of resources, vigorously promote the socialized service network in rural areas, and step up the establishment of an operational form featuring the integration of trade, industry, and agriculture, and of production, processing, and marketing. We are to establish a unified urban-rural market system, and gradually build up a great commodity circulation structure. We are to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control, and constantly intensify the government's role in macroscopic guidance and management of the rural economy. Comrade Zhao Fulin stressed that party committees and governments at all levels must steadfastly place agriculture before all other economic tasks, earnestly strengthening leadership. In the meantime, the regional party committee and the regional people's government must devote great efforts to rural work, while prefectural, county, and city party committees, as well as prefectural administrative commissioners' offices and county and city governments, must focus on and devote most energy to rural work. Party committee secretaries and government leaders at all levels should constantly pay attention to and personally attend to rural work. When dealing with major issues concerning rural reform and development, they must personally conduct investigations and studies, before making decisions and adopting measures. And they must monitor the implementation of such measures thereafter. More than 500 people, including principal persons-in-charge of various prefectures, cities, and counties, and leading comrades from departments concerned, attended the meeting. Present at the meeting were regional leaders Zhao Fulin, Cheng Kejie [provincial governor], Liu Mingzu, Ding Tingmo, Li Zhenqian, Lin Chaoqun, Li Enchao, Yuan Zhengzhong, Ma Qingsheng, Yang Jichang, He Bin, Lei Yu, Xu Bingsong, Lu Bing, Yuan Fenglan, Liu Hong, and Long Chuan.
