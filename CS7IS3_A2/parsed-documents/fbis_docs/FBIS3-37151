Since last November, Russia's major television companies have owed Azerbaijan's Communications Ministry over 500 million rubles for the hire of technical equipment and other services. This has obviously had its effect on payments between the communications and the energy sectors and has also delayed the salaries of specialists by several months. A telegram demanding that the debt be cleared was sent to Moscow, and the reply--signed by the heads of technical services at the two television companies--came quite quickly: We have no money, and accept that transmission of our programs will be stopped. The lack of a solution to the financial problems could lead to cuts in broadcasts by Azerbaijan's own national television. In the first two months of this year, the republic's Finance Ministry allocated only one quarter of the funds it needed to pay communications workers. So, television could very well be added to our list of shortages very soon.
