After greeting Zedillo and wishing him success in his campaign for the Presidency, Aspe Armella noted that if in fact it is a day of mourning, it must also be a day of hope. Aspe Armella asked reporters to let him make some statements. He said he had the privilege of working with Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon in different areas for several years, adding that Zedillo is a man with great talent, an intelligent, honorable, decent man, and a man who knows perfectly well the program of Luis Donaldo Colosio. The secretary of finance and public credit had to wait in line like other people who were at the PRI headquarters to greet candidate Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon. Fernando Solana Morales, secretary of public education, was also there. He said that after leaving the Secretariat of Public Education, Zedillo was fully devoted to Luis Donaldo Colosio's candidacy, adding that this is a guarantee he is a unity candidate. Emilio Lozoya Thalmann, secretary of energy, mines, and parastate industry, was also there. He, like his fellow party members, rallied for unity and solidarity behind Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon. Regrettably, the Zedillo's speech to the members of the Political Council and the National Executive Committee was not heard by the first groups of supporters who arrived at the PRI headquarters to express their support for the nominated candidate. There were groups of [words indistinct] small businessmen of the State of Mexico and the Federal District. Guillermina Rico, leader the former street vendors, was among the first to greet Zedillo. Zedillo's speech lasted nearly 20 minutes, but some people did not hear it. Outside, calls of Colosio, Colosio, could be heard. People outside then learned from media representatives that the announcement had been made official. People then asked for Zedillo come out to the plaza so they could see his face. Some people said they wanted to see and hear the candidate live and not on television. After this official announcement was made, a master of ceremonies presided over the salutation ceremony. Curiously, this greeting did not take place outside the PRI headquarters but inside a room of the PRI offices. Many people, including secretaries of state, waited in line to enter the building. Genaro Borrego Estrada, director of the Mexican Social Security Institute, was also there. Security around the candidate was tight. A metal fence was placed outside to avoid overcrowding. During the reception, those who wanted to shake hands with candidate Zedillo proceeded in an orderly manner. At the end of the reception, which lasted approximately two hours until 1500, Zedillo went up to his office on the second floor of Building Two of the PRI National Headquarters and that was the end of it. Then the people who stood outside the PRI office walked away peacefully. The PRI is in mourning, but, like Aspe Armella said, it has new hope in Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon.
