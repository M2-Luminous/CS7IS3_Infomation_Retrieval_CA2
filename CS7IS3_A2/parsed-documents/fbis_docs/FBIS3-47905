"It was untrue. There would be no such replacement," he told the press after the transfer of the post of ABRI's social and political affairs chief of staff from Lieutenant General Hariyoto P.S. to Major General R. Hartono. He said that he has lately been questioned whether the ABRI chief would be replaced. "I should reiterate that there will be no such a replacement," he said. ANTARA sources said that the possibility of the ABRI chief replacement was on stage following a speculation on the retirement of the ABRI chief by the end of this year. On the occasion the ABRI spokesman revealed that the governor of the National Defense Institute (Lemhanas) will be held by Major General Muntojib, replacing Major General R. Hartono. "Muntojib's post as ABRI's staff and command school (Sesko) director will be transferred to Major General Theo Syafei, who is now the Udayana regional military commander," he added. He said that Brigadier General Adang Ruchiatna will take the post to be left by Major General Theo Syafei.
