On 12 May the "Foreign Trade Law of the PRC" was adopted by the NPC Standing Committee and will be put into effect on 1 July, thus putting China's foreign trade management on a legal footing. How is the current situation with China's foreign trade and with the reforms in the foreign trade management system? What are the prospects? All these issues have attracted the greatest attention from China's economic circles. Reporters from this newspaper interviewed Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, asking her to express her views on these issues. [JINGJI RIBAO] Minister Wu, the first four months this year saw a good foreign trade situation. According to relevant statistics, foreign trade grew in an all-round way. In particular export trade grew more rapidly, thus increasing China's foreign exchange reserves. In 1993, China's foreign trade volume accounted for 37 percent of its gross domestic product. The people are very concerned about the development of foreign trade, because it closely relates to their interests. Will you please give a detailed account of the situation? [Wu] In the first four months of this year, China's foreign trade developed in a rapid, coordinated, and sound way. In my view, there were four characteristics: One, import and export trade grew in a comprehensive way. According to statistics provided by Customs, the total foreign trade value was $57.84 billion, up 21.1 percent over the figure for the same period last year. This growth rate is higher than the figures for the same periods of previous years. The situations in various areas indicated that apart from one or two provinces and autonomous regions which registered a decrease in foreign trade volume, most provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions chalked up increases in foreign trade volume. Two, export trade grew at a greater pace. The export volume for the four months was $28.04 billion, up 22 percent over the figure for the same period last year. What merits special attention is that the general export business [yi ban mao yi chu kou 0001 5301 6319 2496 0427 0656], which had achieved less satisfactory results over the last few years, grew rapidly by 30.5 percent, bigger than the growth rate of 22.1 percent achieved by processing export. This is the first laudable trend seen in the last few years and more. Three, there was a decrease in the growth rate of the import volume, which was $29.79 billion, up 20.3 percent. In terms of absolute value, the export volume has approached the import volume. The current tendency suggests that we are likely to strike a balance between imports and exports in the future. Four, we earned more foreign exchange than we sold. The national situation with foreign exchange is quite good. We have a bigger foreign exchange reserve than we did at the beginning of the year. Of course there are some difficulties and problems with our foreign trade business. The fairly spectacular problems are: A shortage of circulating funds, a sharp rise in the purchase price of exports, and insufficient potential for future development of export trade. [JINGJI RIBAO] The situation with foreign trade has been relatively good since the beginning of this year. Is this the result of accelerated reform of the foreign trade management system? [Wu] I think so. Reform has promoted the development of foreign trade. Since the beginning of this year, we have made a very important step forward in the reform of the foreign trade management system. In particular the reforms of the exchange rate mechanism and of the export quota distribution system laid a sound foundation for the long-term development of foreign trade. It should be said that the situation of foreign trade in the first four months this year showed the positive effect of the reform of the foreign trade management system. This accords with our expectations. Under the new foreign trade system, exchange rates, taxation, and credit have become important economic means for regulating foreign economic activities. Since the beginning of this year, the exchange rate of the renminbi has been stable. This created a favorable environment for foreign trade. I also believe that the stable exchange rate gives expression to the sound development in foreign trade, in export trade in particular, seen since the beginning of the year. The current exchange rate mechanism has already become a market mechanism. Basically speaking, a stable exchange rate depends on the balanced and sound development of national foreign trade. [JINGJI RIBAO] The reform of the export quota distribution system you mentioned is a main topic of conversation regarding the reform of foreign trade this year. The experiment with open bidding for quotas for 13 export commodities, including logs and ginseng, carried out since April this year has had a great impact on enterprises engaged in the export of these commodities and has aroused popular concern. Would you please talk about its significance? [Wu] The plan to have bidding, auctions, and formula allocation of import and export quotas is contained in the "Decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee on Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure." This represents the orientation of the reform of the quota management system. This year, we had bidding for 13 selected export commodities with active quotas [zhu dong pei e 0031 0520 6792 7345] on a trial basis. The export value of these commodities accounted for about 7 percent of that of all export commodities subject to quota control. The bidding proved successful and it was conducted in accordance with the principle of ensuring economic returns, fairness, and openness. A significant phenomenon was that the enterprises to which no or only a few quotas had been given before enthusiastically welcomed the new measure, while the companies which had enjoyed quotas before displayed apathy about the reform because their privileges had been axed. In my opinion such a reaction is normal. What matters is that those companies which lost "privileges" must adapt themselves to the law of competition under the market economy and reestablish their superiority through competition on an equal footing. In the future, on the basis of the experiment, we will have bidding for more commodities with quotas. [JINGJI RIBAO] At present large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises are encountering many difficulties. How to deepen reform to enliven these enterprises has once again become a major problem of public concern. Apart from foreign-funded enterprises, a total of 7,000 enterprises have been granted the right to engage in foreign trade. They are all state-owned enterprises, among which quite a lot are large and medium-sized enterprises. How do matters stand with these enterprises? [Wu] Since the beginning of this year, foreign trade enterprises nationwide have fared well. The reform policies put into effect this year are beneficial to state foreign trade companies, large and medium-sized companies in particular. By applying the measure for making unified settlement of foreign exchange accounts payable and doing away with the practice of turning in a fixed amount of foreign exchange to the central government with or without compensation, the central government has lessened the burden of state foreign trade companies so that they can enter fair competition. This will help these companies develop into efficient companies. The process of the reform in the foreign trade management system over the last few years shows that we have always put the reform of foreign trade companies in an important position. From 1988 to 1990, by introducing the contracted managerial responsibility system, foreign trade companies solved the problem resulting from "eating from the same big pot," regaining their vitality and increasing their strength. The 1991 reform aimed at abolishing subsidies and making enterprises responsible for their profits and losses enabled foreign trade companies to develop into companies which make their own management decisions and are responsible for their own profits and losses. The reform this year is being carried out on the basis of previous reforms, so it will give an extremely big stimulus to foreign trade companies. As required by our principle for reform, foreign trade companies should deepen reform in light of the modern enterprise system. In this way, they will make greater contributions to the development of foreign trade. [JINGJI RIBAO] There was information that the new tax reform had increased the burden on foreign-funded enterprises. What is your comment on this? [Wu] I believe the information is incorrect. We have consistently seen to it that the foreign businessmen's legitimate rights and interests are respected and protected. In the latest round of reform of the foreign trade management system we introduced the system of earning and selling foreign exchange into state foreign trade enterprises while we only introduced transitional measures into foreign-funded enterprises, allowing them to keep foreign exchange accounts to facilitate their operations, including foreign trade. As a whole, the tax reform has not brought a greater burden to foreign-funded enterprises. For one or two foreign-funded enterprises which will have a greater tax burden, we have worked out regulations for providing subsidies to ensure that foreign businessmen enjoy the preferential policies laid down in China's laws and cooperation agreements. The preferential policies toward foreign investors remain unchanged. We will continue to improve the environment for investment and create conditions to grant foreign- funded enterprises "national treatment." [JINGJI RIBAO] You, as minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, are responsible for promoting the country's foreign trade and economic cooperation with foreign countries. It is an arduous duty. At present what is your greatest concern? [Wu] My work covers an extensive area and I have many "major problems" to solve. To be frank, I feel the pressure of my work. My greatest concern, it should be said, is China's export business. Can the momentum over the last four months continue? While realizing the active effect brought about by reform, we should have a sober understanding of the factors detrimental to export. The two major problems are: A sharp increase in the price of export commodities and a shortage of funds. Many products exported early this year were purchased last year or made from the raw materials purchased last year, when their prices were low. But the prices of export commodities purchased this year were much higher. Many foreign trade companies have reported that their business is greatly affected. I believe my ministry cannot solve these problems on its own. To promote China's foreign trade, we must carry out a "grand economic and trade" strategy based on foreign trade, under which operations concerning commodities, funds, technology, service, and labor service abroad will interpenetrate and develop in a coordinated way, and which will involve departments responsible for foreign trade, production, science and technology, and financial affairs. In the meantime, to meet the needs of economic development, foreign trade enterprises should introduce intensive management, carrying out the strategy of "increasing sales by improving the quality of their products," focusing on optimizing the product mix, promoting technological progress, and improving their economic performance so that they change their main products from textile and other light industrial goods, primary processing products, and products with low added value to machinery and electrical appliances, heavy industry products, chemicals, high-tech products, intensive processing products, and products with high added value by 2000. This is essential to developing China's foreign trade.
