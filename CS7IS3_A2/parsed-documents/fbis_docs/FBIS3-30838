Among the members of the Polish delegation was Sejm Deputy Jacek Uczkiewicz, a member of the Supreme Board of Social Democracy of the Polish Republic [SdRP] and secretary to the Wroclaw Voivodship SdRP Executive Committee. He took part in the proceedings as assistant Assembly member. [passage omitted] [Zwolinska] The Polish delegation went to Strasbourg in an incomplete composition, did it not? The Democratic Union took umbrage and withdrew its participation.... [Uczkiewicz] I was present throughout all of the stages of completing the makeup of our delegation. Consequently, I am able to tell you that the reasons given by the Union in its official statement are not entirely correct. Judging from my observation of the behavior of the Democratic Union deputies, I would risk stating that they were predominantly motivated by the fact that our delegation as a whole refused to approve the recommendation of Hanna Suchocka to the function of deputy chairperson to the Assembly. In the end, her place was taken by Tadeusz Iwinski, head of our delegation and representative of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]. [Zwolinska] What do you mean when you say "her place was taken"? [Uczkiewicz] That was the result of a democratic vote. In any case, one of the Assembly's ruling principles is that the composition of any given state's delegation should faithfully reflect the political configuration of forces in that state's own parliamentary assembly. By boycotting the Assembly session, the Democratic Union expected to encourage the entire European Community to boycott the Polish delegation in turn. However, our delegation was received entirely normally by the Assembly, whereas the Democratic Union's move was interpreted as a gesture directed against the Assembly's principal idea. [Zwolinska] Who interpreted in in that way? [Uczkiewicz] The delegates gathered at the Assembly, headed by Miguel Martinez, who is currently chairman of the CE. He actually mentioned the subject of the vacant seats in the Polish delegation's composition during a meeting he had with us. He expressed a most critical opinion about the Union's position, which he saw as an expression of a failure to understand the democratic nature of the rules of the game. He deemed it regrettable that the Democratic Union attempted to play its internal games at the expense of the CE and its Assembly. [passage omitted] [Zwolinska] Did the Polish delegation maintain a high profile in Strasbourg? [Uczkiewicz] It was one of the most numerous and most active delegations there. Parliament members representing other countries generally agree that Poland can play an important role in the process of political expansion of Europe's borders and in the blurring of the distinction between East and West Europe. And it is worth remembering that the terminology based on this distinction is still widely used--even in CE documents. [Zwolinska] Thank you for talking to us.
