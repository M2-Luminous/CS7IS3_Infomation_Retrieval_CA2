Station observer Krichevskiy has the following commentary on this issue: In addition to the length of his visit to this neighboring country, we also know the scope of the issues that the Russian foreign minister will discuss while visiting Beijing. First of all, these issues are relevant to the preparations for the second Russian-Chinese summit. Because Yeltsin visited China before the winter of last year, it is now Jiang Zemin's turn to visit Russia. The Russian-Chinese summit will settle several issues relevant to strengthening the two countries' bilateral ties and their partnership in the international arena. Kozyrev's visit (?will be) conducive to this matter. He plans to discuss with Chinese leaders the possibilities of and prospects for developing economic cooperation and trade and scientific-technological cooperation, as well the border issue. For example, the two sides will sign an accord on establishing border checkpoints [words indistinct] improve the situation along Russian-Chinese border. The establishment of checkpoints will also help prevent trouble from arising from the border trade carried out in areas between adjacent Russian oblasts and Chinese provinces. As far as economic ties and trade are concerned, (?both sides) have expressed their dissatisfaction with their current state. Nobody doubts that these ties will expand and will become more successful in the future, even though China's trade volume with Russia already puts it in second place in this category. In the area of economic cooperation, there is an increasingly pressing need for Russia to study the experiences that China has gained in carrying out economic reform. We should know why China's economic development has been gathering speed -- speed which reached approximately 13 percent last year -- as a result of its reform, whereas in Russia the rapidity has been decreasing each year. The discussion of this question cannot be avoided during Kozyrev's visit. China's experiences in building special economic zones undoubtedly have been successful. Incidentally, Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev and his experts and advisers also have plan to visit the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, while their talks in the Chinese capital will deal with international issues. Russia and China are the two biggest countries in the Asia- Pacific region. To a great extent, the relaxation of regional conflicts and [word indistinct] development in economic relations and trade in this region depend on Russia and China. Moreover, the deepening of the Russian-Chinese partnership in all fields, including the deepening of cooperation in military technology, is not directed at any third country in any way. In fact, the more solid that Russian-Chinese relations become, the more stable the situation in the Asia-Pacific region will be. On the contrary, if Russian-Chinese relations do deteriorate in any way, this deterioration will have unfavorable effects on the overall situation in the Asia-Pacific region.
