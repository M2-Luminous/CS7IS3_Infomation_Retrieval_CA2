Our correspondent represented the Hungarian press at this meeting that lasted more than one hour and that was also recorded by Slovak Television. We publish here Jozef Moravcik's answers to our correspondent's questions. [Farkas] Mr. Moravcik! Elections are scheduled in Slovakia in September, but the new Hungarian parliament will be elected in May. Do you still see any possibility of developing cooperation with the current Hungarian leadership? [Moravcik] From Bratislava, at first sight it seems that the current leadership in Budapest is not particularly worried about the coming elections. We are not dealing with the timing of the Hungarian elections, either, because we are regarding our relations in broader aspects. However, we are aware of the fact that diplomatic actions are in preparation in Europe that could also be used well in shaping the relations between our countries. I mean the coming Paris conference. No doubt, we would both benefit if we could solve our problems without outside assistance like the International Court, and if we succeeded in preventing phenomena that lead to instability. This requires the creation of foundations that facilitate a more rational solution of our problems. We are ready to take such a step anytime. [Farkas] Do you see any possibility for Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszy to carry out his visit that was postponed in November 1993? [Moravcik] When I was foreign minister, we confirmed, together with my Hungarian colleague, that the aforementioned visit was to the benefit of both of us. However, as you know, the problem of the extradition agreement emerged at the time. I am convinced that we will overcome this obstacle that hinders this visit, and the planned visits will take place. We are also interested in opening new border-crossing points, and the Slovak-Hungarian border is no exception to this, although there are a lot more crossing points along this border than along our other borders. However, our relations are specific, and, thus, the solutions must also be specific. We are ready to open further crossing points. [Farkas] The economy can play an important role in our cooperation. However, your predecessor, Mr. Meciar, objected to the fact that Hungarian capital allegedly had an exaggerated presence in southern Slovakia. [Moravcik] It is generally useless to limit the inflow of capital, and this particularly applies to Slovakia, which is only a small piece of land in Europe. Besides, capital is increasingly becoming international, and it is increasingly hopeless to look for national features on it. Therefore, I find it totally useless to seek ethnic features in the flow of capital. [Farkas] In conclusion, a question about the distribution of the Danube waters. The European Union submitted a separate note to your predecessor, but Mr. Meciar's answer is not known. Is it possible that it will be your government's task to answer it? If so, what can we expect? [Moravcik] Actually, there was no talk of any obligation to answer this note because it summed up the position of the European Union for the Slovak Government. As for the distribution of water itself, I regard this primarily as a technical problem, and I agree with Mr. Jeszenszky that, given the fact that this is a technical problem, we should tackle the problem accordingly.
