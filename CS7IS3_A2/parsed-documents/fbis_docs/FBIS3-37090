It was agreed to set up a special working team to study the problem. It is to draw up a draft agreement on this unique scientific complex for the Russo-Kazakh summit, scheduled for the end of March. Kozyrev visited the Baykonur cosmodrome on the last day of his official visit. He was accompanied by Kazakh Foreign Minister Tuleutay Suleymenov. Baykonur holds pride of place in the history of world science, especially cosmonautics. This is from where mankind had for the first time ventured into outer space, turning a new page in the history of civilisation. The world's first artificial earth satellite was orbited from Baykonur in October 1957. The first cosmonaut, Yuriy Gagarin, was launched into outer space from there in April 1961. The first "Buran" reusable vehicle was launched from Baykonur in 1988. The international space observatory "Granat", orbited from there in December 1989, is still functioning in outer space. It is designed to carry out strategic observations and to study cosmic, roentgen and gamma rays. Russia, France, Bulgaria and Denmark are taking part in the project. A spaceship, carrying a Soviet-Australian expedition, including a representative of Kazakhstan, was launched from Baykonur for the first time in the 40-year-long history of the space centre, on October 2, 1991. The next stage of the cosmodrome's history was marked by the launching of a Soyuz TM-13 rocket. This event ushered in a new era in the cosmodrome's history. Kozyrev overflew the installations of the cosmodrome and talked to the heads of Baykonur's military and civilian personnels. Taking part in the talk was Colonel-General Vladimir Ivanov, commander of the Military Space Forces of the Russian Defence Ministry, Acting Chief of the Baykonur Cosmodrome Major-General Viktor Grafinin, and head of the Leninsk Administration Vitaliy Brynkin. In accordance with a decree signed by the Kazakh president in 1991, all the enterprises, organisations and institutions on the territory of Kazakhstan were declared Kazakh state property, including the Baykonur cosmodrome. Naturally, this posed new difficult problems before the complex. It will not be an exaggeration to say that Kazakhstan is unable to cope with all the problems linked with the exploitation of this unique space complex. Suffice it to say that Russia had spent 47 billion roubles to keep Baykonur going in 1993 alone. Ninety-four per cent of all the spendings on the complex are borne by Russia and only six per cent by Kazakhstan in accordance with an agreement concluded between the two countries. As much as 259 billion roubles will be required to finance Baykonur in 1994. During the meeting with the Russian foreign minister, Chief of the Cosmodrome Viktor Grafinin said that 22 launchings of different space vehicles, both military and civilian, were effected from Baykonur in 1992, and four in 1994, including one piloted vehicle. Dwelling on problems facing the cosmodrome today, he laid accent on two main problems -- determination of the cosmodrome's status and solution of tasks linked with the social protection of its personnel. Kozyrev flew to Moscow right after his tour of Baykonur installations.
