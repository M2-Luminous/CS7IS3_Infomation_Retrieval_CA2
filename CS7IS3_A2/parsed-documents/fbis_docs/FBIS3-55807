The statements by NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner and U.S. President Bill Clinton, both favorable of the security interests of Eastern Europe "were the maximum we could have," Kull told a BNS correspondent. Woerner said NATO's message to the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe was one and the same: the countries won't be left on their own luck. "If we admit new members to NATO, this must help to stabilize Europe and not to divide it once again," he said. NATO leaders in the summit offered the nations of Eastern Europe cooperation under the "Partnership for Peace" program. The program gives the region no binding security guarantees, but NATO under the scheme would accept the obligation to engage in security consultations with countries participating in the program, if the country feels its security threatened. Kull said he regarded NATO members as ready to "go rather far" in case the security of countries involved in the program was threatened. But he added that the alliance was likely to abstain from military intervention, but use "strong political means of influence" instead. The Estonian ambassador said preparations for the NATO summit had taken place under heavy pressure from the Eastern Europe. He said the pressure had contributed to entering some new clauses into the final document of the meeting, such as the words that the NATO "doors are open." Kull was sure that NATO and the Western countries were interested in the Baltics as a possible sphere of interest. "It is absolutely clear that a policy of dividing the spheres of interest is under way in Europe," Kull said. "Also Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev has said that Russia has geopolitical interests, which are determined by the borders of the former Soviet Union. If it is not Russia that has its influence there, someone else will fill the place," Kull quoted Kozyrev as saying. But Kull also said the interest of the West in the Baltic region could be described as economic and social rather than military and political.
