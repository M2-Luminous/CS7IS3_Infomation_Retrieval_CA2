FR940607-1-00007 FR940607-1-00001 (b) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to an order of an Immigration Judge under §3.23 or §242.22 of this chapter denying a motion to reopen or reconsider or to stay deportation, except where such order expressly grants a stay or where the motion was filed pursuant to the provisions of §3.23(b)(5). The Board may, in its discretion, stay deportation while an appeal is pending from any such order if no stay has been granted by the Immigration Judge or a Service officer. 10. Section 3.7 is revised to read as follows: §3.7 Notice of certification. Whenever, in accordance with the provisions of §3.1(c) of this part, a case is required to be certified to the Board, the alien or other party affected shall be given notice of certification. An Immigration Judge or Service Officer may certify a case only after an initial decision has been made and before an appeal has been taken. If it is known at the time the initial decision is rendered that the case will be certified, the notice of certification shall be included in such decision and no further notice of certification shall be required. If it is not known until after the initial decision is rendered that the case will be certified, the office of the Service or Office of the Immigration Judge having administrative control over the record of proceeding shall cause a Notice of Certification to be served upon the parties. In either case, the notice shall inform the parties that the case is required to be certified to the Board and that they have the right to make representations before the Board, including the making of a request for oral argument and the submission of a brief. If either party desires to submit a brief, it shall be submitted to the office of the Service or Office of the Immigration Judge having administrative control over the record of proceeding for transmittal to the Board within the time prescribed in §3.3(c) of this part. The case shall be certified and forwarded to the Board by the office of the Service or Office of the Immigration Judge having administrative jurisdiction over the case upon receipt of the brief, or upon the expiration of the time within which the brief may be submitted, or upon receipt of a written waiver of the right to submit a brief. The Board in its discretion may elect to accept for review or not accept for review any such certified case. If the Board declines to accept a certified case for review, the underlying decision shall become final on the date of the Board's declination. 11. Section 3.8 is revised to read as follows: §3.8 Fees. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a notice of appeal or motion filed under this subpart by any person other than an officer of the Service relating to a proceeding held before an Immigration Judge shall be accompanied by evidence that the specified fee has been remitted in accordance with the applicable provisions of §§3.38(c) and 103.7 of this chapter. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a notice of appeal or motion filed under this subpart by any person other than an officer of the Service relating to a matter involving an adjudication by an officer of the Service shall be accompanied by the specified fee and remitted in accordance with the applicable provisions of §103.7 of this chapter. In any case in which an alien or other party affected is unable to pay the fee fixed for an appeal or a motion, he or she shall file with the notice of appeal or the motion his or her affidavit or unsworn declaration, made pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746, stating the nature of the motion or appeal and his or her belief that he or she is entitled to redress. Such document shall also establish his or her inability to pay the required fee, and shall request permission to prosecute the appeal or motion without payment of such fee. When such a document is filed with the officer of the Service or the Immigration Judge from whose decision the appeal is taken or with respect to whose decision the motion is addressed, such Service Officer or Immigration Judge shall, if he or she believes that the appeal or motion is not taken or made in good faith, certify in writing his or her reasons for such belief for consideration by the Board. The Board may, in its discretion, authorize the prosecution of any appeal or motion without payment of the required fee.
