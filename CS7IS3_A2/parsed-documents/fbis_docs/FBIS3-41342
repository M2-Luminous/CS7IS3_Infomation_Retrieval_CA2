"The change in the U.S. counternarcotics policy confirms that this policy did not yield the expected results." Although "billions of dollars were spent, nothing was attained," he said. Fujimori made the remark in a news conference at the Narino Presidential Palace at the end of a two-day official visit. Fujimori said that, in view of the failure of the U.S. counternarcotics policy, the governments of the coca-producing countries, including Peru and Colombia, should outline joint strategies and insist that consumption is the reason for the persistence of drug trafficking. According to Fujimori, "it is necessary to reassess" the alleged reduction in drug use, a crime "that has distorted our economies." He insisted that the problem "should be tackled by everyone involved" and that "imaginative solutions" should be sought. He said the war on drugs as it has been waged, "should not continue this way without offering alternatives to coca planters." He also said that his country cannot repress "200,000 poor coca planters" without offering them other ways out. He pointed out that drug trafficking must be attacked by "hitting the big ones, not the poor ones." He insisted that drug trafficking could end "when there is economic development." The end of drug trafficking, without setting any deadlines, "does not depend on us, but on consumers," Fujimori concluded.
