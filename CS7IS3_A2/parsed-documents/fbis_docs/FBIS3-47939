"Although the Korean peninsula has not become particularly strained, considering the fact that tension exists there we must study how to respond to various situations arising from a hypothetical outbreak of conflict," Aichi told reporters. Aichi was believed to be alluding to possible economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council against North Korea over Pyongyang's suspected nuclear weapons program. North Korea has warned that it will not stand idle if subjected to an economic blockade. On the question of Japanese support for U.S. troops based in Japan were such a conflict to break out, Aichi said it would be decided on a "case-by-case" basis. "We would have to consider to what extent we could (lend support) in the context of maintaining the Japan-U.S. alliance," he said. Defense Agency officials said the United States has already asked for Japan's support in such an event. They said the request is being considered primarily by the Foreign Ministry.
