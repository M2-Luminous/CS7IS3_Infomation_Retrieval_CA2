The funds will be awarded under Section 340A of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 256a. The purpose of these grants is to provide primary health services, as defined in section 330(b)(1) of the PHS Act, including health screenings, and health counseling and education services to residents of public housing.

This activity will assist in implementing section 1707(d)(1) of the PHS Act and will enable public housing grantees to organize and operate Minority Community Health Coalitions (MCHC) and to implement HIV/AIDS health education and prevention strategies.
