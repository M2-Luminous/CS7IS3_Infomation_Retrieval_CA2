The top Japanese business organization made the proposal in a report on reforming Japan's government-backed financial system. It said a further expansion of the postal savings and postal insurance services should be avoided since they receive various forms of government protection. The report also said Japan's future monetary policies should be based more on the nation's money supply and land and other asset values, not just interest rates and price trends as at present. It offered trial calculations on the effects of the money supply on economic growth and rises in land and stock prices. The report noted the money supply grew at an annual rate of more than 10 percent in the "bubble economy" years between fiscal 1987 and 1990. It said if that increase rate was curbed to the average nominal growth rate of 7 percent for gross national product in the period, the year-to-year rise in land prices in Tokyo and five other big Japanese cities in fiscal 1990 would have been limited to 0.6 percent, instead of the actual 11 percent.
