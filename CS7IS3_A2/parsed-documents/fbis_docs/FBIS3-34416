Although in such cases, the Zionist regime, which is helpless when it comes to such operations by the Muslim revolutionaries, always resorts to blind attacks on residential areas and finds many innocent Lebanese people rolling in blood, the continuation of the anti-Zionist resistance is of extreme political significance. Overtly colluding with the United States during the past two years, the Zionist regime has tried to make it look as if it seeks peace and attempted to hide its aggressive nature by participating in the so-called peace conference and by propagating false slogans. But the continuing operations by the Islamic Resistance mojahidin thwart much of this effort by Israel and clarify that the Zionist regime continues to occupy part of Lebanon and some other Arab countries and that it also extensively violates international regulations. The operations by Lebanon's Muslim mujahidin against the Zionist occupiers also clarify another reality: Contrary to what the heads of some Arab states claim, Tel Aviv is vulnerable. Justifying their participation in the compromising talks with Israel in Washington, the Arab governments always speak of upsetting the Middle East's military balance in Israel's favor. But if this is true, then the operations by the Lebanese Muslim mujahidin show that having faith in the struggle against this usurping regime can alter the material and power balance to a large extent.
