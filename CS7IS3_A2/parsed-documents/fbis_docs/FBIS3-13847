An official Palestinian source has affirmed that the Security Council resolution constitutes a basis for immediate enforcement of the measures necessary to protect the Palestinian people in the occupied territories in order to guarantee the successful resumption of peace negotiations with Israel. Following a meeting under Yasir 'Arafat's chairmanship today, the PLO called on the international community, particularly the sponsors of the peace process, to act immediately to implement the Council resolution, because guaranteeing the safety of the Palestinian people and international protection for them is an essential necessity. The PLO underlined the need to eliminate the terrorist pockets in the settlements and to discuss the status of armed settlers. The official source noted that the PLO welcomed the issuing of the Security Council resolution despite all the difficulties and obstacles that were raised to obstruct or avert it. The PLO also welcomed the international community's condemnation and its endorsement of specific measures to guarantee protection for the Palestinian people on their occupied territories, including the disarming of settlers and the provision of an international presence to protect the Palestinian people. The PLO pointed out that this consensus denotes a public awareness of the ugliness of the massacre, its dimensions and causes, as well as eagerness to guarantee the safety and protection of the Palestinian people. The organization regretted the U.S. abstention on two paragraphs on Jerusalem and the occupied territories. It affirmed that this attitude affects the U.S. reputation, particularly since the issue is related to Jerusalem--a very vital issue at the Palestinian, Arab, Islamic, Christian, and international levels--and casts doubts on the permanence of official U.S. stands on some basic aspects in the regional conflict.
