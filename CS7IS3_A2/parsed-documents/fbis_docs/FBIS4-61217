This Is the Opinion of Experts With Whom Commission Chairman Nikolay Ryabov Resolutely Disagrees"] [Text] The Experts: "The Elections to the Federal Assembly Were Falsified" Having analyzed the official data of the Central Electoral Commission [CEC] and a number of district electoral commissions in accordance with its own statistical methods, a special expert group to study the results of elections and referendums under the President's Administration reached this conclusion: The elections to the Federal Assembly were falsified. In the experts' estimation, approximately 3.5 million votes were falsified at the level of precinct commissions, and approximately 5.7 million at the level of district commissions. The experts classified the forgeries in three types. "Classic" falsifications at the level of electoral precincts: Casting of additional voting papers, administrative coercion of voters to vote for a particular candidate or for a particular list of candidates. In the opinion of Aleksandr Sobyanin, leader of the expert group, the scale of such falsifications amounted to approximately 1.8 million voting papers in favor of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (and against the draft Constitution) and approximately 1.7 million for the Agrarian Party's candidates (and also against the draft Fundamental Law). Falsifications of a "new type" at the level of district electoral commissions and working groups of regional administrations: Artificial overstating of the voter turnout, ascribing of an additional number of votes to particular candidates or lists of candidates. Falsifications of this kind used to be virtually ruled out by the existence of an intermediate link -- rayon, city, and rayon-within-city electoral commissions, whose data were subject to mandatory publication in the local press. The abolition of this link, recorded in the president's Statute on Elections, gave the apparatus of district commissions and local administrations the totally unconstrained freedom to "edit" reports from the precincts according to their own political taste. For example, LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] Member Sokolov won in the single-seat District No. 113 in Troitsk, Moscow Oblast, where the scientific intelligentsia predominates. Instead of Shabad, who was running there for "Russia's Choice." In a check initiated by the democratic parties' activists, it was discovered that the LDPR and "Russia's Choice" had changed places in the final table: Somebody had swapped over the lines. Well, they might have made a mistake, for this does happen. But similar "slips" with target hits were also discovered in five out of six precincts checked in Tula Oblast and in Moscow Oblast's Podolskiy, Shchelkovskiy, and Orekhovo-Zuyevskiy Districts. Every mistake was in favor of the Communists, Agrarians, Zhirinovskiyites.... As though living up to their name, the electoral commissions made very selective mistakes. The experts believe that the LDPR received up to 6 million "extra" votes as a result of write-ups and the transposition of columns in the final returns, "Women of Russia" received approximately 1 million, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord approximately 0.5 million, and "Yabloko" roughly 0.2 million. At the same time "Russia's Choice" was approximately 2 million votes short as a result of transpositions of columns and the categorization of some of the voting papers cast for it as invalid. Mistakes and erasures in the summing up of the data of district and precinct electoral commissions by the CEC. The experts believe that such things were practised in the elections of Duma deputies for the federal district and in the vote on the draft Constitution. Otherwise why does the number of voters in a particular region in the CEC's final tables differ from the district commissions' data? In Krasnodar Kray, for example, this discrepancy amounted to 135,000 people. In Amur and Penza Oblasts an almost 100-percent voter turnout was recorded -- unprecedented even in the times of votes for candidates of the "inviolable bloc of Communists and nonparty people." At the same time the unprecedented activeness of citizens was here combined with their high literacy: There proved to be suspiciously few spoiled voting papers. "It need hardly be said," the experts argue, "that universal activeness combines with universal literacy only in one instance -- if in electoral precincts there is mass casting [dobros] of voting papers faultlessly filled out in favor of the desired parties and candidates. It is possible to judge which parties and candidates were desired by the electoral commissions in Penza Oblast rayons from the fact that there the LDPR was supported by a 30-40-percent majority, while `Russia's Choice' received less than 10 percent of the votes, and former Prosecutor Ilyukhin, now a member of the Communists' faction and chairman of the State Duma Security Committee, who was unknown to anyone there, got through in a single-seat district." The experts did not risk saying that all the falsifications and forgeries were carried out deliberately. They pointed out that a great deal happened here because of unprofessionalism and the CEC's arrogant overestimation of its own technical potential: "An example of such conduct is provided by the CEC's decision itself to sum up the voting results on party lists in Russia's 95,000 electoral precincts and by the subsequent muddle connected with the huge volume of data being processed and with the existence of a large number of returns lost on the way and filled out with serious mistakes. The CEC should have at least doubled its staff in order to make more precise the data of many thousands of precinct returns filled out with mistakes." But the following appears the most sensational discovery by Aleksandr Sobyanin and his colleagues: "In all, according to our estimates, 49 million of the 106.2 million registered voters actually participated in the 12 December vote, or 46.1 percent (instead of 58.2 million voters, or 54.8 percent according to the official data)." These figures are political dynamite. For, if just 46.1 percent of the electorate participated in the vote, then the Constitution was not adopted. It turns out that the reconstructed state edifice has no foundations. The activities of the president and the government, of the Duma and the Federation Council, the edicts, directives, and decrees adopted since December -- all are to be deemed invalid! Even given the present insuperable Russian craving for everything absurd, however, people will hardly be found who are willing to restore the pre-December status quo. The intransigent opposition? It is less inclined than anyone toward a revision of the referendum results, which would promise (if everything is deemed invalid, the amnesty too) Rutskoy, Anpilov, or Konstantinov a festive return to Lefortovo. At least, not one electoral bloc and not one political party has yet attempted to dispute the CEC's official data. But the experts continue to dispute them. They borrowed their research methods from the Italian sociologist Vilfredo Pareto. The famous Italian discovered mathematical correlations which make it possible to establish natural laws in the distribution of the number of residents in cities depending on their ordinal number on the list, the number of beasts of prey depending on their weight.... By using Pareto's charts with regard to voting results, Aleksandr Sobyanin and the Krasnoyarsk scientist Vladislav Sukhovolskiy, who helped him, discovered glaring deviations from the normal (if the elections were conducted honestly) trajectory. Let the specialists judge how correct such research is and how convincing the conclusions from it are. It will be useful for the reader to familiarize himself also with a different viewpoint. The fact that this viewpoint is exclusively departmental does not, I believe, reduce the need to expound it but, on the contrary, only increases it. CEC Chairman: "There Are No Grounds for Doubting the Voting Results" Does the CEC admit the very possibility of a falsification of the voting results as a consequence of political design or because of the incompetence of the commissions' members? "I cannot say that nothing like this happened," CEC Chairman Nikolay Ryabov answered me. "In Amur Oblast, for example, the electoral commission split up into political groupings. A falsication of the returns was recorded there. The case has gone to court." "Is this the only court case of this kind?" "No, 19 complaints about the actions of district electoral commissions have been examined in courts. Only five of them have been satisfied. Six complaints were lodged at the Supreme Court against the CEC, but just one has been satisfied. Thus, there are no grounds for speaking of large-scale falsifications and violations." Nikolay Ryabov also rejected the experts' allegation about an almost 100-percent turnout at electoral precincts in Amur and Penza Oblasts. According to official data, 60 percent of the electorate voted in Amur Oblast, and 64.4 percent in Penza Oblast. In addition, Ryabov confirmed the high competence of CEC apparatus staffers (although they were all evacuated to it from the Supreme Soviet apparatus and are not professionals in organizing and holding elections). The CEC chairman also swept aside the experts' suspicions concerning the extraordinary politicization of the new recruits who hold key posts in this department (although only quite recently CEC Secretary Ivan Galushko was an activist for the "Communists of Russia" faction, while Vladimir Okrut, CEC head of personnel, served as chief personnel manager in the Supreme Soviet and was one of those persons closest to Khasbulatov). "These people left the Supreme Soviet apparatus along with me," Ryabov said. He too, incidentally, hastily exchanged the post of deputy speaker for that of CEC chairman. "They made their choice and left the White House before 4 October. They certainly should not be suspected of disloyalty to the president, rather the opposite...." Answering a question about whether the experts had been carrying out anyone's political order by accusing the CEC of falsifications, Ryabov replied: "I do not want to think so. They were probably motivated by scientific ardor. They were in thrall to their own hypothesis, to prove which they scorned the obvious facts." The "Adventure" and Its Consequences Vasiliy Kazakov knowingly warned of the embarrassment that would inevitably result from these sudden, premature elections. Having continuously been the long-standing CEC chairman, who until the last days of his tenure of the post entrusted the counting of votes only to the beads of the office abacus or, in case of special emergency, to a calculating machine, he resolutely refused to head the new CEC, making a highly terse assessment of the short-distance (just two months) electoral race: "It is an adventure." The flaws of the present electoral system, which endowed the CEC and its local branches with unprecedented authority and considerable powers, have a congenital origin. The Statute on Elections to the Federal Assembly and the Basic Provisions on Elections to Representative Organs of Power did not appear just at any time but at the very height of the fall political clash, when the president was looking for support wherever he might find it. In the regions above all. The reward for this support was the right granted to the governors independently to decide on the election procedure in the province -- of which they are now making inventive use by returning the party and economic nomenklatura to power. The parties were also rewarded -- with a reduction in the number of signatures needed for a nomination from the 200,000 proposed by the draft's compilers to 100,000. This was why, while not having broad mass support, the contenders in the struggle for seats were essentially not political parties but, rather, departmental ones -- the State Committee for Nationalities Policy (Party of Russian Unity and Accord), the agro-industrial complex (Agrarian Party), veterans' organizations and the Committee in Defense of Peace ("Dignity and Charity").... The logical consequence of this departmental multiparty system fostered by the elections was the emergence in the Duma of such a faction as, let us say, "New Regional Policy," which represents the interests of major raw material producers, and other deputies' associations with clearly expressed lobbyist leanings. The electoral process -- it has already become continuous, like steelmaking -- is now governed by CEC officials. Not by law -- in view of its absence. But even the law "On Basic Guarantees of the Electoral Rights of Citizens of the Russian Federation" was prepared there, deep within the CEC. Its draft, which went to the State Duma Legislation Committee, was evaluated as follows by Vladimir Tumanov, a member of this committee and an authoritative jurist: "It is a draft law not on protection for voters' rights but on the electoral commissions' protection from voters." "Ministry of Democracy" Observers associate the CEC's concern at the increase in its departmental weight with the figure of its chairman, above all. It is possible to guess what kind of department, which merely serves the political process rather than determining it, Ryabov will now head, after his appreciable stay in the top echelon of the Russian nomenklatura. In the Kremlin table of ranks the post of CEC chairman takes a back seat, albeit an honorable one. Therefore Ryabov will definitely do everything to return to real politics. If his ambitions are not satisfied in the very near future with an appointment to some influential post, he will evidently endeavor to enlarge the scale of his present post. But this can only be done by expanding the volume of the CEC's functions and powers. Movement in this direction has already become apparent. Controlling the procedure, course, and, if the experts are to be believed, even the results of elections, having budget finances at its disposal, having branches in the province and a very experienced and, moreover, evidently not entirely impartial apparatus, and receiving prompt and extensive information on the electorate's mood and on the movement of the power elites, the CEC is gradually acquiring the features of an influential political department. We seem to underestimate the potential strength of this "ministry of democracy," which is able to bring to power any politician it likes through the voting booths.
