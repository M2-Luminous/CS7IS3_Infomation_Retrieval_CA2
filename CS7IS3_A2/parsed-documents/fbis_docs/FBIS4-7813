[NIN] Do you believe that the U.S. pressure, which resulted in the creation of a Muslim-Croat Federation, will have a crucial influence on the further progress of negotiations between Knin and Zagreb toward the establishment of (con)federal ties between the republic of Serbian Krajina and Croatia? [Martic] The United States has shown great decisiveness in taking over the key role in solving the crisis in the area of the former Yugoslavia. We expect an even more intense manifestation of the political and diplomatic strength of the U.S. Administration in the coming period. This will have the goal of securing a sphere of interest in these Balkan regions. One cannot say that this will not affect the course of negotiations between Croatia and Krajina. This tone was already evident during the first two rounds of negotiations that were conducted in Zagreb, and in this sense, the United States will try to keep the initiative. Of course, we also have Russia's significant role, because it does not wish to be left aside, but it is clear that at the moment the United States has the leading role. I think it is still too early to discuss in what way the U.S. diplomatic initiative can influence the solving of the Krajina's political status. This latest peace package has three levels of negotiations. We have practically solved the first one by signing the agreement on the cessation of hostilities. This should be followed by negotiations on economic cooperation and communications, while the solving of the Krajina's political status has been left for the end. We are ready to participate in all of these negotiations, in the same way that we are ready to accept everything that is not in contradiction with the basic stances of our people and the negotiating platform adopted by the assembly. In other words, the limit below which we will not go, not under any kind of pressure, is the people's right to self-determination, its confirmation in a referendum, that is, which can even be organized by the international community. [NIN] How do you explain the announcement that Croatia has received guarantees from the United States that it will manage to keep the Republic of Serbian Krajina within the borders of the former Socialist Republic of Croatia, and Charles Redman's statement that the United States would recognize Croatian in its AVNOJ [Antifascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia] borders? [Martic] The recognition of Croatia by the United States -- of which you speak -- is nothing new. Almost all European states have recognized Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina with their AVNOJ borders. Nevertheless, the Republic of Serbian Krajina has been functioning as an entirely independent and sovereign state for over three years. Or, to be more precise, there will be no lasting solution to the Croat-Krajina conflict until both sides devise a way of sitting down at the negotiating table, and, starting with the actual situation, try to find some kind of compromise solution. As far as we are concerned, we have no special demands on Croatia, and we are ready to cooperate with it in all spheres that do not threaten the vital interests of our people. [NIN] Do you believe that it is possible to solve the Krajina problem quickly and as part of the same package as Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Martic] At the moment, the most important thing is for the Croats to honor what they have signed in the Russian Embassy in Zagreb, and for peace to come to these areas. This will create conditions for negotiations of an economic and political nature. What the result of these negotiations will be does not depend only on us. [NIN] Do you believe that the establishment of communication links between Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is possible before a lasting political solution on the status of the Republic of Serbian Krajina is achieved? [Martic] I believe that the defined sequence of solving the Croat-Krajina conflict is conceptually wrong. The first phase must in any case be the end of the war and the establishment of lasting peace. Now that we have signed an agreement on the cessation of hostilities, and once we implement it, we need to immediately move on to solving the political relations between the Republic of Serbian Krajina and Croatia. Once this problem is solved, issues pertaining to economic cooperation and communications will not really present a problem. I have stressed on several occasions that there is no reason why the Republic of Serbian Krajina should not have cooperate well with all neighboring countries including Croatia, since this is in the interest of both sides. My only fear is that the sequence established now will result in new blockades and the creation of new crisis points. Experience has taught us that Croatia has so far always used forceful, unilateral solutions to undermine everything that has been accomplished regarding the solving of certain humanitarian problems. [NIN] How do you see the further progress of talks between Knin and Zagreb, and which points are currently the most controversial? [Martic] So far, we have no reason to be dissatisfied with the results. If the Croats comply with what was signed in the Russian Embassy in Zagreb, conditions will be created for lasting peace and the continuation of negotiations. We expect that the peace forces will soon take their positions on the demarcation line established by the maps and thus take over their real role. In the continuation of negotiations involving economic issues, we have our conditions that primarily concern the suspension of Security Council Resolution 820, which places the Krajina in total economic isolation. Because, you understand, there is no sense in negotiating about economic cooperation in conditions where we are not allowed to import or export, which, in turn, calls into question the state's economic survival. [NIN] How would you assess the current political situation in the republic of Serbian Krajina in view of the fact that the parliamentary majority has not accepted your proposal that Borislav Mikelic be the future prime minister? [Martic] I believe that we are in for a period of more stable internal relations. The temperature was quite high at the beginning of the work of the parliament, as a result of the accumulated political tensions from the time before the elections and during the first and second electoral rounds. The climate is gradually changing and as you have had the chance to hear, a compromise on the future composition of the government has already been reached. The coalition of the Serbian Democratic Party of Krajina and the Serbian Radical Party has already accepted the proposal that the prime minister designate should be Borislav Mikelic. He is currently conducting all the necessary consultations concerning the composition of the future government with representatives of all political parties, and I am convinced that it will all end in the best possible way. [NIN] In Belgrade, your statements are interpreted as a hint that the parliament will be dissolved. Is that at all possible? [Martic] My address to the public had only one goal -- to point out the possible consequences of a considerably destructive trend in the work of the parliament and to accentuate the necessity of accepting the concept of national unity. Because, after all, the republic of Serbian Krajina is at war, and we cannot duplicate on our political scene models that are valid in states that have had peace for a long time and where the parliamentary life is developed. My address to the people and the deputies did not have any other allusions. [NIN] To what extent do internal disagreements weaken the position of the republic of Serbian Krajina? [Martic] I have already said that these disagreements are of a temporary nature and therefore cannot significantly weaken the position of the republic of Serbian Krajina. There is complete political consensus on certain global issues that concern the future status of our state. This is evident in the good cooperation of the parliamentary committee for foreign affairs and the foreign ministry with the negotiating team that participated in the negotiations in Zagreb. [NIN] Is there truth in the complaints that the important cadre positions have been taken by the supporters of members of the League of Communists -- Movement for Yugoslavia, which to a certain extent circumvents the electoral results? [Martic] I do not know where such stories originate or whom they concretely concern. It is known that so far only the assembly has been constituted, and that everything was done in accordance with the wishes of the coalition. The government still has not been formed, and electoral results will most certainly be taken into account when choosing cabinet ministers. Therefore, it is clear that these are just rumors. [NIN] Do you believe that it will be possible in due course to reintegrate Yugoslavia in the form of a confederacy, a union, or a third entity? [Martic] I do not believe that it will be possible to create a new Yugoslavia that would be comprised of former republics, again linked through political links. It is to be expected that after the war is over, economic, communication, and even cultural links will be reestablished in the area of the former Yugoslavia. The strength of these links will depend on the international community's disposition toward solving political relations, that is, its readiness to apply the same standards to all the participants in the crisis in former Yugoslavia. I wish to stress once more that we ask for nothing more than what the same international community has granted the other peoples in former Yugoslavia, and that is to enable us -- in accordance with the strictest criteria -- to exercise our right to self-determination.
