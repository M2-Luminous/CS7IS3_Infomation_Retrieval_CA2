FR940630-1-00021 FR940630-1-00005 The SIP includes a commitment to develop the procedures document which will detail the specifics of the implementation of the oversight program by the fall of 1994. The SIP includes a commitment to submit this procedures document as an amendment to the SIP. EPA proposes conditional approval of the Pennsylvania SIP with the condition that the Commonwealth meet its commitment that the motorist compliance enforcement program oversight procedures manual be submitted as a SIP amendment within one year from the date of publication of the Federal Register notice which conditionally approves the SIP. Quality Assurance_40 CFR Part 51.363 An ongoing quality assurance program shall be implemented to discover, correct and prevent fraud, waste, and abuse in the program. The program shall include covert and overt performance audits of the inspectors, audits of station and inspector records, equipment audits, and formal training of all state I/M enforcement officials and auditors. A description of the quality assurance program which includes written procedure manuals on the above discussed items must be submitted as part of the SIP. The Pennsylvania submittal describes the quality assurance program and includes regulations and supporting documents which describe procedures for implementing inspector, records and equipment audits as well as providing formal training to all Commonwealth enforcement officials. Performance audits of inspectors will consist of both covert and overt audits. The SIP states that a quality assurance procedure manual is under development which will be consistent with federal regulation and will include written procedures for performing covert and overt audits. EPA interprets this as a commitment to develop the procedures manual and submit it to EPA as a SIP revision. EPA proposes to conditionally approve the SIP based on its finding that the SIP meets the quality assurance requirements of the federal regulation with the condition that the Commonwealth meet its commitment that the quality assurance program procedures manual will be submitted as a SIP amendment within one year from the date of publication of the Federal Register notice which conditionally approves the SIP. Enforcement Against Contractors, Stations and Inspectors_40 CFR Part 51.364 Enforcement against licensed stations, contractors and inspectors shall include swift, sure, effective, and consistent penalties for violation of program requirements. The federal I/M regulation requires the establishment of minimum penalties for violations of program rules and procedures which can be imposed against stations, contractors and inspectors. The legal authority for establishing and imposing penalties, civil fines, license suspensions and revocations must be included in the SIP. State quality assurance officials shall have the authority to temporarily suspend station and/or inspector licenses immediately upon finding a violation that directly affects emission reduction benefits, unless constitutionally prohibited. An official opinion explaining any state constitutional impediments to immediate suspension authority must be included in the submittal. The SIP shall describe the administrative and judicial procedures and responsibilities relevant to the enforcement process, including which agencies, courts and jurisdictions are involved, who will prosecute and adjudicate cases and the resources and sources of those resources which will support this function. The Pennsylvania submittal includes the legal authority to establish and impose penalties against stations, contractors and inspectors. The penalty schedules for inspectors and stations which are found in the Commonwealth's regulation meet the federal I/M regulation requirements and are approvable. The penalty schedule for contractors is approvable with one contingency. 67 PA Code ยง178.602(b), entitled Schedule of Penalties for Emission Inspection Contractors, states that ``the contractor shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Contractor Responsibility Program and may be subject to penalties and sanctions thereunder in addition to or in lieu of those imposed under this section or the contract''. The Contractor Responsibility Program (CRP) is not a statute but rather a Governors' Office Management Directive and is found in the SIP in Addendum I of the RFP. The Management Directive does not list specific monetary penalties to be assessed to the contractor but rather provides for suspension or debarment of the contractor. EPA is concerned that the penalties imposed under the CRP could be less stringent than those in the Commonwealth's I/M regulation. The Commonwealth has indicated that it intends to use this authority only to impose penalties that are more stringent than those in the Commonwealth's regulation. Therefore, EPA is proposing to approve the penalty schedule against contractors which is found in section 178.602(b) of the Commonwealth's regulation with the contingency that penalties assessed against the contractor under the CRP in lieu of the penalties in the Commonwealth's I/M regulation must be equal to or more stringent than those in the Commonwealth's I/M regulation. However, should Pennsylvania at any time assess penalties less stringent than those in the regulation EPA will rescind its approval and disapprove the SIP.
