The "Hands-off-Kashmir" resolution was adopted 24 hours after the President, Dr Shankar Dayal Sharma, in his address to the joint session of the two Houses of Parliament had warned that "any attempt to destabilise India either from across the border or from any other quarter would be foiled." Consistent with reiterating that Jammu and Kashmir "has been, is, and shall remain" an integral part of India, asserted that India had the will and capacity to firmly counter all designs against its unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity. The motion, read out by the presiding officers of both Houses, was passed without any discussion to the thumping of desks, showing that all the political parties were with the government on this issue. The two-page resolution demanded that Pakistan vacate areas of the Indian State, which they have occupied through aggression and regretted the pitiable conditions and violations of human rights and denial of democratic rights and freedom to the people in the area. The strongly-worded resolution charged Pakistan with abetting terrorism in the Indian State through imparting training to terrorists in camps located in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), supply of weapons and funds and assistance to the terrorists infiltrating into the Valley with the avowed purpose of creating disorder, disharmony and subversion. The resolution called upon Islamabad to put an end to these activities forthwith. These activities were in violation of the Shimla agreement, the internationally accepted norms of inter-State conduct and the Geneva declaration to which Pakistan is a signatory. Stating that this was the root cause of tension between the two countries, the resolution declared that the Indian political and democratic structures and the Constitution provided for firm guarantees for the promotion and protection of human rights of all its citizens. There had been much concern in political circles at the recent attempts by Pakistan to internationalise the Kashmir issue. The concern was voiced at the two rounds of meetings the Parliamentary Affairs Minister, Mr V.C. Shukla, held with leaders of different political parties in Parliament last week. The main Opposition party in Parliament, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which first broached the subject, had informed the minister of its proposal to move a resolution in this regard. Following expression of similar sentiments from other parties, it was felt that they should all be part to a single resolution so as to send the proper signals across the border. Differences, however, cropped up about the wording of the resolution, with the National Front and Left parties insisting that the United States be identified by name for its role in the matter of terrorism in Kashmir. Unanimity also eluded the leaders on the question of adopting the resolution without a discussion in the event of it being a government-sponsored one. It was then decided that the resolution be moved by the Speaker in the Lok Sabha and the Chairman in the Rajya Sabha. The resolution, which incorporates the views and feelings of all the parties, does not, however, identify the United States by name. Following is the text of the resolution: This House notes with deep concern Pakistan's role in imparting training to the terrorists in camps located in Pakistan and Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK), the supply of weapons and funds, assistance in infiltration of trained terrorists, including foreign mercenaries into Jammu and Kashmir with the avowed purpose of creating disorder, disharmony and subversion: --reiterates that the terrorists trained in Pakistan are indulging in murder, loot and other heinous crimes against the people taking them hostage and creating an atmosphere of terror; --condemns strongly the continued abetment and encouragement Pakistan is extending to subversive and terrorist activities in the Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir; --calls upon Pakistan to stop forthwith its support to terrorism, which is in violation of the Shimla agreement, the internationally accepted norms of inter-State conduct and the Geneva declaration to which Pakistan is a signatory. This is in fact the root cause of tension between the two countries; --reiterates that the Indian political and democratic structures and the Constitution provide for firm guarantees for the promotion and protection of human rights of all its citizens; --regards Pakistan's anti-India campaign of calumny and falsehood as unacceptable and deplorable; --notes with deep concern the highly provocative statements emanating from Pakistan and urges Pakistan to refrain from making statements which vitiate the atmosphere; --expresses regret and concern at the pitiable conditions and violations of human rights and denial of democratic rights and freedom of the people in those areas of the Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir, which are under the illegal occupation of Pakistan; --firmly reiterates, on behalf of the people of India, that: (a) The State of Jammu and Kashmir has been, is, and shall be an integral part of India and any attempts to separate it from the rest of the country will be resisted by India by all necessary means; (b) India has the will and capacity to firmly counter all designs against its unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity; (c) Pakistan should vacate the areas of the Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir, which they have occupied through aggression; (d) Any attempt from any quarter to interfere in the internal affairs of India will be met resolutely.
