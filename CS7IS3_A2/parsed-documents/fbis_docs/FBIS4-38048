Defence Ministry officials were at pains to stress on Thursday [23 June] that no shopping list for arms had been submitted to the Prime Minister. "Prime Ministers do not go around looking at fighter planes" said a senior official. In similar vein, officials said no final decision had been taken to include Defence Secretary K.A. Nambiar in the Prime Minister's entourage. The list of officials would be finalised by June 27, that is two days before P.V. Narasimha Rao enplanes for Moscow. Working groups comprising officials from the defence ministry and the PMO [Prime Minister's Office] are currently settling the loose ends, officials said. The change of tack follows close on the heels of reports that India and Russia were about to assume the strong defence relationship that was the centre-piece of Indo-Soviet relations. The visits of the respective service chiefs of the two countries culminating in joint naval exercises earlier this year had raised eyebrows in several capitals. The Government in fact had taken the position that the exercises were decided at the last minute following a Russian offer, but that explanation satisfied few countries in the neighbourhoods, particularly the South East Asian nations. In addition,the renewed uncertainty over the F-16s transfer to Pakistan has its fall-out over India's responses. To this extent the tentative decision to buy 20-odd MiG 29M is being projected as part of the normal fleet renewal process, rather than as a force augmentation. In any event, the deal for the additional fighter planes is not expected to be signed during Rao's trip. The attempt to underplay the defence angle to the Russian visit comes at a time when the hosts themselves have launched an arms hard-sell including opening up their front-line Su-30 fighter aircraft. While the Russians have turned their full sights to India in their arms marketing strategy for South Asia, the Indian defence establishment would like the Government to keep its options open. The IAF [Indian Air Force] is keen that the Government closely examine its proposal for two more squadrons of the air superiority French Mirage 2000 as an answer to the F-16s. While the MiG-29 is basically an air defence fighter, the F-16 and the Mirage 2000 are multi-role warplanes, capable of defending air space as well as launching strikes. The straws of a potentially significant military relationship building up from the rubble of the Soviet Union are however clearly visible, despite the Government's protestations. A joint venture deal for servicing the Mig-21 series not only operated by the IAF but other air forces in this part of the world is seen as a tactical move by both partners. Commercial interests apart, IAF would be in a better position to handle its spares problem once the Russians set up service centres here. In similar vein, their offer to set up an assembly line for production of the Su-30 is considered significant, tactically, although there are reservations in the IAF over its integration into the fleet.
