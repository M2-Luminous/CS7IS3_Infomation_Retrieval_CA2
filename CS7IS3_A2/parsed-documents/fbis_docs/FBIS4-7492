It was the first economic meeting since 1989 with the participation of commanders of all military districts and of commanders of all types of the Armed Forces. Acting Finance Minister Henryk Chmielak, who took part in the meeting, argued that the Defense Ministry's budget is a result of a "difficult compromise," but the military present at the meeting were of the view that it is the Army that is the victim of the compromise. Gen. Zalewski argued that it would be easy to help the Army by limiting tax levels because it is "illogical for the Army to put money back into the budget and then use this same money." The officers argued that the Army finds it hard to adapt to the market economy. They complained of a lack of laws that would make it possible for the Army to sell unused buildings, storage areas, or garages, while there is no money to continue to maintain the premises. The topic of wasting resources in military housing, revealed by the Supreme Chamber of Control, was discussed repeatedly. According to the general cadre, "deficiencies of human nature" were the main reason for what happened. The logistics chief assured that clearing up the issue completely and bringing the guilty to justice is in the Army's interest.
