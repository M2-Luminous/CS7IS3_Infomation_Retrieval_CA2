FR940505-1-00019 FR940505-1-00010 The agency has addressed the issue of the ISO symbol previously. For instance, in a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) for proposed Standard No. 135, which provides for harmonization of international standards for passenger car hydraulic brake systems (see 56 FR 30528, July 3, 1991), the agency stated that it had denied several petitions for inconsequential noncompliance based on the use of ISO symbols in place of words or symbols required by Standard No. 101. In those cases, the agency stated in the SNPRM, it had believed the meaning of the ISO symbols would be unclear or ambiguous to drivers. Additionally, the agency conducted a rulemaking proceeding between 1982 and 1987 in which the agency amended Standard No. 101 by permitting various words and symbols to be used, while rejecting others. In a NPRM (47 FR 49994, November 4, 1982), the agency discussed allowing the ISO symbol for brake failure, and sought comment. It noted that the symbol for brakes was of ``particular safety importance'' to drivers, and stated the agency's concern that ``the symbol may not be immediately recognizable.'' Two years later, in a final rule (49 FR 30191, July 27, 1984), the agency expressed its concern that ``too many symbols, or symbols that are not easily recognizable, are not in the public's or industry's interest.'' The agency delayed a decision on brake failure warning indicators in that final rule, addressing them instead in another final rule issued a year later (50 FR 23426, June 4, 1985). The agency rejected use of the ISO symbol in the 1985 rule based on a study published by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). That study found the percentage recognition or understanding of the ISO brake symbol among a survey sample of people unfamiliar with that symbol to be very low (i.e., about one-quarter of the survey sample). By comparison, 87 percent of the survey sample recognized the meaning of the word ``brake'' when it was illuminated. In addition, a comment from General Motors stated that the ISO was adopting new symbols by consensus and without resort to its prior practice of extensive international testing as to the symbol's recognizability and suitability. In a final rule published on May 28, 1987 (52 FR 19872), the agency declined to adopt the ISO symbol as an alternative to the words ``Antilock'' or ``ABS'', once again citing the SAE study discussed above. In all of the above final rules, the agency discussed the desirability of increased harmonization of symbols and words as a way to eliminate language barriers and decrease manufacturer costs. However, notwithstanding its general wish to increase harmonization, NHTSA has consistently deemed it prudent to reject symbols and words that could have a negative safety impact, whether in the short run during a transitional period of familiarization or in the long run. In its petition, VW stated it was not aware of any definitive studies showing the need for a 1/8-inch minimum height requirement for lettering on indicator lamps. VW maintained that the slightly smaller letters it requested in its petition, combined with the slightly larger ISO symbol, would be sufficient to convey the intended meaning (i.e., brake failure) to the driver of a vehicle. VW points to FMVSS 208 (Occupant Crash Protection), S4.5.1, which requires occupant crash protection maintenance schedules to be permanently affixed on a label inside the vehicle, as permitting letters of 3/32-inch high. 3/32-inch (or 2.4 mm) is insignificantly larger than the 2.2 mm letter height that VW says would fit inside the 7 mm ISO symbol. NHTSA disagrees with VW's statement that decreasing the minimum letter height would have no effect on a driver's ability to understand the warning indicator. Contrary to VW's assertion that there is no definitive study showing the need for a 1/8-inch minimum height requirement, NHTSA research report, ``Specification of Control Illumination Limits'' (DOT&hyph;HS&hyph;4&hyph;00864, 1974) found that instrument-panel labels consisting of .09 inch letters (2.3 mm, or 0.1 mm smaller than that requested by VW) could not be read by older drivers, regardless of letter brightness or background contrast. VW has provided no data supporting its contention that a letter height of 2.4 mm would be readable by all drivers, including older drivers. The agency also takes issue with the comparison of the letter height requirements of FMVSS 105 and those of FMVSS 208. The words required under FMVSS 105 warn of an impending or actual failure in the brake system of the vehicle. The indicator light in this situation must be seen and understood by all drivers in all lighting conditions as quickly as possible. In an emergency situation involving brake failure, the agency believes that it would be the word, ``antilock'' or the letters ``ABS'' that would convey the desired message. If the minimum height of the letters were reduced to the point of illegibility, the successful communication of the message would rest solely on the accompanying ISO symbol. NHTSA believes that the symbol would not be adequate by itself to alert many drivers to the occurrence of brake failure. The wording required by FMVSS 208 is a standard and permanent notice of maintenance. It is a reminder to the vehicle owner when to have the occupant crash protection system serviced. It need not be seen and immediately understood, as with a warning indicator. The two requirements are obviously for different purposes and to be read at different times. Therefore, they need not have identical letter height requirements. NHTSA has no objection to use of the ISO symbol, per se. However, the ISO symbol may only be used as an addition to the words or acronym required by FMVSS's 101 and 105 and not as a substitute. VW may, if it so chooses, meet the requirements of FMVSS 105 by including ``ABS'' inside the ISO symbol for brake failure, provided that the letters ``ABS'' are 1/8-inch in height. Alternatively, it may place the word ``antilock'' or letters ``ABS'', in compliance with the requirements of FMVSS's 101 and 105, next to a 1/8-inch ISO symbol brake failure indicator. Both options would meet the requirements of CMVSS 101 and the FMVSS's 101 and 105, obviating the need for VW to install different components in vehicles sold in the U.S. or Canada. Based on the foregoing, NHTSA concludes that there is no reasonable possibility that the requested amendment would be issued at the conclusion of a rulemaking proceeding and therefore denies VW's petition.
