They stated this today at the end of their talks. The aim of the exercises is to enhance the ability of the two countries' armies to cooperate during peacekeeping operations. The exercises will be the first experience of major armed cooperation between the UK and Russian armed forces since the World War II. The exercises will be "of both military and political significance." As such they will be completely in keeping with the spirit of the idea of "partnership for peace" proposed at the NATO summit in Brussels in January 1994.
