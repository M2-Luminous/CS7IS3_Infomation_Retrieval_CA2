Based on the meanings of the Roman numbers, it predicted that, after the Sixth Party Congress, life would be happy. This folk saying fully reflects the people's dream and absolute belief in the success of the renovation undertaking initiated and lead by our party. That belief is the foundation for our political stabilization; and political stabilization is a prerequisite for socioeconomic stabilization and development. By the end of 1993, we had covered exactly half the term of the Seventh Party Congress. What can be said about the work? In retrospect, we remember that at the middle of the year we used to readjust our planning so as to lower our targets. This was in order to allow us to achieve something by the end of the year. Now, difficulties, obstacles, and dangers still exist. But in only three years, we have accomplished many jobs planned for five years. Is this not a fine characteristic of the new stage? On hearing that the world hailed our government's good economic management, an economist made a nice but hardly surprising statement: The cutting down of the inflation rate from 57.6 percent to 4 percent within a period of three years is not an easy job for any country. He also added: As an insider, sometimes we cannot fully realize the significance of our work. However, outsiders can see more clearly when they compare our achievement with the real situation in the world. As a matter of fact, five years ago nobody in the world thought that Vietnam would survive when the USSR and European socialist countries collapsed. Nobody thought that Vietnam's poor, backward agriculture, permeated with continuous natural disasters, would become the world's third biggest rice exporter. Nobody foresaw that the 500-kilovolt National Transmission Line -- which foreign specialists said that would only appear in Vietnam after the year 2000 -- would come into existence and start operating in the early second quarter of this year. Somebody said that if wage reform is applied when the economy is still in crisis, chaos will follow and inflation will increase. That prediction has been totally discredited by the real situation of 1993. These fine things have happened against the background of many changes in the world. Should we not be proud of ourselves? Life is like a difficult mathematical problem. When we do not try to solve it, we think it impossible to solve; but when we start doing it, especially when we have completed one calculation, the possibility of solving the problem will appear clearer, giving us more confidence and energy to finish it. Another interesting thing is that not only mathematicians understand this. As the economist has stated, it is certain that it was not diplomatic politeness which directed the world's two monetary organizations to appraise Vietnam as the best economically managed country in Asia for 1992. It is also not coincidental that the Donors' Conference in Paris was so successful. And recently, the Paris Credit Club of 11 developed countries, including the United States, decided to reduce Vietnam's debts by 50 percent and grant Vietnam extra time to repay its debts -- in 23 years' time. We highly evaluate, treasure, and appreciate the support of the world community for our national construction undertaking. We also clearly realize and correctly evaluate our achievements. Nobody is fool enough to pour money into a bottomless pit. Nobody wants to deposit one dong to recover just one dong. And nobody wants to invest in a country with a chaotic political situation, where different parties and groups are fighting for more power in parliament rather than striving to improve the national economy. The economic development and political stabilization in our country in the past years have helped us to create this opportunity. They also prove the correctness of an important concept in our party renovation line for national construction: that is, accumulations must be obtained mainly from our internal economy. External factors are very important, but internal ones are more significant in creating an economic impact. We must strive to develop our economy while step by step improving our people's daily life, strengthening national defense, ensuring political security, and maintaining stability in order to further develop. We must also strive to open our door so as to promote relations with foreign countries and to learn from their experiences while consistently defending our national independence and sovereignty, and formulating correct lines and policies in conformity with our country's conditions and our people's aspirations. These are the great tasks that we must satisfactorily carry out. With this as a reality, His Excellency Lee Kuan Yew, a renowned strategic development planner in Singapore, recently spoke to Western newsmen about Vietnam's current development, saying that the matter does not depend on the one party or multiparty system but rather on the leadership's ability to develop the national economy. It is not too much of an exaggeration to say that one of the Vietnamese people's significant contributions to mankind's development in the post Cold War period is that differences in ideology and political systems are simply not the cause of hostility and an uncooperative atmosphere among nations. Today Vietnam is a socialist country that enjoys relations with 167 countries in the world. Whether we choose to adopt a conservative or progressive stand, we are ready to join the international community while maintaining our own political system. Thus far, we have completed the first half of the Seventh Party National Congress' term. The remaining second half is very promising, yet with immense obstables. The new era will also bring new difficulties and ordeals. While we are seeking investment capital for development, we must strive to map out plans to use this capital in the most effective way. In the past, we strove to extricate our country from encirclement and isolation; now we are striving to open our door while maintaining our national characteristics. In the past, we strove to attain a firm economic foothold; we are now working hard to maintain our economic growth. In the past, we also experienced corruption and smuggling. These and other social vices are now developing and becoming serious while laws and discipline are loosely observed. In the past we worked hard to produce enough grain for our own consumption; we now talk about how to sell more rice at higher prices and how to narrow the gap between peasants in the rural and mountain regions and people in the city; how to eliminate the division between the rich and the poor caused by the market economy; how to firmly maintain the ideal objectives charted by our party and state; and how to cope with hostilities carried out by reactionaries at home and abroad. However, these difficulties and ordeals cannot be resolved overnight. It is necessary to say that while there are changes for the better in society, our infrastructures are still poor and backward. More than two million city dwellers are unemployed; more than 200,000 prostitutes have not been reeducated; 70,000 drug addicts have not been cured; AIDS is increasing; and so forth. We cannot belittle this situation in our country, but we must stay calm while finding ways and means to step by step resolve these issues with confidence. This is the correct attitude for coping with difficulties. In the upcoming Vietnamese Lunar New Year, people in Hanoi and Haiphong as well as the Vietnamese community in Moscow will have the chance to enjoy Tam San rice fragrant rice, the renowned traditional rice of Nam Ha province, packed in beautiful plastic bags -- the new product of the Hanoi Export-Import Corporation Union, which will be put on sale at home and abroad during the New Year. The corporation director said that if we want to compete in the world rice market, we must plant and sell our traditional good quality rice such as the Tam San and Nep Tam San [fragrant sticky rice] and so forth, which were not promoted in the recent past. To restore the planting of these varieties of rice, we must find the markets and invest money to produce seeds, zone off planting areas, restore the traditional method of cultivation, and improve processing and management in accordance with modern technological systems so as to attain the highest economic result. There are currently new things in our society. However, in daily life we sometime need the old things. If we can restore the old things we need with the application of modern technology, we will obtain a better result.
