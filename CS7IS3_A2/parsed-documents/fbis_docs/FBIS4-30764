For example, according to the Inspection Office, it paid its U.S. advisers in a manner at variance with its regulations and, despite its directives, it paid bonuses to its staff. Embezzlement is not involved, however. Zdenek Smelik, a member of the inspection unit that supervised the inspection at the Ministry, described these shortcomings as a failure to comply fully with the regulations and administrative obligations. On the other hand, Lubomir Netolicky, the head of the Ministry's Office, said that he considers the proceedings instituted by the NKU to be the mechanical application of generally binding legal regulations and the one-sided interpretation of the stipulations of certain laws. The NKU report described as the biggest mistake the fact that the Ministry used more than Kc0.5 million from the National Property Fund. The fund's Presidium had transferred the money to the Privatization Ministry in the years 1991-93, despite the fact that the law does not permit such transactions. According to the Inspection Office, the Ministry paid its 80 staff a total of Kc700,000 in the form of personal bonuses from the funds that the government had allocated to Skalicky's ministry. "A personal bonus should be paid from this money to the 16 members of staff who are entrusted with the most demanding tasks, who compile and evaluate the materials, and who achieve excellent results," said Smelik. By using the money for a different purpose, the Ministry has violated the decree on managing resources from the state budget. Netolicky said, however, that the details about assigning the money for 16 members of staff had been laid down only tentatively.
