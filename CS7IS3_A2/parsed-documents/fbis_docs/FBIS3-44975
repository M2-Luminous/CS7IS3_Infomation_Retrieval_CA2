We will be facing very arduous tasks in our way to reform and development. To unite and lead the broad masses of people toward this end, our leading cadres at all levels must cultivate a new spirit and a new work style. Comrade Jiang Zemin recently repeatedly emphasized: "I hope everybody can spare a little more time for studying, reduce social appointments, conduct more investigations and studies to avoid subjectivism, and do more practical work while refraining from uttering empty words." This is the good style that we should vigorously promote in the new year. Constantly enriching one's knowledge and ability, studying more, doing more investigations and studies, and doing more practical work, all these aspects are linked to each other, and none of them is dispensable. Of them the first task is to study. Through studying we can constantly obtain new knowledge, increase our ability, enhance our ideological and political understanding as well as professional competence, and do practical work in a better and more effective manner. Nowadays, most leading cadres are aware of the importance of studying and they always keep an eye on it. However, still there are some comrades who do not attach enough importance to study--they either spend much time on processing documents and attending meetings, or indulge themselves in all kinds of social life. They are busy in welcoming visiting guests and seeing them off, accompanying visitors to banquets and on tours. They are present on every occasion and meeting, accompanying and seeing off visiting superiors, foreign guests, visitors from other parts of the country and from other related organizations. They believe missing any such single occasion will imply "a lack of politeness." Perhaps you may expect that people are less fussy when dealing with those within their own areas and systems? But you will soon find that you are wrong. Unit A may invite you to deliver a speech at a gathering to celebrate the successful completion of some project, and you will have to go; unit B may invite you to attend and address an anniversary party, and you cannot turn it down; unit C may request that you preside over a foundation stone laying ceremony, and you cannot but accept it; unit D may invite you to cut the ribbon at an inaugural ceremony, and still you will have to attend it... anyone whose invitation is turned down by you will complain that you "are ignoring" them. So, you are busy with social appointments all day long and you can hardly concentrate on work and study. For a few comrades, although they appear to be complaining about the loss of too much time on boring social functions, they actually are very fond of these activities. Still worse is that they may expect others to entertain them in such a fussy manner when they visit other organizations and, in particular, their subordinate organs, otherwise they will be very unhappy or will go off in a huff. Thus, a "social life circle" is formed where everybody tries to please each other by inviting each other to or attending social functions. So everybody has to spend time and energy on arranging excessive social life. Many people may even have to rack their brains to work out the arrangement of seats around the dining table. This is not only a great waste but also a silly practice. Nowadays as the closed and rigid old structure has been broken in the wake of reform and opening-up, every locality, department, and organization has established many more external ties, and the sense of public relations has been greatly enhanced among people. So some social appointments are inevitable, some even have become an integral part of work. The point is that these activities must be arranged in an appropriate and efficient way. Principal leading cadres, in particular, should try their best to minimize social appointments, or to authorize someone else to attend to such social functions on behalf of them. They should learn to emancipate themselves from excessive social functions and trivial formalities, so they can devote more time to reading books and acquiring more new knowledge. What is to be studied? For the moment, we must first conscientiously study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and thus further prepare ourselves with Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. This is the basis on which we rely for keeping a firm stand, distinguishing right from wrong, blazing new trails, and establishing ourselves in an unassailable position. Under the guidance of this theory, we must bear in mind the party's basic line of "one center, two basic points," and study and implement well the party's major guiding principles and policies. For the time being, we must particularly devote more time to studying and implementing the decision adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, read more books on basic theories of the market economy, and thus make contributions to the establishment of the socialist market economic structure. "Knowledge is power." Therefore, apart from studying theories and policies, our leading cadres must also work hard to acquire knowledge of modern economy, science and technology, law, sociology, and other related fields. Some comrades think studying is not so important to them since they have received formal education, and they believe their knowledge and professional standards are high enough. To be sure, since we have been applying the principle of "four transformations" to employment of cadres over the past 10 years or more, most leading cadres selected and promoted from all levels nowadays are of higher academic qualifications and higher professional standards. However, appointment can only vest an individual with power and duties but will not automatically increase his knowledge and ability. The appointed person's special qualifications may not necessarily suit the needs of his present post, and the knowledge he obtained in the past may not necessarily apply to the present and future circumstances. We are now in an era of "knowledge explosion." We will be able to keep up with the times and constantly improve our leadership standards only if we keep on studying hard, seeking new knowledge, and improving ourselves. Of course, learning does not mean learning only from books but also from practice, and from the masses and other comrades as well. So long as our leading comrades at all levels keep a high sense of study, make the best use of their time to study, and keep the whole leading bodies study very hard, then it will be very hopeful for us to further improve our work and open up a new prospect.
