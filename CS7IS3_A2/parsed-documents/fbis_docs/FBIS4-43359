According to initial projections that were circulated in the early afternoon, the LSAP [Socialist Workers' Party of Luxembourg] was to suffer a crushing defeat and the DP [Democratic Party] was to record a landslide gain. The sober verdict of the electorate was quite different. Both the CSV [Christian Social People's Party] and the LSAP suffered slight losses throughout the country, which cost the two governing parties one seat each, but the Liberals did not achieve the breakthrough they had hoped for--they merely consolidated their 12th seat, which Josy Simon's defection had already secured for them a year ago. The "Greens" turned gray out of sheer disappointment when they received only five instead of the 10 to 11 seats they had hoped for. The Communist Party and New Left were cast into the political wilderness where they join the National Movement. The ADR [Action Committee for Democracy and Pension Fairness], with its populist pension claims, achieved a reasonable success which the next government ought to build on in order to deal with this important question of basic justice. Otherwise, it was a quiet election day in Luxembourg, one which caused the international agencies, in view of the perceived stability, to forecast a continuation of the present coalition. We must wait and see.
