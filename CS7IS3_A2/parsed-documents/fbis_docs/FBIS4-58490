FBIS4-58490 "drnes087yy_94009" FBIS-NES-94-087 Daily Report 5 May 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Arab-Israeli Talks PLO Cancels Contracts With Israeli Companies PLO Cancels Contracts With Israeli Companies TA0505092094 Tel Aviv DAVAR in Hebrew 5 May 94 p 1 TA0505092094 Tel Aviv DAVAR Hebrew BFN [Report by Mikhal Sela' and On Levi] [Text] The PLO has ordered the cancellation of all contractual relationships between Civil Administration bodies in Gaza and Jericho and Israeli companies and public organizations. If this order is followed, the Palestinians in Gaza and Jericho might find themselves cut off from the supply of essential basic services, such as electricity, water, medication, gasoline, food products, and other essential consumption goods. The Israeli delegation to the talks on civilian issues was notified of the move by Attorney Jamil al-Tarifi, head of the corresponding Palestinian delegation. DAVAR learned this from senior members of the Israeli delegation. The order came as an unpleasant surprise to the Israeli delegation and caused grave concern regarding the immediate future. The Civil Administration had asked to hand over the management of the affairs under its jurisdiction in an orderly manner that would include an overlap and transfer of the services it currently provides to the residents of Gaza and Jericho. Furthermore, according to the agreements in principle, the Civil Administration system was supposed to be handed over to the Palestinians in its entirety and continue working in its present form. According to the Palestinian development plan, changes in this system were to be made gradually, based on available budgets. The Israeli delegates proposed that the contracts be canceled in a few months, after the autonomy administration begins operating and is well established, but the Palestinians rejected the proposal. In view of this, all suppliers and companies with which the Civil Administration had contractual relations have been notified that their contracts will be terminated as of 17 May. The residents of the territories, who know that there are no other sources that can provide the services, were also surprised by the order. In discussions with them, it became apparent that Palestinians from outside the territories who are participating in the talks on civilian issues do not have the slightest idea about how life is run in the territories. For example, the Palestinians from outside the territories did not know that all electrical power in the territories comes from Israel. The contracts in question provide the legal framework for the establishment of business ties between residents of the territories and Israeli suppliers, through the Civil Administration. The supply of power to Gaza, for example, is based on a contract between the Israel Electric Corporation and the municipalities and local councils in the Gaza Strip, according to which those bodies and not private persons are the "consumers" of the service. If these contracts are terminated before an alternative source of power is found, Gaza will be left without electricity. It was learned yesterday that, after they realized that it might cause distress in the coming several weeks, members of the Palestinian delegation expressed regret over their decision to cancel the contracts. Nonetheless, the contracts were not renewed and no new ones have been signed.
