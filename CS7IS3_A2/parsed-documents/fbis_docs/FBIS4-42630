According to the latest opinion poll carried out by DER SPIEGEL magazine, Rau was supported by 54 percent of poll repondents, and Herzog by only 20 percent. This was the price paid for the indirect presidential election, sanctioned by the German Basic Law of 1949. This solution was chosen because of the negative experience with the Weimar Republic, when Paul von Hindenburg, who was elected president by a plebiscite, made use of his right and appointed Adolf Hitler chancellor, thus legalizing the rise of National Socialism. Anxious because of this experience, the authors of the present constitution decided that all future presidents be elected by the indirect method. On behalf of the German population of 80-million, the German president was elected by 1324 delegates on 23 May 1994. Half of them were Bundestag members, and the other half were delegates from the 16 regional parliaments and independent representatives from public and cultural life. Roman Herzog, the 60-year-old president of the Federal Constitutional Court, was elected by simple majority after a seven-hour voting procedure, since he failed to achieve the absolute majority in the first two election rounds. He obtained 696 votes, which was more than his rival Johannes Rau, who obtained 605 votes. It was necessary that he obtain at least eight votes more than 663 in order not to depend on the votes by rightist radical party members (Republican Party). The new German president won the election owing to the liberal party (FDP [Free Democratic Party]), which, as it was predicted, decided to support the Christian Democrat candidate in the third election round, thus confirming its decision to remain in the ruling coalition. The interview with the first president of the united Germany was held in Karlsruhe, two days before the election meeting [21 May 1994]. Roman Herzog was relaxed and said with self-irony that he would have to write a speech the following day just in case the worse thing happened -- if he was elected president. Taking "this worst possibility" as probable we asked Mr. Herzog the first question. [Trivic] How does a man who will replace the already legendary Richard von Weizsaecker feel? [Herzog] I have to tell you that it is exceptionally difficult to replace such a personality as Mr. Richard von Weizsaecker. It is hard to believe than anyone could be as successful as Mr. von Weizsaecker, let alone be better. For this reason, it is a big challenge, too. I cooperated with Mr. von Weizsaecker for a long time and I can say that there will be no significant differences between us, as far as both domestic and foreign affairs are concerned. There will be no change in this respect. The Term of Office of the "Republicanized Monarch" [Trivic] What will be the main tasks of the new president? [Herzog] He has to contribute to the new political constellation in Europe and in the world, which we have had for several years already. Germany, and not only Germany, but the whole of Europe has not yet processed the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw bloc. Until several years ago everybody thought in terms of two political blocs, in terms of a ping-pong play between these two blocs, these two hemispheres. Now, we must establish direct contacts with the newly established countries in Central and East Europe. This requires from us in Germany to develop a new foreign policy culture. The president will have to make a considerable contribution to these issues. One of the main functions of the president will be to make centrifugal forces, which traditionally belong to a pluralistic and democratic society, less powerful than centripetal. The Bundestag should remain the center of various social and political interests, but at the same time there must be organizations and institutions which will enable a minimum of unity. These institutions are the president of the republic and the Constitutional Court. The president has had more responsibility since Germany became united; he has had to influence the feeling of solidarity in western Germany because the eastern part of the country has to develop. The president must explain to the citizens in the western part that it was only historical circumstances which affected the development of the eastern part of Germany, for which reason they need help now. We should not treat them as a burden, which happens sometimes. [Trivic] The powers of the German president are not large. [Herzog] This is true. If we wanted to broaden them, the constitution should be changed. [Trivic] Do you think that the indirect election method is democratic enough? [Herzog] If you want a powerful presidential function, as is the case in the United States or in France, for example, the president should be elected according to the direct electoral method. If you, on the other hand, want a weak presidential function, as is the case in Germany, there is no reason why he should not be elected indirectly. The Italian or German president is something like a "republicanized monarch," with a limited term of office, of course. Adenauer's Children's Loyalty [Trivic] Some European countries are afraid of the new, united Germany. Are these fears irrational? [Herzog] Yes, this can be heard very often, but I have heard other things, too, such as expectations from East and Central Europe -- which are, admittedly, expressed with much caution -- that Germany should solve all their problems. There is a tendency in East European countries to become closer to Germany, even to the extent that they give the impression of an area of German hegemony. One of the German foreign policy tasks has been and will be to avoid such a development. It must be pointed out that Germany alone cannot finance the reconstruction of Central and East Europe, because it has its own eastern part. It is only natural that help must be offered to East Europe, but this must be done on the European level. England and France, West Europe in general, must create a bridge toward Central and East Europe in order to support economic reforms and growth. Germany must not express any hegemonistic tendencies toward this area; what is more, it must not allow such an impression to be created anywhere, because this would spoil the relations Germany has been creating in Europe for over 40 years. We must always remember that relations between Germany and France have been normal for only 40 years now, and that it is a real wonder of this century that the almost archetypal animosity between these two countries was overcome. This must not be put at stake. I believe in the future Germany integrated into Europe. If this has functioned for the past 40 years, why should it not function also in the future? [Trivic] There are people who claim, however, that Helmut Kohl is the last German chancellor of European orientation, that all of his followers will choose a strictly national platform. What do you think about this? [Herzog] I do not agree with such statements. Adenauer's children and grandchildren remained loyal to his political vision. I think that also his great-grandchildren will persevere on that road. Adenauer's ideas have to be repeated and proven again and again, though. [Trivic] Many people warn of an increasingly stronger neo-Nazi movement and rightist extremism. [Herzog] This requires a very careful analysis. Representatives of rightist extremism, predominantly Nazis of old attitudes, were excluded from the public political scene a long time ago. In the meantime new generations have appeared. After half a century the taboo against National Socialism and its stigmatization have weakened so that there are certain groups of young people with such ideas, who have now appeared on the political scene. They make public appearances and this creates the impression that they are very powerful. I think, however, that this is only the matter of an improved acoustics, if I may say so. I do not agree with the statement that this is a significant shift of political powers in Germany toward the political right. The problem lies in several "dreamers" who would like to return Germany to Bismarck's politics. As far as criminals and terrorists who kill people, burn houses, and attack asylum-seekers are concerned, we have to be merciless; all means allowed in a constitutional state must be applied. [Trivic] You once said that the opinion that all Germans are of the same blood is a historical error. How do you define the German nation? [Herzog] It is an old question how to define a nation. There is one nation in Europe which has had the fewest problems with this issue -- the French. They had first created their state so that their nation could develop within its borders. The German national consciousness was created as late as in early 19th century. A German state had not existed at that time. A nation is naturally defined by the element of a common language, but Switzerland is proof that this criterion does not have to be fulfilled. There are elements of common history and tradition, but Germany is proof that neither these elements have to be fulfilled. Beginning with the Reformation, the German population proved its nationality through mutual wars. A common origin as an element of the nation cannot be overvalued, either. If you look at the roots of all Germanic peoples, you will see that one third of them are "germanized" Celts, and that one fourth, and perhaps more, have Slavic roots. The feeling that you belong to one nation does not necessarily have something to do with the same origin and the same blood. I am really not fond of these criteria. It is neither true that all members of a nation must have the same mental characteristics. There is the prejudice in Germany, too, that all German people have to think and feel in the same way, which is absurd since they have never been equalized. Different geographic origins which enable different influences have, for example, determined that a German from the province of North Rhine-Westphalia is influenced by France, someone from Hamburg by Scandinavia and England, and a Bavarian by Italy, Austria, and the European East. This has caused many difficulties throughout history, but I see these differences as a big chance. The things which are now going on in Central and southeastern Europe, the discovery of major problems, such as "Who am I and where do I come from?" etc., and the fall into categories inappropriate to our time sound really threatening after having known the tradition of internationalism for several decades. It is difficult to speak about the notion of state sovereignty in a classical way in a modern, integrated, and interdependent world. That is why I think that it will take a long time to solve these problems. Living With a "Surplus of Sensitivity" [Trivic] Do you think that Germany, because of its neo-Nazi and extremist groups, makes a worse impression abroad than France, for example, although there are nationalist and extremist provocations there, too? [Herzog] This is understandable. The horror caused by the Nazi regime cannot be forgotten within one generation only. I have much understanding for the bad impression Germany makes abroad, but I think that these things will be sorted out, too. When there are provocations by rightist extremists in France, they are not connected to the Holocaust of 6 million Jews. We have to live with our past, although our children have no responsibility for it. I was 11 at the end of war. My children cannot be blamed for something which happened 50 years ago, but the German people have to learn how to live with this "surplus of sensitivity" toward them. This is perhaps good for our own "political hygiene." It can always be claimed that the Nazi catastrophe could have happened in some other country, too, but there is a significant difference -- this happened to us, and not to somebody else. [Trivic] How would you comment on the Balkan crisis and the role of Germany there? [Herzog] Unfortunately, I still cannot see a reasonable solution to the Balkan crisis. I think that a joint NATO and UN military intervention would only make things worse. I would not like to see German troops in the Balkans because of the negative historical mortgage we have in that area. As far as the position of Germany within NATO and its role in the Balkan crisis are concerned, this is a very contradictory issue. On the one hand, there is understanding for German restraint from participation in an intervention, but Germany is, on the other hand, reproached for not fulfilling its obligations like other NATO members must fulfill them. It is even reproached for enjoying certain privileges. I hope that a political solution will be found, although the fact that it has not been found yet casts a shadow on that hope.
