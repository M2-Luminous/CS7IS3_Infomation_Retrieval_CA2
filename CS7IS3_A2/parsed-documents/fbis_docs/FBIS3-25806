The methods of specific implementation and main points are as follows: --Establish an economic ring along the Chang Jiang which takes Pudong of Shanghai as the dragon head and covers eight areas and 28 large and medium-sized cities between Chongqing and the Chang Jiang Estuary. --Speed up the construction of infrastructure and key projects in the region, including over 100 backbone projects with an investment amount of over 200 billion yuan each, such as the Shanghai Jinshan 1-million-metric ton oil refinery project, the Pudong international airport, the Shanghai sedan project with an annual production capacity of 300,000 cars, the Shanghai acetic acid standard project, the second-phase Qinshan Power Plant project, the Panzhihua nonferrous metal project, the Beijing-Shanghai express railway project, the Hubei sedan project with an annual production capacity of 300,000 cars, and the Three Gorges project. --Quicken the pace of using foreign funds in areas along the Chang Jiang and diversify the fields in which foreign capital is used. Except for the pornography and gambling industries, which should be banned, and state-level telecommunications facilities, which are not open to the outside world, other fields may in principle utilize foreign capital, which is estimated at around $10 billion. --Open the domestic market to foreign businessmen. Use foreign capital according to international practice, i.e. the BOT [Board of Trade] method, with foreign businessmen being responsible for investment, construction, and operation for a period of 15 years and the Chinese side purchasing the products manufactured by foreign-invested enterprises. --Remove the "restricted areas." Given that state interests are not infringed upon, foreign businessmen should be allowed to invest in those trades they deem appropriate. It is disclosed that, to implement the plan, the state will, between now and the year 2000, build a number of key projects in areas along the Chang Jiang and the scope of investment is 1,000 billion yuan.
