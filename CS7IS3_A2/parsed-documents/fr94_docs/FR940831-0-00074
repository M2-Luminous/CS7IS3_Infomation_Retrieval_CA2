ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is amending its regulations on carriage of bulk hazardous materials. These amendments assign additional carriage requirements, a higher Pollution Category, or both to certain commodities already listed in the tables. These amendments are necessary to align the minimum requirements in the table with those approved by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) for inclusion in its Chemical Codes applicable to tankships. Additionally, the Coast Guard is making various revisions to correct past errors. EFFECTIVE DATES: September 30, 1994. ADDRESSES: Unless otherwise indicated, documents referenced in this preamble are available for inspection or copying at the office of the Executive Secretary, Marine Safety Council (G-LRA/3406), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW., room 3406, Washington, DC 20593-0001 between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Drafting Information The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Mr. Curtis G. Payne, Project Manager, and Ms. Helen G. Boutrous, Project Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel. Related Rulemakings On April 11, 1994, the Coast Guard published a final rule (FR) entitled Bulk Hazardous Materials in the Federal Register (59 FR 16999) updating its chemical tables to reflect the International Maritime Organization's (IMO's) final and provisional determinations, with the exception of ``upgrades'' to entries currently in the IMO Chemical Code. On October 17, 1991, the Coast Guard published a final rule entitled ``Benzene'' in the Federal Register (56 FR 52122) which became effective January 15, 1992. On December 13, 1991, the Coast Guard published a correction to that final rule entitled ``Benzene; Correction'' in the Federal Register (56 FR 65005) which became effective January 15, 1992. Elsewhere in this edition of the Federal Register , the Coast Guard is publishing a final rule concerning upgrades to the noxious liquid substances lists in 33 CFR 151.47 and 151.49 (CGD 94-901). Also in this edition of the Federal Register , a notice and request for comments (CGD 94-902) is published concerning cargo entries the Coast Guard has reason to believe are obsolete. Background and Purpose This rulemaking updates various Coast Guard hazardous materials tables in 46 CFR parts 30, 150, 151, and 153 to include ``upgrades'' to requirements authorized by Coast Guard regulations or international law. An ``upgrade'' means that a commodity is assigned additional carriage requirements, a higher Pollution Category (Pol. Cat.), or both. The upgrades assigned by this final rule were determined by the IMO for inclusion in the IMO Chemical Codes (``International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk'' (IBC Code), and ``Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk'' (BCH Code)). Adoption of these upgrades in the Coast Guard regulations is necessary to ensure consistency with international law. These upgrades were included, for informational purposes, in an appendix to the Bulk Hazardous Materials NPRM published on May 20, 1993 (58 FR 29937). At that time, the IMO had determined the upgrades, but were not scheduled to become effective until July 1, 1994. The upgrades, with brief explanations where helpful, are shown in a table in the Discussion of Amendments section below. The corrections and editorial revisions included in this rule are also discussed below. Discussion of Amendments (a) Benzene and benzene containing cargoes. Concurrent with the ``upgrade'' actions, the IMO has revised the gauging requirement for benzene and benzene containing cargoes to ``closed''. This revision has been based upon the known human health hazards posed by the chemical benzene. Today's rulemaking incorporates this revision in both the Coast Guard's tankship table of minimum requirements, table 1, part 153 as well as its tank barge table of minimum requirements, table 151.05, part 151. Compliance with the tankship requirements must be met as of the effective date of this rule, to coincide, as closely as possible, with the implementation of the amendment to the IMO Chemical Codes. However, compliance with the new tank barge requirements of this rule is not required until August 15, 1994. (b) Corrections to listed electrical hazard class and group. As indicated in the Table of Changes below, the currently listed electrical hazard class and group of various entries in table 151.05 of 46 CFR part 151 are corrected. The entries below were identified by the Cargo Classification Working Group of the Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee (CTAC) 151 Subcommittee as having erroneous electrical hazard class-group listed in the tank barge table. The revised electrical hazard class and group listings shown below have been verified using the National Fire Protection Association's NFPA 497M, ``Manual for Classification of Gases, Vapors and Dusts for Electrical Equipment in Hazardous (Classified) Locations,'' 1991, or the National Academy Press's NMAB 353-5, ``Classification of Gases, Liquids and Volatile Solids Relative to Explosion-Proof Electrical Equipment,'' 1982. These revisions merely correct errors contained in the informational electrical hazard class and group column in the table and represent no change in requirements for the industry. The electrical hazard class-group of the entries listed below from table 151.05, part 151 will be corrected as indicated: 1Cargo name 1Current 1New Acetone cyanohydrin i0NA i0I-D Adiponitrile i0NA i0I-D N-Aminoethyl piperazine i0I-D i0I-C Aniline i0NA i0I-D Dichloromethane i0NA i0I-D 2,2'-Dichloroethyl ether i0I-D i0I-C Ethanolamine i0NA i0I-D 2-Ethylhexyl acrylate i0NA i0I-D Ethylidene norbornene i0I-C i0NA Formaldehyde solution (37% to 50%) i0I-C i0I-B 2-Methyl-5-ethylpyridine i0NA i0I-D Methyl methacrylate i0NA i0I-D Phthalic anhydride (molten) i0NA i0I-D Phenol i0NA i0I-D 1,2,3-Trichloropropane i0NA i0I-D Toluene diisocyanate i0NA i0I-D Triethanolamine i0NA i0I-C Triethylenetetramine i0NA i0I-C Tetraethylenepent amine i0NA i0I-C This rulemaking also makes other non-substantive editorial changes and corrections, including a correction to an error contained in the final rule entitled ``Bulk Hazardous Materials'' published April 11, 1994, in the Federal Register . In revising the section heading to §153.560, the Coast Guard inadvertently revised the section number to incorrectly read as ``§ 153.60'' (59 FR 17028). This error is corrected in this final rule. The correct section number is 153.560. The Table of ``Upgrade'' Changes below lists all changes by the IMO, as ``upgrades'' to current entries in the IMO Chemical Codes and Coast Guard regulations with a brief explanation where helpful.

Accordingly, the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) to publish this rule without opportunity for comment. On May 24, 1993, in an appendix to the Bulk Hazardous Materials NPRM (58 FR 29937), the public was notified of the IMO revisions that are being adopted into Coast Guard regulations by this final rule. Future rulemaking The IMO reevaluated the Pol. Cat. and ship type of a number of entries based upon revised Hazard Profiles from the Working Group on the Evaluation of the Hazards of Harmful Substances Carried by Ships (EHS), EHS 28 meeting held in February 1993. This action resulted in several entries in the IMO's Chemical Codes having their Pol. Cat. or carriage requirements ``downgraded'' or ``upgraded''. All ``downgrades'' have been incorporated into Coast Guard regulations by the final rule, CGD 92-100 published April 11, 1994. The ``upgrades'' from the EHS 28 meeting will be incorporated into Coast Guard regulations by a future rulemaking. A new Table of ``Upgrades'', as are known at this time is set out in Appendix I to this rulemaking for the information of interested parties. Regulatory Assessment This rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this final rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures is unnecessary. This rulemaking is largely administrative in nature and updates the chemical tables by adding cargoes recently authorized by the Coast Guard or added to the IMO Chemical Codes and makes other non-substantive editorial changes and corrections. Some costs are associated with the changes instituted by the IMO. Many U.S. flagged tank ships covered by these regulations are already in compliance with these requirements which coincide with existing regulatory requirements. The Coast Guard has identified costs associated with the ``upgrade'' from open or restricted gauging to closed gauging. However, because of the marine vapor control systems regulations (final rule CGD 88-102, 55 FR 25396, June 21, 1990), the Coast Guard has reason to believe that most U.S. tank vessels, barge or ship certificated to carry any commodity affected by this rulemaking, will have or is having its gauging refitted to be in compliance with the vapor control regulations. A sampling of barge operators and tank ship operators supports this position. Because of the IMO requirements which ``upgrade'' ``motor fuel anti-knock compounds'' from the current ship type II to ship type I, there may be an economic impact on vessels certificated to carry this material. No U.S. flagged vessels are certificated to carry this material. World-wide there are six vessels certificated to carry this commodity, of which four are operated by a U.S. company, the remaining two are operated by an overseas company. All six vessels are certificated under foreign flags; four Liberian and two Norwegian. These ships currently may meet the requirements of ship type I vessels, in which case, there will be no economic impact. However, the Coast Guard has no information on these foreign flagged vessels to indicate whether the ships certificated to carry this material currently meet those requirements. Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), the Coast Guard must consider the economic impact on small entities of a rule for which a general notice of proposed rulemaking is required. ``Small entities'' may include (1) small businesses and not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields and (2) governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000. This rule does not require a general notice of proposed rulemaking and, therefore, is exempt from the requirements of the Act. Although this rule is exempt, the Coast Guard has reviewed it for potential impact on small entities. This final rule is largely administrative in nature. Some costs are associated with the IMO requirments implemented by this final rule. As discussed above, most U.S. flagships that are covered by this rulemaking are in compliance with this rule due to existing regulatory requirements. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This final rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this rulemaking in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. This rulemaking is largely administrative in nature and will merely update current chemical tables in Coast Guard regulations and will have no Federalism implications. However, the authority to implement the requirements of this rule has been committed to the Coast Guard by Federal statutes and the importance of uniform requirements in the carriage of bulk hazardous cargo aboard ships moving from port to port requires that the Coast Guard preempt conflicting State and local requirements in the same subject area. Environment The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this final rule and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this action is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. This rulemaking is an administrative update of current tables to add chemicals already approved under Coast Guard regulation or international law. Any impact on the environment will be positive because the carriage requirements established by the IMO could result in a reduction in maritime pollution from tankships.

Dated: August 18, 1994. J. F. McGowan, Acting Chief, Office of Marine Safety, Security and Environmental Protection. Appendix to this Final Rule Note: The following appendix will not appear in the Code of Federal Regulations. SUMMARY: The information contained in this appendix is for informational purposes only, and is intended to provide mariners with insight into revisions that may be adopted in future rulelmaking actions. It does not change existing regulations. The table below lists ``upgrades'' to current entries in the IMO Chemical Codes and Coast Guard tables and lists that, if adopted by the IMO as anticipated, would take effect sometime in mid-1997. This table was prepared from documents from the IMO Evaluation of Hazards Working Group (BCH), BCH 23 meeting (September 13-17, 1993). The IMO reevaluated the Pol. Cat. and ship type of a number of entries based upon decisions reached at the EHS 28 meeting held in February 1993. The decisions were based on the Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Pollution (GESAMP) Hazard Profiles from the Working Group on the Evaluation of the Hazards of Harmful Substances Carried by Ships (EHS). The reevaluations resulted in several ``downgrades'' and ``upgrades''. All ``downgrades'' established at that meeting have been incorporated into Coast Guard regulations by the final rule, CGD 92-100, published April 11, 1994. These new, and any other ``upgrades'' established in the future will be included in future Coast Guard rulemaking(s) to coincide with amendments to the IMO Chemical Codes. As stated above, at this time, the next set of amendments is scheduled for adoption in mid-1997. ``Upgrades'' to current entries in the various tables consist of increased carriage requirements or revised, higher Pol. Cat.'s. The Coast Guard does not consider a change in Pol. Cat. from a provisional category, designated by having square brackets ``[ ]'' around it, to a final Pol. Cat. as an ``upgrade'' or ``downgrade''. It is considered a final assignment and takes effect immediately upon IMO's removal of provisional status. All ``upgrades'' as are currently known are addressed in this appendix.

In its continued effort to maintain consistency between the requirements of the tank ship regulations (part 153) and the tankbarge (part 151) where applicable, the Coast Guard, in a future rulemaking, will be changing, modifying or adding carriage requirements as discussed in paragraphs (a) and (b) below. (a) In order to conform tank ship and tankbarge requirements, special requirement 151.50-5 - ``Cargoes having toxic properties'' will be added to the entries in table 151.01 of part 151 of the tankbarge regulations for the commodities listed below. This is in conformance with the current special requirement for these comodities found in tank ship regulations at § 153.525, ``Special requirements for unusually toxic cargoes''. Acetonitrile Acrylonitrile Ammonium hydroxide Butylamine Carbon tetrachloride Crotonaldehyde Chloroform Dichlorobenzene 1,1-Dichloropropane 1,2-Dichloropropane 1,3-Dichloropropane 1,3-Dichloropropene Diisobutylamine Diisopropylamine N,N-Dimethylacetamide Di-n-propylamine Ethylamine solution (72% or less) N-Ethylbutylamine 2-Methylpyridine 1,1,2-Trichloroethane 1,2,3-Trichloropropane Trichloroethylene Triethylamine These discrepancies between the special requirements in the tank ship table and the tankbarge table were identified by the Cargo Classification Working Group of the Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee (CTAC) Subcommittee on the Revision of Title 46 CFR part 151. These changes, to be included in a future rulemaking, would conform the requirements for unusually toxic cargoes in table 151.05 of part 151 with the requirements in table 1 of part 153 for the same material. (b) In addition, the entries in table 151.05, part 151 listed below were identified as having discrepancies between the requirements for venting, or gauging, or both, as indicated by an ``X'' in the chart below when compared to the tank ship requirements: ␣ 1Cargo name 1Tank Vent 1Tank Gauge Acetic acid i0X i0X Adiponitrile i0␣ i0X (iso-, n-) Butyl acrylate i0␣ i0X Butylamine (all isomers) i0␣ i0X Carbon disulfide i0␣ i0X Carbon tetrachloride i0␣ i0X Camphor oil i0X Chlorobenzene i0␣ i0X Chloroform i0X i0X Chlorosulfonic acid i0␣ i0X 2,4-D, dimethylamine salt solution i0X i0X 1,3-Dichloropropene i0␣ i0X Ethylidene norbornene i0␣ i0X Hydrochloric acid i0X i0X Isoprene i0␣ i0X Morpholine i0X i0X 2-Methylpyridine i0␣ i0X Oleum i0X i0X Propionic acid i0X i0X Propylene oxide i0X i0X Styrene i0X 1,2,3-Trichloropropane i0␣ i0X Vinylidene chloride i0X These discrepancies between the requirements in the tank ship table and the tankbarge table were identified by the Cargo Classification Working Group of the Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee (CTAC) Subcommittee on the Revision of Title 46 CFR Part 151. The tankbarge requirements for venting and gauging will be reviewed by the Coast Guard to insure that these requirements meet a minimum level of safety. The changes will be part of a future rulemaking to conform the requirements of the two tables. 2. Coal tar. The Coast Guard is considering whether to initiate a future rulemaking to remove the entry ``coal tar'' from table 30.25-1 and from the list of flammable and combustible bulk liquid cargoes in parts 30-40, and then adding it to table 151.05 of part 151. The addition of this entry to table 151.05 is consistent with the inclusion of other members of the coal tar ``family'' of commodities already in the table because of similar health safety hazards. This action would also make the tankbarge and tank ship tables consistent with respect to this family of commodities. The Coast Guard is coordinating this action with the American Coke and Coal Chemicals Institute's Task Force on Marine Shipping Regulations for Coal Tar Products under the guidance of the Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee (CTAC). The entry ``coal tar'', and its family members are currently included in table 1 of part 153, and no action affecting this table is planned. 3. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solutions. In a future rulemaking, the Coast Guard will revise the carriage requirements of the two hydrogen peroxide solution entries in table 1 of part 153, and add requirements to table 151.05 of part 151. The revision of the tank ship requirements in table 1 will correct omissions when these entries were first entered into the table. The addition of these entries to the tankbarge table will permit carriage of this material by barge. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;20717 Filed 8&hyph;30&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;14&hyph;F
