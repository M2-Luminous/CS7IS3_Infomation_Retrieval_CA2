On Friday he gave the following written interview to EL TIEMPO's political editor. [EL TIEMPO] During your absence, President Cesar Gaviria said that dark forces were trying to create friction between the two of you. Do you think such forces exist? [Samper] If the president says so, it must be so. The important thing is what he and I feel. I strongly support his actions concerning the government, the Constitutional Congress, drug traffic policy, and the internationalization of the economy. Along with the majority of the Colombian people, I believe President Gaviria's liberal government has been good for the nation and I support the renewal he has undertaken. Furthermore, the president knows when and on what occasions I have supported him at the times when he needed it. He also knows that I am not a person who keeps score on political debts. [EL TIEMPO] Some commentators say some ministers should be removed from the cabinet to emphasize your conceptual and political differences with the president. What do you think? [Samper] As I said before, I support President Gaviria's liberal government, so I find no reason to consider such a decision. Also, it is the president who decides about changing ministers. [EL TIEMPO] Do you think there are electioneering intentions in the book by Mauricio Vargas that portrays you as a weak person more concerned about political position than about ideas? [Samper] I will confess to you that I have not read the book by SEMANA's editor, though my friends agree that it is an anti-Samperist treatise. Nor do I know if there are political intentions behind it. If so, that would be the start of a new phase of politics in Colombia, a dirty war, which I am sure the Colombian people will categorically reject. The raw material for the political debate cannot continue to be inner-circle gossip, backbiting, and rumors. The people have the right to have the candidates talk to them about solving the problems of unemployment, corruption, or the lack of security; that is what we are really interested in. [EL TIEMPO] Do you feel your campaign is being well run? [Samper] Yes. It has gone well and the polls show that. I am concerned, though, about the changing course the campaign is taking. The Colombian people know my style of politics, based on ideas and proposals, like the ones I have been presenting during the past six months about issues like unemployment, agricultural recovery, or the fight against corruption. Now we are trivializing politics, reducing it to gossip, trivia, and the calumny of the passing moment. That is not good for anybody. Colombia should think big; that is what the Colombian people expect from those who aspire to lead the destinies of the nation. [EL TIEMPO] Do you think you have lost spontaneity because of your advisers' strategies? [Samper] If I have to lose spontaneity, I would rather lose my advisers. [EL TIEMPO] Have you perceived uneasiness among your supporters in Congress about the way the campaign is going? [Samper] I have not heard much about that; I will look into it more in the coming week. Although I know the people urging these changes are acting in good faith and constructively, I believe the campaign should be measured by its results. And the results show that when I first began my campaign in May, the polls put Dr. Pastrana 21 points ahead of me; now, six months later, our own polls and those of the president show that I am six points ahead of the candidate of the Pastranist sector of conservatism. That means we are up 27 points. How can people say the campaign is not working with results like that? I want to convince the leaders who are with me now so that, with their valuable assistance, we can appeal to other social sectors that have traditionally not taken part in elections. My campaign strategy has been to reach out to those sectors and open up new areas for dialogue in universities, unions, and associations. [EL TIEMPO] Now that the Conservative Party has endorsed Andres Pastrana, do you think he is a rival who will force you to go to a second round? [Samper] Some people in Colombia have an admirable capacity for being surprised by normal events. Who was not aware that the Conservative Convention of the Pastranist sector of conservatism would announce its support for Pastrana, as it did last week? What would really have been surprising and democratic is if the convention had chosen a popular vote process, as liberalism did, to select the conservative candidate in a transparent and participatory manner, or if at the convention organized by Dr. Pastrana, Dr. Alvaro Gomez Hurtado and other conservative candidates for the nomination had been present. Unfortunately, that did not happen. Anyway, I am sure of getting enthusiastic support from liberalism and other political groups after the party vote so I will win the first round by a KO [knockout]. [EL TIEMPO] What did you learn during the trip from which you have just returned? [Samper] We did not realize Colombia's importance internationally. We tend to concentrate on small details, so we lose sight of what Colombia represents, the way the international community sees us. While people outside look at Colombia through a telescope, we focus on things through a microscope. We need to change that. If Colombia wants to move forward, we have to think big. For example, President Salinas told me he is convinced that Colombia could play in the same arena as Mexico: in the Pacific Rim community, in the Group of Three, and through the latter it could join in NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement], a connection that would right away generate over 150,000 new jobs, as Minister [of Foreign Trade] Santos was told.
