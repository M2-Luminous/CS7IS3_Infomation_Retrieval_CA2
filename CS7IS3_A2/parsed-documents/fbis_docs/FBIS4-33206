Referring to the strike being staged by the Tierra del Fuego metalworkers, the CGT stated that it supports the workers' calls "for maintaining the source of jobs, and warned that any delay in adopting measures to protect the regional economies, create jobs, and strengthen national industry will result in further social conflicts that will become increasingly more difficult to solve." The CGT also called for "the immediate adoption of measures to ensure that all provincial and municipal workers receive their overdue salaries." The CGT believes that "the alarming unemployment level -- which has surpassed historical records -- lays bare the reality of an ever-increasing impoverishment of large sectors of Argentine society, which results in social marginalization problems, forces students to quit school, causes infant malnutrition, and so forth." The communique concluded by pointing out that "unemployment is caused by lack of incentives for production and the unfair competition faced by products manufactured in Argentina."
