The secretary general of the Arab Lawyers' Federation and chairman of the Coordination Committee of the Sudanese opposition's National Democratic Grouping [NDG] has stated that Sudanese opposition radio will begin transmission next week "from somewhere outside the Arab homeland." A statement issued by al-Mirghani's office yesterday, of which AL-HAYAH has received a copy, said that reports of a reconciliation dialogue between al-Bashir and al-Mirghani were "not true" and that "the DUP's principled position regarding the regime of the (National Islamic) Front has been the same since the first day legitimacy was violated, namely that there will be no negotiation and no reconciliation with the regime, a position the party's leader, officials, and masses still adhere to." [passage omitted] In Cairo, Abu-'Isa [secretary general of the Arab Lawyers' Federation] said at a news conference held at the headquarters of the Arab Lawyers' Federation and attended by Sudanese parties that the Sudanese opposition radio "will next week begin transmission of its programs beamed to the Sudanese people inside and outside Sudan to expose the practices of the ruling Sudanese regime and work for its downfall." He said that the transmission would be from a country which he declined to name, but he stressed that "it is not Egypt or any other Arab country." Abu-'Isa said that the NDG "is now the target of internal and external plots aimed at splitting its ranks." He reaffirmed the NDG's support for "the Sudanese opposition's unity and its common objective of bringing down the ruling regime, restoring democracy, and stopping the war in the south." Abu-'Isa denied issuing a statement criticizing the political parties which form the NDG and calling for its replacement with a progressive rally. He reaffirmed interest in the continuation of the NDG and in working through it. [passage omitted]
