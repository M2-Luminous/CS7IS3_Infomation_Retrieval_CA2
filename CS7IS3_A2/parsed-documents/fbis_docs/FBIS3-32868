This means that our country will support the UN position whether it is decided they will use planes to defend the Bosnian areas under attack or conduct military operations against the attackers. The Argentine Foreign Ministry reported that Emilio Cardenas, Argentine ambassador to the United Nations, said so to UN Secretary General Butrus-Butrus Ghali during a long meeting they held on 8 February. Following clear instructions given by Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella, who is visiting three Caribbean countries, Cardenas told Butrus-Butrus Ghali that President Menem's administration will support the UN decision on air operations. It has not been reported, however, whether Argentina merely supports the operations or also will participate in them. Deputy Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella explained to LA NACION in New York: "It must be made very clear that Argentina does not approve measures of force; all it did was offer full support to whatever the secretary general may decide." Cardenas told Butrus-Butrus Ghali that Argentina strongly rejects attacks against Sarajevo's civilians. He insisted on "the need to consider the possibility of using security troops" from the United Nations who currently are controlling the region and include Argentine units.
