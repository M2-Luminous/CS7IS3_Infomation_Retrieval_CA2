Competitive Area 2. Alaska-Specific Social and Economic Development Strategies (SEDS) Projects A. Purpose and Availability of Funds The purpose of this competitive area is to announce the anticipated availability of fiscal year 1995 funds for Alaska Native social and economic development projects. Approximately $1.5 million of financial assistance is anticipated to be available under this competitive area for Alaska Native governance, social and economic development projects. ANA plans to award approximately 15&hyph;18 grants under this competitive area. For individual village projects, the funding level for a budget period of 12 months will be up to $100,000; for regional nonprofit and village consortia, the funding level for a budget period of 12 months will be up to $150,000, commensurate with approved multi-village objectives. B. Background Based on the three ANA goals described in Part I, ANA implemented a special Alaska social and economic development initiative in fiscal year 1984. This special effort was designed to provide financial assistance at the village level or for village-specific projects aimed at improving a village's governance capabilities and for social and economic development. This competitive area continues to implement this special initiative. ANA believes both the nonprofit and for-profit corporations in Alaska can play an important supportive role in assisting individual villages to develop and implement their own locally determined strategies which capitalize on opportunities afforded to Alaska Natives under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), Public Law 92&hyph;203. The Administration for Native Americans does not fund objectives or activities for the core administration of an organization. However, ANA will consider funding core administrative capacity building projects at the village government level if the village does not have governing systems in place. C. Proposed Projects To Be Funded Examples of the types of projects that ANA may fund include, but are not limited to, projects that will: Governance •Initiate demonstration programs at the regional level to allow Native people to become involved in developing strategies to maintain and develop their economic subsistence base; •Assist villages in developing land use capabilities and skills in the areas of land and natural resource management and protection, resource assessment and conducting environmental impact studies; •Assist village consortia in the development of tribal constitutions, ordinances, codes and tribal court systems; •Develop agreements between the State and villages that transfer programs jurisdictions, and/or control to Native entities; •Strengthen village government control of land management, including land protection, through coordination of land use planning with village corporations and cities, if appropriate; •Assist in status clarification activities; •Initiate village level mergers between village councils, village corporations and others to coordinate programs and services which safeguard the health, well being and culture of a community and its people;
