Xu Weikai, the member of the Guangdong People's Congress responsible for handling the motions, spoke highly of the motion. The illegitimate use of military license plates is a problem of major concern for interior inhabitants. It shows that the people at home share the views with those outside the border. The motion stated that, not long ago, Hong Kong newspapers reported an incident which took place in Shenzhen: When a military vehicle collided with a truck from Hong Kong, the driver of the military vehicle beat the driver from Hong Kong instead of giving an apology. Reportedly, the vehicle did not belong to the police, and it was only a company vehicle which used a military license plate to do businesses. The incident created an adverse influence in Hong Kong. The motion continued: It is said that, besides provincial and city leaders, the department- and bureau-level cadres also put military or police license plates on their cars. In order to make more money, some Army and police units openly sell license plates or lease military vehicles to businessmen. Such moves will affect relations between the people and the Army and police and will hinder the establishment of a modern urban management system, which will further deteriorate the already crowded traffic and damage the prestige of the Army and police. The motion urged provincial-level leading cadres not related to the Army or police to take the military license plates off their cars. It also advised the provincial people's congress to submit a report to the Central Military Commission, Armed Police Headquarters, and Public Security Bureau calling for a halt to the practice of selling or contracting military license plates, which harms the reputation of the state, Army, and police.
