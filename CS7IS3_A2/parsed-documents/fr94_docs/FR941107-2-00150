FR941107-2-00150 FR941107-2-00086 In its approval order, the Commission asked the BSE to study the effectiveness of its MOC order procedures. Specifically, the Commission requested the following information: (1) For all pilot stocks, the size of the MOC order imbalance on the BSE at 3:40 p.m. and at 4:00 p.m.; (2) for all pilot stocks, the price and time of the last regular-way trade on the BSE and the closing price; and (3) for each pilot stock with a MOC order imbalance of 50,000 shares or more at 3:40 p.m., an appropriate measure of volatility at the close on the BSE. On October 5, 1994, the Exchange submitted to the Commission its first monitoring report on its MOC order pilot program. The Commission finds that, although this monitoring report provides certain useful information concerning the operation of the pilot program, the BSE must provide further data before the Commission can fairly and comprehensively evaluate the BSE's use of its auxiliary closing procedures. To allow such additional information to be gathered and reviewed, without compromising the benefits that market participants might receive, the Commission finds that it is reasonable to extend the pilot program until October 31, 1995. In this regard, the Commission continues to believe that the pilot procedures should allow the BSE to obtain an accurate view of the buying and selling interest in MOC orders at expiration and, if there is a substantial imbalance on one side of the market, to provide the investing public with timely and reliable notice thereof. The BSE pilot program establishes a simultaneous 3:40 p.m. deadline for the entry of expiration-related MOC orders and for the cancellation or reduction of any MOC order. Substantial MOC order imbalances in the pilot stocks are required to be disseminated promptly thereafter. 12 Based on the Exchange's monitoring report, the pilot procedures, specifically the requirement that MOC orders included in imbalances be irrevocable and the restrictions on further MOC order entry, appear to have operated effectively on all expiration days covered by the report. Accordingly, the Commission is satisfied that any BSE imbalance publications should reflect actual investor interest. 12 The BSE has indicated that it would disseminate imbalances to its floor, its member firms and the investing public in a manner which is substantially similar to that utilized by the NYSE. Telephone conversation between Karen A. Aluise, Assistant Vice President, BSE, and Beth Stekler, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, on February 10, 1994. In addition, although the BSE's monitoring report does not reveal any unusual market conditions, the Commission continues to believe that, in the event of such conditions, the BSE should have sufficient time to attract contra-side interest to help alleviate imbalances created by the unwinding of index derivative related positions. As noted above, the pilot procedures require both the early submission of expiration-related MOC orders and, for the pilot stocks, prompt dissemination of substantial MOC order imbalances. While the Commission recognizes that 3:40 p.m. is relatively near the close, the Commission believes that deadline strikes a reasonable balance between the need to provide the investing public with timely and reliable notice of expiration-related order flow and the need to avoid unduly infringing upon legitimate trading strategies. The Commission is approving the proposed rule change on a pilot basis until October 31, 1995. As long as some index derivative products continue to expire based on the closing stock prices on expiration days, the Commission agrees with those self-regulatory organizations that argue that such procedures are necessary to provide a mechanism to handle the potentially large stock imbalances engendered by the unwinding of index derivative related positions. During this pilot program, the Commission expects the BSE to monitor the effectiveness of its MOC order procedures. The Commission therefore requests that the BSE submit a report to the Commission, by August 31, 1995, describing its experience with the pilot program. At a minimum, this report should contain, for each Expiration Friday and Quarterly Index Expiration Day, the following data: (1) for each pilot stock that had a MOC order imbalance on the BSE, the size of that imbalance at 3:40 p.m. and at 4:00 p.m.; (2) for each pilot stock listed in (1) above, the consolidated closing price and the number of shares of MOC orders printed on the BSE; and (3) for each pilot stock that had a MOC order imbalance of 50,000 shares or more at 3:40 p.m., an appropriate measure of volatility at the close for the BSE (for example, the change in price of the closing transaction, measured as a percentage, from the last trade and/or the change in the specialist's position) and a description of how the pilot procedures influenced market conditions. Any request to modify this pilot program, to extend its effectiveness or to seek permanent approval of the pilot procedures also should be submitted to the Commission, by August 31, 1995, as a proposed rule change pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act. The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of the notice of filing thereof. This will permit the pilot program to continue without interruption. In addition, the procedures the Exchange proposes to continue using are identical to the procedures that were published in the Federal Register for the full comment period and were approved by the Commission. 13 13 No comments were received in connection with the proposed rule change which initiated the BSE's MOC order pilot program. See BSE Pilot Approval Order, supra, note 6. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act 14 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;94&hyph;13) is hereby approved on a pilot basis until October 31, 1995. 14 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 15 15 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1991). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
