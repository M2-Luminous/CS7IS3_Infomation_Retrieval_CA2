Volodin; place and date not given: "The Crimean Party of Interethnic Trust Finds Supporters Not Only in the Crimea" -- first two paragraphs are O. Volodin commentary] [Text] Recently, the Political Council of the Crimean Party of Interethnic Trust [KPMD] came forward with an initiative that deserves our attention and support. The essence of this initiative is that the activities of the political parties and movements in the Crimea and outside of it should be coordinated on the principles of interethnic and civil accord. Permanent meetings of these parties and movements in their joint headquarters in the Crimea could become one of the mechanisms for the implementation of this idea. We queried KPMD Chairman Boris Sergeevich Balayan on their initiative. [Volodin] Boris Sergeevich, what specific parties and public movements would you like to invite to participate in the Crimean "roundtable"? [Balayan] Like-minded people, those political parties that do not simply speak about the principles of interethnic and civil accord and about peace but consequently look for opportunities to implement such noble principles. We negotiate, for example, with the party of "Russian Unity and Accord," headed by Sergey Shakhray, and with the popular political association in Ukraine headed by Vladimir Grinev and Leonid Kuchma. Besides, there are parties that advocate our principles in other parts of the Black Sea region, and in the states which are motherlands for many of Crimeans of various nationalities. These are Armenia, Greece, Bulgaria, Germany, and many other countries. [Volodin] The CSCE deals with the issues of keeping peace in the European home, there are many organizations which deal with the economy, science, and culture of many countries. How can you justify the creation of one more center in the Crimea? [Balayan] Our idea was not born in an empty place. The Crimea can claim the establishment of such a center on its geographical location, and historical traditions; we proceed from the task of turning our peninsula into a connecting link between the neighboring states, the region of peace and accord. Independent experts and scientists -- who are not usually engaged in political competition -- could draft scientific recommendations, a sort of code of rules on how to pursue a civilized policy for statesmen and political leaders at the meetings of parties of various ethnic membership. Of course, joint consultations of political scientists from Russia, Ukraine, Transcaucasia, and other states of the Black Sea region could help analyze the developments and foresee the future. In other words, we could prevent many negative conflicts so that we do not act "in a hurry," as it has been common for us until now. Finally, the setting up of such a permanent international body in the Crimea would objectively widen our economic, cultural, and social relations with a wide range of states as an answer to common interests. [Volodin] Do you believe in the success of your idea? [Balayan] Not only because we should believe in the eternal good. Our proposals have already met with the understanding of like-minded people from the interethnic parties outside the Crimea. I hope that the new Crimean president will pay attention to our proposal.
