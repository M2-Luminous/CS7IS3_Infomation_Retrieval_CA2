The PvdA [Labor Party] program would lead to the most even distribution of purchasing power. This was revealed by the Central Planning Office's (CPB) figures published this morning with regard to the electoral programs of CDA, PvdA, VVD, D66 [Democrats 66] and GroenLinks [Green Left]. All electoral programs focus on employment. Cuts in public spending must yield the necessary funds to reduce labor taxes and fees. CDA's cuts during the next cabinet period will be highest, i.e., 18.4 billion guilders. The other parties will save 17.6 (VVD), 12.6 (D66), 8.8 (PvdA) and 8.4 (Green Left) billion guilders. These cuts, announced by the parties in their electoral programs, come on top of the 5 billion guilders announced by the Lubbers/Kok cabinet in its "Million Note 1994." The decrease of taxes and fees decided by the cabinet last Friday [18 February], does not take account of this deficit in the budget. The CDA, VVD and D66 would have found it wiser if the cabinet had first covered this deficit, before reducing payments. "It is a shame that a cabinet which is leaving the setbacks for the next team, is already handing out bonuses which remain to be seen," VVD leader Bolkestein says. "One should not open the sunshade before one knows that the sun is actually shining, otherwise one might end up in the dark," Representative G. Tepstra, financial spokesman for the CDA party, says. The cabinet wants to reduce payments permanently in 1994 and 1995 by 5 billion guilders. In an interview with our newspaper, CPB Manager G. Zalm states: "It seems to me that these reductions are excessive, especially if they are not compensated fo by adjustments. There is the chance that the next cabinet will have to scrape together the cuts required to finance decreased income." In the PvdA program, the purchasing power of minimum wage-earners and people with an average income (40,000 guilders) decreases by 0.25 percent a year. The purchasing power of those earning twice the average income, decreases by 1 percent. The differences are a little more outspoken in the CDA, VVD and D66 programs. The purchasing power of the minimum wage-earners increases by 0.5 percent in Green Left's program, while payments by people earning average and twice-the-average income increase heavily. The CDA freezes all social allowances. The VVD also freezes allowances, except Old Age Pensions (AOW). D66 reduces indexation by more than half, but permits reduction of the gap between those on pension and people under 65 receiving an allowance. The PvdA wants to apply the indexation of allowances to the evolution of wages up to two-thirds during the next cabinet period. Yesterday, PvdA Party Leader Kok said that there is a "real possibility" that allowances would partly follow wages from 1995 onwards. Freezing the allowances has a "demoralizing effect. This is already true for a period of one year, let alone if you freeze it for four years," Kok stated on AVRO radio. D66 Reducing Deficit to 2.5 Percent D66's electoral program leads to the lowest financing deficit, i.e., 2.5 percent of the GNP in 1998 (the present deficit is 3.7 percent). The VVD arrives at a slightly higher figure, while the other parties arrive at a financing deficit of 3 percent. This is why VVD and D66 have less leeway in easing payments, which in turn has an unfavorable effect on growth, employment, and purchasing power over a four-year period. The overall tax burden (sum of taxes and social fee) reaches 42.0 percent in 1998; the VVD arrives at a slightly higher figure. D66 and PvdA reach a tax burden of 43.3 and 43.7 percent respectively. Green Left reaches an overall tax burden of 45.5 percent, due to the implementation of the energy tax. It is the first time that Green Left had its electoral program audited. The small Christian parties did not have their programs audited, although "quality support" was given. In VVD's program, new jobs are the result of a system change. The VVD introduces a minisystem for new cases, for whom the allowance amounts to 60 percent of the minimum wage. "Both in 1998 and in 2002, the VVD is the job champion, although few jobs are created in the public sector," CPB Deputy Manager Van den Berg explains. It is remarkable that in Green Left's program, employment decreases in the market sector, while the number of jobs increases in the public sector.
