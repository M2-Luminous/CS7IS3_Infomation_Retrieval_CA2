This morning the delegation from the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] held a meeting with the mediators. We do not yet know the reasons and the results of this meeting, because of the press censorship imposed by Malian-born Alioune Blondin Beye, UN special representative in Angola, at the beginning of the peace talks last December. All the same, it is known that the parties are discussing the formation of the new national police, national reconciliation, the future UN role in Angola, the release of prisoners, the sharing of power, and the second round of presidential elections. The talks will continue tomorrow.
