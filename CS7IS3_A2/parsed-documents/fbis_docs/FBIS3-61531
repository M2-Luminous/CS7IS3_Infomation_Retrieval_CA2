To this end, the dynamics of the specific glial proteins and antibodies to them in the blood of patients after neurosurgery are studied. To this end, 23 patients divided into two groups--14 with a verified brain tumor (principal group) and 9 in the control group--aged 35 to 45 are examined. The anesthetic procedure and research methodology are outlined. Brain _a_[.sub]1[/]- and _a_[.sub]2[/]-globulines, _a_[.sub]2[/]-glycoproteid, gliofibrillary antigen, and antibodies to them were examined; the number of neurospecific proteins and autoantibodies to them were determined by immunoferent methods and recorded by a multispectral Titerteck Multiskan spectrophotometer (by Flow, U.K.). Statistical data are processed using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney nonparametric criteria. The neurospecific protein concentration in the blood of the principal and control groups against the background of anaesthesia and during the postoperative period is summarized. A high neurospecific protein level is measured in the blood of most of the principal group patients during the preoperative period; it is speculated that the antiendematic drugs used before the surgery facilitated an increase in the hematoencephalic barrier permeability. Similar results were obtained in the control group. The conclusion is drawn that anaesthesia is the leading factor affecting an increase in the hematoencephalic barrier permeability to neurospecific proteins in the bloodbrain direction whereby the neurospecific protein dynamics make it possible to speculate that the glial protein synthesis is enhanced under the effect of anaesthesia. It cannot be ruled out that a massive neurospecific protein influx into biological fluids against the backdrop of dehydrating therapy, alcohol intake, neurolepsy, and traumatic brain injury generate the protective response preventing the autoimmune brain impairment.
