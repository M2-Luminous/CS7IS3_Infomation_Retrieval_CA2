Csaba Belenessy reports: [Belenessy] On the occasion of his 15 April visit to Budapest, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel confirmed that Germany considered it very important for Hungary to become a member of the European Union [EU] and NATO as soon as possible, said Geza Jeszenszky. He added, however, that because of Russian concerns, his German counterpart was more cautious in the matter of accession to NATO. In the view of the Hungarian foreign minister, these concerns are unfounded because NATO is of a defensive nature; it is not directed against anyone. What is more, if it expands to more remote eastern areas, the borders of freedom and well-being in Europe will extend further, and this could have a very beneficial effect on Russia's security and economic revival. In his address Geza Jeszenszky paid particular attention to the Balkan crisis. He said that Hungary could be proud of the fact that, among the Yugoslav successor states, it has very good relations with Slovenia and the friendly Hungarian-Croatian relationship, which has its roots in the historical past, has been restored. He stressed that Hungarian foreign policy had not taken hostile steps against Serbia; on the contrary, it had chosen the best possible path. This is recognized by Belgrade too, since January; as a result, the hatchet has been buried. [passage omitted] One of the basic conditions of a just resolution of the Yugoslav crisis, Geza Jeszenszky emphasized, is that Croatian Baranja [under Serb control] should be freed from the rule of foreign armed men who settled there and that those who had been driven away should be able to return there. Referring to this, Geza Jeszenszky mentioned not only the Croatians and the Hungarians, but also those Serbs who, before the war, had constituted 23 percent of the population.
