FR940111-2-00089 FR940111-2-00057 [Release No. 34&hyph;33425; File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;93&hyph;58] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. Relating to the Maintenance by Members of Certain Written Policies and Procedures Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on December 20, 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the CBOE. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The CBOE proposes to amend Rule 4.18 to provide that a member who is a lessor of a membership and who performs no other function in respect of the membership is not subject to the requirements of Rule 4.18 concerning the establishment, maintenance, and enforcement of written policies and procedures respecting misuse of non-public information. The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE, and at the Commission. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the CBOE included statements concerning the purpose of the basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The CBOE has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change The purpose of the proposal is to amend Rule 4.18 to provide that a member who is a lessor of a membership and who performs no other function in respect of the membership is not subject to the requirements of Rule 4.18 concerning the establishment, maintenance, and enforcement of written policies and procedures respecting misuse of non-public information. In its current form, Rule 4.18 requires all members to maintain and enforce written policies and procedures concerning non-public information. Lessor members who have no other activities, however, do not conduct any securities business in respect of their membership, and, according to the Exchange, are not required to register as broker-dealers under section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under these circumstances, the Exchange believes there is no reason to subject these members to the written policy and procedure requirements of Rule 4.18, which by their terms are meaningful only to an ongoing securities business. Accordingly, Rule 4.18 is proposed to be amended to clarify that members who perform no function in respect of their membership except as lessors do not have to establish, maintain or enforce written policies and procedures precluding misuse of non-public information. The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of section 6(b)(5) of the Act in particular in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and to protect the public interest by eliminating unnecessary costs and burdens without impairing CBOE's capacity to meet the requirements of the Act. (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose a burden on competition. (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to that which the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission will: (A) By order approve such proposed rule change, or (B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the CBOE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;93&hyph;58 and should be submitted by February 1, 1994. For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 1 1 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
