At the meeting, the principle of doing unified planning with due consideration for all concerned and ensuring major areas was reaffirmed and concrete arrangements were made for grain allocations and transfers between provinces in the first quarter of the year. According to the plan worked out at the meeting, in current grain allocations and transfers, it is necessary to implement the principle of making unified planning with due consideration for all concerned and ensuring major areas. The major areas to which grain will be transferred include eight provinces which are short of grain and three municipalities. The provinces are Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Hainan, Zhejiang, and the eastern part of Sichuan, and the municipalities are Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. When making arrangements for the grain transfer, priority will be given to special grain reserves, grain for market regulation, and grain for the fulfillment of trade contracts. It has been learned that for January this year, various provinces have worked out special transportation plans, adding 140 special trains for this purpose. This has added burdens to communications and transportation. The departments concerned are now discussing the issue with the railroad department to solve this problem. It is expected that in January, a plan to transport some 700,000 metric tons of grain will be fulfilled, including those which have already been transported, which will be 100,000 metric tons more than the original plan. In February and March, it is planned that a total of 4.1 million metric tons of grain will be transported.
