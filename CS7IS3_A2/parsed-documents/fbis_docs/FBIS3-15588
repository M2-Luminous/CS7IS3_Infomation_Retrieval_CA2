Indeed, it showed that the government does not have an integrated economic policy. And it cannot have. It is impossible to find anything like the present situation either around the world or in Russian history. The reserves have been exhausted, and the only way out is to maneuver between inflation economic collapse. No miracle-working prescriptions for salvation exist. This, in fact, can be considered the chief topic of V. Chernomyrdin's speech. So it only remains to surmise how skillfully the government will succeed in executing this maneuver. Meanwhile it seems that the political consequences of what happened in the Kremlin 4 March lend themselves to a more exact prognosis. Given the president's overall strategic supremacy, the monolithic union which the president and the premier displayed at the session and the clear demarcation of responsibilities between them -- B. Yeltsin assumes full control of the military-political bloc, leaving economic problems to Chernomyrdin -- give grounds for concluding that the executive in Russia is probably as strong and united as it has ever been since the end of 1991. This circumstance gives Russia the opportunity to enter a period of internal political stability, albeit a temporary one. It seems obvious that, despite its many shortcomings, the new Russian Constitution today plays a positive role as the main stabilizing factor. The predominance of the president's constitutional rights enables him, having a loyal government, to neutralize the danger stemming from the opposition concentrated in the lower chamber of parliament. This is also convincingly proved by the story of the development of the mini-crisis connected with the Duma's political amnesty decision. By letting the Lefortovo prisoners go free, the Duma has essentially let off the opposition's steam. No more effective results have been achieved. In the situation which has taken shape since then none of the Duma factions is interested in finding itself in the role of being a source of destabilization. None of the parties which have entered the Duma and thereby gotten an image of respectability will wish to part with it, since the interests of each of them are linked with the future presidential election. This is why, among themselves, the Duma communists are stigmatizing V. Anpilov for his statements about returning soon to vigorous political activity. This is why A. Rutskoy and R. Khasbulatov have been forced to publish statements of political passivity. In turn it has to be considered no coincidence that the president's team on 4 March took a demonstrative step away from the democrats toward the "legal Marxists." Following the amnesty decision a period of struggle against the president ended for the Duma and a stage of heavy lawmaking work began. Because the improvement of the state structure must not be tackled without parliament, and for the president this is one of the most important tasks today. At the same time the new Constitution, having strengthened the president's power and promoted stabilization, has also fully laid bare the importance under present conditions of the problem of the head of state's health. It is not difficult to trace in the examples of last July's internal political mini-crisis and the recent February one the fact that the president has only to fall ill for the situation in the country instantly to exacerbate. On the other hand, as soon as the president returns to active work, it at once calms down. The political results of the government's enlarged session enable us to assume that Russia can reckon on a quiet life, at least for the next few months. It is even possible that the traditional spring offensive by the opposition's extremist wing will not affect this process. But a subsequent exacerbation of the situation seems highly likely. The problem of growing unemployment has all the potential to become the chief destabilizing factor. It will primarily depend on the prime minister how successful he is in neutralizing this danger by implementing those ideas in his speech which deal with the organization of public works and with other measures that can curb the social explosion. But subsequently, as the presidential election approaches, the spiral of political confrontation will inevitably grow, and it is perfectly possible that approximately six months before the voting the Duma will pass a vote of no confidence in the government in order to neutralize the prime minister politically.
