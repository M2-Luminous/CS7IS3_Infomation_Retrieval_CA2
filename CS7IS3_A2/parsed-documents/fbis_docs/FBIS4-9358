Gal; place and date not given: "A Small Mammal Among Dinosaurs"] [Text] Before voting for a party, some 250,000-300,000 people in Hungary are first curious to know what party did what for environmental protection. The achievement of the Hungarian Green Party [MZP] is perhaps the biggest surprise of the election campaign so far: They succeeded in presenting a national list after gathering the nomination slips. The stormy phase in the history of the MZP began in the spring of 1993 when many people left the party. The views of the party's current leaders -- like the view on the so-called neo-Zionism -- have been repeatedly labeled as fascist. The national list of the 700-member MZP is led by Zoltan Medveczki. We interviewed the 31-year-old forest ranger and party chairman. [Gal] Many people find your success surprising.... [Medveczki] This is not a success for us; this is below our expectations. [Gal] What did you expect? [Medveczki] We thought that the elections would enable us to finally prove that green politics is neither rightist nor leftist. [Gal] Why? Where do you stand? [Medveczki] In front. We could be called small mammals among the huge socialist and democratic dinosaurs. [Gal] Your achievement is nevertheless surprising, all the more so because, as far as we know, you looked for candidates through advertisements. [Medveczki] This is a professional way of selecting candidates. Nixon also answered a newspaper advertisement, and later he became President. [Gal] All over the world, the green parties regard environmental protection as a major goal. What would you do for this? [Medveczki] The MZP is also engaged in politics for the benefit of environmental protection, human protection, and health protection. Environmental protection should be treated as a symptom, and not as a cause. This means that we Hungarians should also use green technologies instead of the obsolete technologies. Most cars in Brazil are running with alcohol made from sugar cane. Sugar beet could be grown along the highways in Hungary, and then the cars would also be running with alcohol here. And we would only laugh at the Arabs if they increased the oil prices in the meantime. [Gal] If I understand it correctly, surplus sugar cane is used for fuel production in Brazil. In Hungary, however, all that produce that would give way to the planting of "fuel sugar beet" would be missing. Am I mistaken? [Medveczki] Nothing would be missing. We are growing wheat in vain along the highways. In addition, this way, we also eat the lead together with the bread, and then we are surprised to learn that Hungary has the biggest number of cancer cases. [Gal] You often declared that you support the construction of the power station at Nagymaros. You must be quite alone with this opinion. [Medveczki] We start from the premise that a lot of money has been invested in the construction of the dam. We are also aware of the advantages of such a dam. [Gal] But there is no water in the Danube. [Medveczki] This is precisely the point! The Danube is carrying less and less water and, therefore, dams are essential. Such dams should be constructed in as many places as possible, because these dams modify the unfavorable climatic effects and increase the level of ground water. Besides, the secretary of the MZP was the first person who refused to listen to anyone here and went to Slovakia to get information there. [Gal] We quote from your party's leaflets: "Hungarians should eat Hungarian fruit, including apples from Szabolcs, peaches from Kecskemet, watermelons from Csany." They should? [Medveczki] The consumption of national plants is the basis of our national independence. It is a proved fact that everyone should eat the products of the ecosystem in which he lives, because he can only digest this type of food. [Gal] Another slogan: "Among the political organizations in Hungary, it is only the Green Party that is deliberately fighting against the following monstrosities: prostitution, homosexuality, an immoral way of life.... microwave ovens, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and McDonald's." How does a political party fight against prostitution, homosexuality, and an immoral way of life? [Medveczki] We would inform the people that there would be no need for prostitution with an adequate sexual culture. Prostitution and homosexuality are the hotbed of AIDS. However, these monstrosities are constantly advertised in Hungary. No children will be born from a relationship between two homosexuals, and we would not like to see the Hungarian nation disappear from the Carpathian Basin. [Gal] I think this violates human rights and also the Constitution of the Hungarian Republic. [Medveczki] If the homosexuals start thinking, they will realize that we are also fighting for them by strengthening the role of the family with our positive advertisements. We Green men like women, and the Green women like men. [Gal] The MZP also set up a police group and a defense commando unit. What for? [Medveczki] We will defend not only others, but also ourselves against those who attack us. [Gal] A commando unit attacks, it does not defend. [Medveczki] The condition of acceptance in this unit is a basic knowledge of aikido. This combat sport uses the attack energy for defense. If you want to hit me, I will not kick your head off, I will only defend myself. Besides, this commando unit has various tasks. We will have to face tremendous catastrophes in the near future, and this might urge people to blow up the nuclear power stations. The life defense commando unit would find these people and neutralize them. [Gal] You also declared war on the so-called neo-Zionism. What is that? [Medveczki] More correctly, it is pseudo-Zionism. We would like the Arab-Israeli conflict to end. Both Jews and Arabs should be informed that they are not the ones who confront each other in this conflict; those who are inciting this war are the ones that confront each other. [Gal] People find several similarities between the symbol of the MZP and the Nazi symbol. [Medveczki] I would suggest those who judge our party on the basis of such outside appearances to try to use this on the United States or the FTC [a Budapest soccer club], because these two organizations also have the same eagle in their symbol. It is strange that the orange used by the Federation of Young Democrats in their advertisements does not bother anyone, although the orange is a non-Hungarian fruit.
