The letter reads: I am shocked by the news of the horrific massacre of Palestinians in Hebron. The seriousness of the incident is aggravated by the fact that it took place during the holy month of Ramadan, in God's shrine, during the holy act of morning prayer. The latest crime in Hebron, like the recent massacre at the market in Sarajevo, is the kind of crime that leaves one speechless. We consider the innocent victims at the mosque in Hebron to be our own. We pray God to bestow everlasting blessings upon the dead and give patience to their families, the letter says.
