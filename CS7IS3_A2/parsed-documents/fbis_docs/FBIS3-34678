FBIS3-34678 "drnes030_k_94011" FBIS-NES-94-030 Document Type:Daily Report 14 Feb 1994 IRAQ Daily Assesses Clinton Position on Arabs, Bosnia JN1202122694 Baghdad INA in Arabic 1030 GMT 12 Feb 94 JN1202122694 Baghdad INA Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Text] Baghdad, 12 Feb (INA)--The newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH has said that U.S. President Clinton's positions toward the Arabs since the bombardment of Baghdad have been part of a scheme designed to pulverize the Arab nation and eliminate Islam. In its editorial today, the paper criticizes the state of collapse and retreat that has characterized Clinton since he assumed power in the United States. Facing a host of ethical and financial scandals, which the U.S. media has drowned him in, Clinton has kneeled down until his forehead has begun to touch the ground in order to appease the media and secure their silence over his scandals, the paper said. AL-JUMHURIYAH added: Last week, Clinton chose to lie to the Congress regarding Iraq. This week, he chose Libya with the aim of inflaming the Congress against the Arabs and Muslims. It is known that Clinton has asked the Congress to impose more sanctions on Libya on the pretext that it threatens U.S. national security. This is the same formula Clinton used last week claiming that Iraq is trying to rebuild its nuclear weapons. AL-JUMHURIYAH recalls the U.S. President's comment on Sarajevo's heinous massacre. He said the United States cannot unilaterally intervene to end the massacres there. The paper vehemently assailed the arrogant U.S. position on what the Bosnian Muslims are facing, noting that Clinton is not ashamed of admitting that the indifference toward what is taking place in Bosnia-Herzegovina emanates from the fact that the it is not a country that produces oil or strategic items. AL-JUMHURIYAH regrets the fact that human rights issues, from the viewpoint of the world's superpower, are based on the principle of sheer material interests. This demonstrates their new approach toward implementing a criminal Malthusian policy based on the mass annihilation of humans. The paper asserted that these proposals by the White House administration reveal the criminal nature of the U.S. strategy. This strategy is based on noninterference in world events depending on two points: First, whether there is a threat to U.S. national security; second, whether there are funds and military capability outside the United States; in other words, others' resources are used to achieve U.S. objectives. The paper urges the one billion Muslims, including the 200 million Arabs, to adopt a militant position in order to prevent the crimes of the new Malthusianism and stop the isolation of Arab and Muslim countries.
