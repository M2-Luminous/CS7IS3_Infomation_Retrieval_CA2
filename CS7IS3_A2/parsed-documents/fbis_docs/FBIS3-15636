The situation in the republic continues to deteriorate and has approached a state of crisis. The growth of crime, which is threatening the formation and development of our young republic, is particularly disturbing. The negative impact of the shadow economy is increasing, discipline and order are declining, organized crime is growing everywhere, and firearms are being used for criminal purposes increasingly often. An emergency situation, which demands the adoption of radical measures, has taken shape in Crimea. All this is keeping the republic on edge, evoking people's alarm and disquiet, creating an atmosphere of unmanageability, and engendering irresponsibility and an impermissibly airy, nihilistic attitude toward the laws and state discipline. Questions of ensuring elementary order based on conscious discipline are taking precedence today in order that everyone might have confidence in the present and the future, that there might be sufficiency, and that people might cease to fear for themselves and their nearest and dearest. Everyone who performs his duty conscientiously should be sure that he is under the protection of the law and the president. Today I appeal to you, my electorate. Your assistance in desisting from ill-considered political steps and unreasoned actions, which could destabilize the situation even more. Your assistance in helping the law enforcement authorities and in creating volunteer formations to safeguard public order and put a stop to law-breaking, primarily at the place of residence and employment. The current dangerous crime situation cannot be altered without there having been a fundamental change in the attitude of the outfits of enterprises, the population of cites, settlements, and villages, and of the entire community toward this matter, which is of vital importance to all. A system of measures of moral and material encouragement of the community for participation in law enforcement activity and the utmost assistance to it on the part of the law enforcement authorities, enterprises, and organizations is being created to this end. It is essential that all citizens with unregistered weapons immediately turn them in to the internal affairs authorities and that, if necessary, a decision be made on the question of whether to register them or not. Measures in accordance with the Criminal Code of Ukraine will be applied in respect to persons who possess weapons illegally and who continue to store them. I appeal to the law enforcement authorities, primarily militia officers, who are at the forward edge of the fight against crime. The majority of you are conscientiously performing your professional duty to the people, worthily mounting guard of the interests of the state, and protecting the citizens' rights and liberties. At the same time, the activity of many internal affairs authorities does not correspond to the demands made of it. The struggle against embezzlement, profiteering, hooliganism, and the increased manifestations of organized crime is failing to produce the due results. Hundreds of criminals, among whom there are many who have committed serious crimes, remain at liberty, which is a stern reproach to the professional honor of the militia officers. Unfortunately, complacency and an uncritical attitude toward the results of their activity are being displayed by some of them, and rudeness, indifference, and extortion are being tolerated. We need to emphatically rid ourselves of such officers and to preserve the purity of the militia ranks. While displaying attention to and concern for law-abiding citizens, militia officers must be implacable toward transgressors. Their actions in respect to law-breakers must be precise, competent, and legitimate. Let the criminals know that their every unlawful action will be emphatically cut short and that, should they resist, authorized weapons, the right to use which has been broadened for militia officers as of late, will be used against them. The president and government of Crimea will, in turn, do everything necessary to provide the city and district internal affairs authorities as quickly as possible with motor transport and other facilities necessary in the work of crime prevention and detection. I appeal to the employees of the news media and the corps of journalists that they develop the all-around and truthful coverage of problems of the fight against crime, actively uncover the causes of negative manifestations, and contribute to the molding in the public of a respect for the law, the enhanced authority of the employees of the militia, the court, the public procurator's office, and other law enforcement authorities, and propagandize the positive experience of the public formations in the prevention of law- breaking. The government and law enforcement authorities of Crimea and the population of the republic have sufficient forces for cutting short by decisive and firm actions the orgy of crime and ensuring legality and firm law and order. Yuriy Meshkov, president of the Republic of Crimea No. 76, 2 March 1994, Simferopol.
