"Russia does not and will not bear the responsibility for Stalin's regime. Neither shall we engage in redrawing the borders or even discuss this problem," he said. The results of the Assembly confirmed that the earlier expressed fears that the normalization and development of Russia's relations with the three Baltic states might not suit certain political forces in those countries, he continued. Individual Baltic politicians are looking for new pretexts for substantiating their anti-Russian policies, instead of giving a historical assessment to the dramatic historical events, said Karasin.
