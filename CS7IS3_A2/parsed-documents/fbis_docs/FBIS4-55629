The positive response to the bond issue would seem to bear out last week's announcement by an ever-confident Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus that the Czech economy is on a steady course to post-transformation stability. International credit rating institutions have been singing the same tune for over a year now. Standard and Poor's assessment for the second half of 1993 put the Czech Republic on the same level as Turkey and Israel, a full three points above European Union member Greece. Last year, Moody's awarded the Czech Republic a higher credit rating than any other post-communist state. And now the results of a poll last week of the 100 foremost international banks published by the American finance magazine INTERNATIONAL INVESTOR placed the Czech Republic 40th out of 100 states on the world scale of credit stability. Hungary, which, until the split of Czechoslovakia, ranked at the head of the post-communist countries, wound up in the 43rd position in the magazine's tables. Slovakia came in 59th place. But while the numbers are revealing, they don't quite tell all, according to some observers. "There's no real value in comparing Eastern European countries' credit ratings," said Richard Kriz of the Delegation of German Business in Prague. "It's more a matter of an overall regional growth." Most Czech financiers were guardedly optimistic about the results of the international poll and of the ratings garnered by another magazine, EUROMONEY. The publication also placed the Czech Republic in 40th place out of 100, this time relating to investment risk. Martin Svehla of the Czech National Bank (CNB) cited macroeconomic influences as the main reason for the credit boom. Specifically, he mentioned a low but stable exchange rate supporting exports, the low rate of inflation and the bottoming-out of performance decline. All have made the Czech Republic a honey pot for international investors, as have low production costs and a skilled work force, he said. Josef Dufil, Client Service Department manager at Czechinvest, said the main areas of foreign investment are at present car parts manufacturing, light industry, electrotechnology and, in particular, mechanical tool production. In that field, foreign participation jumped from 4 percent in 1992 to 10 percent last year. "These areas all take precedence over consumer goods production at present," said Dufil. The glowing results and even rosier forecasts do not mean that all will be easy sailing in the future, warned the CNB's Svehla. "I think the hardest times may still be ahead of us," he said. This pessimistic view reflects the fact that the Czech Republic is in many ways more liberal than the Western European economic models it aspires to emulate. As Klaus continues to boast about the country's macroeconomic performance, public attention is turning to non-economic matters, such as the environment and the standard of living. "Mr. Klaus says we must earn environmental improvements," said Dufil. "This will be very expensive, and with elections approaching there will be increasing pressure on the government to do more about it." Svehla agreed that the environment will prove a costly thorn in the government's side, especially when other key economic factors must inevitably change in the future. "Exchange rates and costs cannot remain as low as they are indefinitely, especially as the active role of government is being reduced through privatization," he said. The reduction of the government role in industry will take longer than the mere completion of the second wave of privatization that commenced two weeks ago. "That is only part of it," said Svehla. "Once legally privatized, it still takes time for large structures to restructure themselves and become truly private enterprises. I hope we are powerful enough to cope in the future."
