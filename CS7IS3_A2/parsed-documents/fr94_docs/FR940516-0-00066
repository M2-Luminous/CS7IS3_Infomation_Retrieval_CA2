FR940516-0-00066 FR940516-0-00016 DEPARTMENT OF STATE 22 CFR Part 22 [Public Notice 2006] Schedule of Fees for Consular Services, Department of State and Foreign Service of the United States AGENCY: Bureau of Consular Affairs, Department of State. ACTION: Interim rule. SUMMARY: This interim rule amends ยง22.1 of title 22, Code of Federal Regulations by creating a surcharge for the processing of machine readable visas (MRV's). That surcharge, pursuant to OMB Circular No. A&hyph;25, is set at a cost-recovery based level of $20,00 per visa application. DATES: Effective Date: The effective date for the new fee is May 16, 1994. Date for submission of comments: June 15, 1994. ADDRESSES: Interested persons are invited to submit comments in duplicate to the Office of the Executive Director, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Department of State, Washington, DC 20520&hyph;4818. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Holcombe Thomas, Office of the Executive Director, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Department of State, Washington, DC 20520&hyph;4818, (202) 647&hyph;1148. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION Background Public Law 103&hyph;236, enacted April 30, 1994, authorizes the Secretary of State to collect a surcharge for the processing of machine readable visa (MRV) applications, and to retain the resulting revenues, up to a ceiling of $107.5 million for fiscal years 1994 and 1995. This authority has been delegated to the Under Secretary for Management. It supplements and in part overrides section 281 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) which generally provides for nonimmigrant visa fees to be set on the basis of reciprocity. The Secretary of State has also been authorized under E.O. 10718 of June 27, 1957, to exercise the President's authority under 22 U.S.C. 4219 to prescribe rates of fees to be charged for official services performed by the Department of State. Under this authority, the Department has determined a number of fees for consular services performed overseas, as well as in the United States, within the guidelines set by OMB Circular No. A&hyph;25. The policy set out in Circular A&hyph;25 states that services which directly benefit individuals, organizations, or groups should be paid for by the users rather than the taxpayers. Services performed for the primary benefit of the general public or the U.S. Government are to be supported by tax revenues. The principles of Circular A&hyph;25 have guided various fee studies conducted by the Department. As a result, although the authority to charge for processing a machine readable visa is new, the Department has for a number of years had on hand Circular A&hyph;25-based cost estimates for visa processing. In the Department's latest consular fee study, issued in January 1991, the cost of processing a nonimmigrant visa was determined to be $18.47. Equipment used to process machine readable nonimmigrant visas (MRV's) is considerably more expensive than the equipment used to issue the outdated stamped visas which the MRV is replacing. Given these additional equipment costs and the costs of collecting the fee, the new fee has been set at a cost-recovery level of $20.00 per visa application. This fee may in fact be below cost, but the Department believes that it is an approximate level at which to set the charge initially, given the base estimate of $18.47 and the need for a fee that can be collected with minimal transaction costs. A $20.00 fee is a whole dollar amount. Moreover, in discussing the new fee with members of Congress, $20.00 was discussed in light of the 1991 cost study as the initial amount at which the new fee would be set. The implementation of this rule as an interim rule, with provision for post-promulgation comments, is based upon the ``good cause'' exception found at 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) and 553(d)(3). The authorization for the collection of a processing fee for machine readable nonimmigrant visas and machine readable combination border crossing card mandated by Public Law 103&hyph;236 took effect on April 30, 1994. This rule must take effect upon publication to ensure that the Department maximizes surcharge revenue for the balance of fiscal year 1994. The Department will be relying on such revenues to fund accelerated installation of improved visa processing and issuing technology at consular posts. The installation of such technology has become a high priority for the United States in light of the World Trade Center bombing and increasing concerns about visa fraud and alien terrorist activity in the United States. This rule is not considered to be a major rule for purposes of E.O. 12291 nor is it expected to have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. In addition, this rule does not impose information collection requirements under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. This rule has been reviewed as required by E.O. 12778 and certified to be in compliance therewith. This rule is exempt from review under E.O. 12866, but has been reviewed internally by the Department to ensure consistency with the objectives thereof.
