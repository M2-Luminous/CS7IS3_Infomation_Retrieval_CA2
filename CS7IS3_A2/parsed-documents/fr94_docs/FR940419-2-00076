FR940419-2-00076 FR940419-2-00038 [Docket No. 94M&hyph;0067] MBf USA, Inc.; Premarket Approval of AWARE Test System AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing its approval of the application by MBf USA, Inc., Boca Raton, FL, for premarket approval, under section 515 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), of the AWARE Test System. The Clinical Chemistry and Toxicology Devices Panel recommendation of approval, with conditions, was made at a November 4, 1991, panel meeting. Approval was originally sought for over-the-counter (OTC) use by the applicant. However, FDA has decided that this panel meeting did not consider various issues, and so the panel will resume deliberating OTC use at a second meeting. As a result of the need for a second panel meeting, the applicant revised the indications for use to reflect a more limited use. After reviewing the recommendation of the Clinical Chemistry and Toxicology Devices Panel, FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) notified the applicant, by letter of January 18, 1994, of the approval of the application. DATES: Petitions for administrative review by May 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written requests for copies of the summary of safety and effectiveness data and petitions for administrative review to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857.

Aziz, Center for Devices and Radiological Health (HFZ&hyph;440), Food and Drug Administration, 1390 Piccard Dr., Rockville, MD 20850, 301&hyph;594&hyph;1243. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On December 13, 1990, American Drug Screens, Inc., Oklahoma City, OK 73108, submitted to CDRH an application for premarket approval of the AWARE Test System.

On November 4, 1991, the Clinical Chemistry and Toxicology Devices Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee, an FDA advisory committee, reviewed and recommended approval, with conditions, of the application. On January 18, 1994, CDRH approved the application by a letter to the applicant from the Acting Director of the Office of Device Evaluation, CDRH.
