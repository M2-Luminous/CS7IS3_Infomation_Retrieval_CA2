Despite the possibility that the government may dissolve Parliament or reshuffle the coalition if it fails to win a compromise over constitutional changes, many analysts are confident the growth rate for the entire year will stay above 8 percent. If the government motion for constitutional changes is defeated today and Parliament is dissolved, the shock to the economy would only last one to two months, according to Olan Chaiprawat, president of Siam Commercial Bank. Still, the growth rate for all of 1994 would remain above 8 percent. He said the political crisis would not lead to a "dead end" for Thailand's economy which he predicted would post a growth rate of 8.1 percent even with a House dissolution. "There is nothing to worry about in the short run. The world economy is recovering. There is nothing to worry about at all, even if Parliament is dissolved," he said optimistically in an interview with The Nation. He emphasized yesterday that a change in the government was a normal process in a democracy. The stock market reacted cautiously yesterday to the uncertain political outlook with a moderate 1.4 percent drop, by 19.35 points to 1,359.53. Olan said the government should decide how to best improve the situation. "I believe that if the government announces a House dissolution tonight (last night), the stock index will rise tomorrow (this morning) since investors prefer a more stabilized situation," he said. Worawi Wangli, president of Nakhonthon Bank, said the situation is not as bad as during the May 1992 bloodshed. He said the Thai Bankers Association would not become involved in the political crisis. "This is the task of politicians," he said. An analyst at Thai Investment & Securities Co said if the government is defeated today, the stock market support line would be 1,332 points, and if the situation worsened, the index could plunge to 1,284 points. "If the House is dissolved or the Cabinet is reshuffled, the resistance line may be between 1,372-1,392 points," the analyst predicted. She added that any impact on the economy would be shortlived but she did not expect an important impact on the stock market as at most, only some political figures would be changed, and that would not dramatically affect economic structures. Somchai Phakaphasawiwat, adviser to the House's economic subcommittee, said some infrastructure projects could be further delayed if there is a political change and that could affect the overall economy. However, economic growth will remain healthy as the budgets for the fiscal year would be spent as usual. "The stock market may benefit from the change as foreign and local investors see a clearer political situation. Volatility may occur, but only for a short time," said Somchai.
