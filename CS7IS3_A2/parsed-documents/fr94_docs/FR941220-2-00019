FR941220-2-00019 FR941220-2-00012 [Docket No. CP95&hyph;118&hyph;000] East Tennessee Natural Gas Company; Notice of Application December 14, 1994. Take notice that on December 12, 1994, East Tennessee Natural Gas Company (East Tennessee), P.O. Box 2511, Houston, Texas 77252, filed in Docket No. CP95&hyph;118&hyph;000 an application pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act for a certificate of public convenience and necessity permitting it to construct and operate certain pipeline loop and compression facilities to ensure continued transportation service to its shippers, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. East Tennessee proposes to construct and operate 2.14 miles of 12-inch pipeline loop and 3.02 miles of pipeline loop, both in Washington County, Virginia as well as uprate three existing turbines at its Compressor Station No. 3110, in Morgan County, Tennessee to Solar Saturn Model T&hyph;1300's, each with an I.S.O. rating of 1360 horsepower, resulting in an increase of 960 horsepower. East Tennessee estimates a construction cost of $4,264,978, which would be financed initially with funds on hand, funds generated internally, borrowing under revolving credit agreements or short-term financing and which would be rolled into permanent financing. East Tennessee states that its current total firm contractual commitment is approximately 476,507 dt equivalent of natural gas per day. It is indicated that since 1988 East Tennessee's system has been designed to meet this obligation in part by receiving approximately 5,000 dt equivalent of natural gas per day from Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia Gas) and delivering it to Roanoke Gas Company (Roanoke) via an interconnect between Roanoke and Columbia Gas. It is stated that in 1988 East Tennessee and Roanoke entered into an operating agreement specifically providing that approximately 5,000 dt equivalent of natural gas per day of Roanoke's total transportation quantity of 9,789 dt equivalent of natural gas per day could be delivered to Roanoke at the Columbia Gas interconnect. It is stated that this arrangement enabled East Tennessee to reduce the volumes that it was required to transport on its system to Roanoke and thus make those volumes available for East Tennessee's other customers. East Tennessee states that the operating agreement has expired by its own terms and that Roanoke has advised that it was not interested in extending the agreement. It is indicated that, as a result of terminated agreement, East Tennessee now proposes to construct and operate the above-described facilities. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before January 4, 1995, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that a grant of the certificate is required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for East Tennessee to appear or be represented at the hearing. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
