"I do not have a thought at all of (Diet) dissolution or of resignation of the cabinet en masse," Hosokawa said at a news conference after a visit to Ise Shrine, an annual ritual for an incumbent premier. Speculation has arisen that Hosokawa may dissolve the Diet or resign with other cabinet members if the political reform package fails to pass the House of Councillors during the session. Hosokawa has staked his political future on getting the political reform package into law, at first by the end of last year, and now by the end of the session which has been extended by 45 days. The four government-proposed bills, which passed the lower house on November 18, are now pending in the upper house. The prime minister also told reporters that he is willing to have further negotiations about the bills with Yohei Kono, president of the major opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), if they will bear fruit, he said. Hosokawa met Kono before the package passed the lower house, seeking concessions about the package, but they failed to reach an agreement. Hosokawa also said the government will not give up the plan to complete the construction of a dam on the Nagara River in spite of objections from environmentalists. He said he hopes the dam will be completed during the next fiscal year beginning in April. He said the nearly-completed dam will be built "cautiously," based on the outcome of a new environmental assessment promised in December by Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi. The dam project had caused an international uproar when an appeal made by Japanese environmentalists demanding a halt drew attention from foreign ecology groups. Hosokawa said an advisory panel will be set up to discuss the overhauling of the nation's defense program, adopted in 1976. Based on its advice, the government will decide on measures by the summer, before the ministries submit their preliminary requests for fiscal 1995 budget draft. The measures to be taken will affect the budget, he said. Defense Agency officials have envisioned a smaller Ground Self-Defense Force with enhanced mobility and information gathering capabilities in line with the post-Cold War situation. Hosokawa said the government will submit a product liability bill to the next ordinary session of the Diet beginning January 31. He also pledged efforts for the early enactment of a Public Information Act.
