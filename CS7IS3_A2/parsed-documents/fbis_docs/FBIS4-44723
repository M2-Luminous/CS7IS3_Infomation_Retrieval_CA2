The secondary lead refining plant at Muldenhuetten in Saxony will be modernized at an investment expense of DM30 million. The project is being presented by the company Recycling und Umwelttechnik GmbH [Recycling and Environmental Technology] at the TERRATEC in Leipzig. It is contributing to the continuation of a positive trend: lead release into the environment has been reduced by 80 percent since 1985 in Germany. Muldenhuetten, which was first mentioned in 1395, has a tradition in this area. Silver production was followed there by the production of lead, zinc, arsenical compounds and sulfuric acids. The company was adapted through technological improvements and new buildings to a capacity of 70,000 tons of secondary lead annually during the GDR era. A record chimney 200 m high became the new, widely visible trademark of Muldenhuetten. However, its environmental friendliness was limited to distributing the high sulfur dioxide emissions--they arose among other things through the thermal decomposition of the lead paste--widely over the surrounding countryside. In addition, the lead recycling process was very energy-intensive and yielded all kinds of waste: plastic components from the used batteries could not be reprocessed. After reunification Muldenhuetten was threatened with closure. "It could only be averted by a solid solution from the private sector," Behrendt sums up. The Muldenhuetten business group was detached from the former GDR collective combine Saxonia AG. In 1992 the Muldenhuetten Recycling und Umwelttechnik GmbH was created as a subsidiary of the Rheinische Zinkgesellschaft [Rhine Zinc Company] of Duisburg. The group in the Erz Mountains also came in contact with an experienced sister company on the Rhine, the BSB Recycling GmbH in Braubach with a related kind of production: accumulator recycling. It is true that they used a process which was categorized by the U.S. EPA as "BAT": best available technology. This engineering process which had proved itself in the Braubach model plant is now the center of the refitting in Freiberg. The used batteries were completely disassembled using the principle of updraft sorting--a prerequisite for the recovery of all valuable components. These are the major steps in the process: first worn-out starter batteries--in acid-proof containers--are brought to the factory in an environmentally safe manner and stored in a protected place. The next step is mechanical disassembly and separation into electrodes, lead oxide-lead sulfate mixture, polypropylene, ebonite, PVC and used acid. The desulfurization of the sulfate-containing portion of the paste with alkalis produces desulfurized paste and sodium sulfate solution. Then the charge mixtures are combined and smelted in short drum furnaces with high-efficiency filters for waste gas cleansing. The raw lead is refined and alloyed and cast into marketable form. The new technology brings along with it many pluses for the environment. For example, the guidelines of the TA for air on the limits for toxic emissions are exceeded, in the case of dust and lead sometimes by up to 75 percent. Production becomes almost free of waste. The desulfurized lead paste is melted down and cast along with the grid metal; most of it is put back into battery production. Polypropylene, from which the battery cases are made, can be recovered with a purity of 99.5 percent. In the form of compounds, which correspond to new materials in quality, they go out to plastics processors and are reused, for example, in building groups of the automobile industry. Used sulfuric acid is completely recovered and can also be used again. The sodium sulfate which arises during paste desulfurization is raw material for the cellulose, glass and detergent industries. "Our sodium sulfate will have detergent quality," Behrendt promises. All that is left of the accumulators in the end is ebonite and PVC--about seven percent of the total weight; an efficient solution to reintroduce them into the economic cycle still needs to be developed. The air is becoming cleaner in the Mulden valley and its surroundings: the sulfur dioxide emissions have been reduced to less than 10 percent compared to the earlier process. But the Freiberg group is not satisfied with the traditional Braubach technology. They want to be the leaders in Europe in recycling. "We are using the opportunity to incorporate the newest technological details," technical head Behrendt explains. This includes improved short drum furnaces as well as slit screens with finer mesh in the sorting phase; the milling stage for polypropylenes is completely omitted. In Muldenhuetten refitting is in full swing at the moment while production continues. By mid-year the simultaneous game will have to come to an end. Refitting for the engineering technology process requires the cessation of the old production. But then the number of employes will also have to be reduced, from the current 200 to 150 when modernization has been completed. For the two old, environmentally harmful blast-furnaces in the refinery which still remain will be shut down. The Freiberg people still have one worry: their West German parent company, the Rheinische Zinkgesellschaft is a subsidiary of the Frankfurter Metallgesellschaft [Frankfurt Metal Society] AG. The giant company is on the verge of bankruptcy because of mismanagement. A banking consortium staved off the worst at the beginning of the year--for Muldenhuetten too, it is to be hoped. "The situation scarcely affected us here," says managing director Dr. Hans-Joachim Kessler with relief. And he adds, as a kind of option on the future: "We will not be a burden to the Metallgesellschaft." 9337
