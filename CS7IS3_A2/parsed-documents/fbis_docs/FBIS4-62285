The Russian president will have, together with his partners, to advocate the shutting down of the Chernobyl AES [nuclear electric power station]: Yeltsin's influence on Ukraine, it is said, will be crucial.... He will then be required to provide guarantees that Russian AESes where high-power pressure-tube reactors are in use will also be gradually withdrawn from operation. If Yeltsin does not agree, the Western countries "will deny aid." A similar ulltimatum has already been received by Ukraine: Economic aid to Kiev now depends directly on the shutdown of the Chernobyl AES reactors. The "softening-up fire" prior to the decisive attack on the nuclear power industry of Ukraine and Russia was carried out at the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] session of experts held in Vienna. It is common knowledge that a commission set up by this international organization analyzed the condition of the Chernobyl AES. And although commission members were unable to prepare their findings prior to the Vienna conference and did not present their conclusions, the IAEA's decision was conclusive: It is essential to close down the reactors at Chernobyl and shut down the station, because it is "too old." The IAEA and other international organizations will help run other Ukrainian AESes only if Chernobyl is shut down. The IAEA is making precisely those recommendations in the runup to the G-7 meeting in Naples. The IAEA leadership is in a hurry: Only a little time remains before July, so they have decided not to wait for the special commission's findings. The Ukrainian delegation has naturally disagreed with the IAEA. Western countries promised assistance, particularly as regards modernizing the power units at Chernobyl, a long time ago, but not a single dollar has been forthcoming. And to dismiss the AES at Chernobyl as "old reactors" is, to put it mildly, unjust. For the last two years the AESes of Russia and Ukraine have operated more stably and reliably than those in America, France, Sweden, and Germany. It is those countries which are the leaders in terms of the number of times safety systems have been activated. And the term "old" can only make specialists smile. More than 150 nuclear power units, of which around 50 are in the United States, are far "older" than the high-power pressure-tube reactors. Consequently, when they were designed and built, the safety requirements were quite different: Not a single one of those units meets requirements. What, then, has produced the attack on the former USSR's nuclear power industry? The point is that in market relations economics and politics are closely allied. Russia, for example, has quit the arms markets. And now the United States sells weapons in countries which previously looked to us. Uranium is next in line. Here competition is very tough, because selling uranium is a profitable business: It is small wonder that our country has always been subject to restrictions. The shutting down of reactors will enable Western and U.S. firms to penetrate not just East Europe but Ukraine and Russia too. Again, we are talking about billions of dollars. Unfortunately, we ourselves are aiding and abetting our Western competitors. Russia's nuclear power stations receive scant finance. Loans to carry out maintenance and modernization are lacking and wages are constantly paid late. Where else could you find a country where the staff of nuclear power stations such as the Kursk AES have received no wages for six months and have declared a hunger strike in protest? Highly skilled specialists in any other country are not just well paid but are the state's pride and joy.... Perhaps we should accept the "ultimatum" of the world's leading countries and close down the AESes? But we must realize that we would then turn from being an exporter to an importer of energy. And no one will supply us with energy for free. So are we going to live by candlelight?
