By their oppressive blockade, the United States and Britain cannot harm the Iraqi people more than they did through their unethical and inhuman practices, criminal aggression, and destruction of Iraq's economic, industrial, and health infrastructure. Moreover, the Iraqi people possess and will continue to possess an exceptional ability to hold firm, endure, and fight. This is because any comparison between losing their identity and freedom on the one hand, and holding on to patience and defiance to achieve the objectives for which they have offered great sacrifices on the other, will make them choose endless defiance and patience. Actually, what hurts and pains the Iraqi citizens are the practices of some of their fellow citizens and the painful internal blockade that they have been imposing. Driven by greed and a tendency to exploit others, these people have lost all principles and morals. This blockade is being exercised by people who once were penniless and are now rich, who once were hungry and now are overfed. These people will not be pardoned by their fellow citizens. He who creates his wealth and luxury from illegal money and at the expense of others' hunger and need will not enjoy his life, for it is wrong to believe that sources of wealth are inexhaustible and that one can do without others. Certain people's practices against their fellow citizens have been exposed and their justifications found unacceptable. They are like spiders extending their webs to trap the citizens. Deep in their souls, which are dominated by greed and parasitism, there exists the same criminal instinct of the spider, which kills its own offspring. Certain greengrocers and grocers have turned the highway pavement around Baghdad into a black market to avoid the prices fixed by the government. They have emptied the Baghdad markets of everything. Tomatoes, potatoes, beans, everything is piled up on the highway pavement. They are not piled up by peasants or owners of nearby farms, as some may think. Rather, they are carried from markets and groceries to occupy the highway pavement, where tomatoes are sold at 35 dinars instead of 20 dinare per kilo, potatoes sold at 75 dinars instead of 30, and peas at 15 dianrs instead of 10. The quantities of beans that appeared recently left cold storage plants only after their prices were raised. The price of anything with a fixed price has been deliberately raised. The price has also been raised for any material that citizens tend to buy as a substitute for the expensive meat. Had the potatoes stored in in cold storage plants been released, they would have met citizens needs for at least three months, and would have brought their prices even lower than the fixed price. Committees, which would be called "emergency committees," should be set up and given extensive authorities to impose tough punitive measures against violators. Such committees would not only monitor markets or greengroceries, but also cold storage plants. Weekly inventories of the contents of such plants should be carried out. No materials needed by the market should be allowed to be hoarded there. Such committees should also be given the authority to take to account any peasants who, upon the instructions of greengrocers, delay the collection of their crops to raise their prices. Another type of committees should be set up to monitor the domestic commodities poured into the market. There should be a balance between the cost of each commodity and the price at which it is sold. This is because if it is left up the managements of factories to specify the prices, and in view of the continued, unjustified price hikes, the citizen will be only the victim. Setting up "emergency committees" relying on citizens' consciences and cooperation will have a great effect in deterring the hoarders of basic supplies and vegetables.
