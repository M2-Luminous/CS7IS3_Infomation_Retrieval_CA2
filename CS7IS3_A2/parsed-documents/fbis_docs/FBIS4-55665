The UN secretary general recently reiterated that statement, thus contributing -- along with many others who hold that view -- to cementing the stupid but utterly lethal thesis: that the war in the former central Yugoslav republic was preordained owing to the republic's multiethnic and multicultural situation. That it is, therefore, an internal war, and that no one stoked up the fire under the "Bosnian pot," and that nobody can do anything apart from containing the tragedy within its "natural and ethnic borders." First of all, that "revelation" is nothing more than a poor excuse, for it is more than obvious that it is most often used by exactly those so-called international mediators whose entire range of activities in the "Yugoslav crisis" is calculated to a crawling rehabilitation of memorandum goals and thereby also of means used by the greater Serbian program headquarters in their conquest. For, regardless of the risk that the war might last as long as the one in Lebanon and be equally destructive for Bosnia-Herzegovina, Butrus-Ghali, Akashi, Juppe, Hurd..., not to mention Kozyrev, say it is OK as long as it is contained within the borders of "former Yugoslavia." Even the most naive observer, though, realizes at least three things: First, that the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- regardless of the developed phenomenology that came later on -- did not begin as a tribal conflict of everybody against everyone, but as an aggression (both in terms of ideas and implementation) of joined greater Serbian forces, from outside and inside, against Bosnia-Herzegovina as a territorial and political whole and against two indigenous nations which unambiguously opted for its survival at an independent address at a referendum. Second, the Bosnia-Herzegovina war did not spread to other areas of "former Yugoslavia" -- and to areas of early Yugoslav territory in particular -- only because that is theoretically not possible. The greater Serbian onslaught on Bosnia-Herzegovina is conceptually significantly different from the staged Yugo-army aggression against Slovenia, it is different from the Yugoslav-Serb assault on Croatia, and from the Serb-allied aggression that Milosevic's regime designed for Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. On the other hand, with regard to Kosovo, Sandzak, Vojvodina, Montenegro... as victims of greater Serbian aggression, those areas were occupied without war, "integrated" and Serbianized by means of a mixture of political and police terror and economic and social apartheid. The UN secretary general's fear -- and not only his -- that the war will spread beyond the borders of "former Yugoslavia" is based on utterly stretched speculations about the Balkanization and, subsequently, full internalization of the escalation of Serb state terror over the Kosovo Albanians and (or) the attempt to divide Macedonia among (all of) its neighbors. However, neither the Kosovo Albanians give any indications as to the limits of their humiliation, nor is Macedonia -- with U.S. (para-)UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Forces] soldiers deployed along the border with Serbia -- the prey one is allowed to reach for. All in all, Butrus-Ghali's going into raptures over containing the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina (Croatia was evidently forgotten as the side to which the UN owes everything but the protection of the terrorist part of its Serbian minority!) is nebulous, to say the least. His real purpose is to convince the victims of greater Serbian aggression that they have the privilege of using their misfortune (even if it is of a Lebanese kind) to contribute to peace in the neighborhood of former Yugoslav territory. True to such interpretations of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, i.e. of the "Yugoslav crisis" in general, Butrus Butrus-Ghali justifies the impotence of the UN to alleviate the suffering of the people and destruction caused by Serb acts of savagery by saying that, instead of 35,000 "blue helmets," he was only given 10,000. This is, again, not just a poor excuse but a very hypocritical one indeed, for as long as the secretary general himself is toying with the definition of the war, identification of the aggressor, and with imperative resolutions of his own house, being very careful not to smear his hands with truth, and as long as his plenipotentiary holds bandit leaders on Pale and in Knin to be "peacemakers" (and they have, naturally, became his "friends"!), it is more than obvious that the number of peacekeeping soldiers is not important, but the induced impotence of political decisions about using those soldiers on the ground is. Of course, it would be wrong -- considering the number of people who should be given credit -- to lay all the blame for "Yugoslav mistakes" of international factors on the UN secretary general. However, his is the grandiose contribution to the tragedy on the territory of former Yugoslavia in that his actions were clear and biased and especially in the fact that he gave himself the privilege, as the first secretary of the world organization, to make independent decisions on the level of the president of the government of the world, which gives a special meaning to his lethal, though sincere, delusions.
