(3) Airplanes equipped with one of the following Teledyne Continental Motors model or model series engines: ␣ 1␣ 1␣ 1␣ O&hyph;470 IO&hyph;470 TSIO&hyph;470 O&hyph;520 IO&hyph;520 TSIO&hyph;520 GTSIO&hyph;520 IO&hyph;550 TSIO&hyph;550 Cessna has issued Service Bulletin (SB) SEB93&hyph;1, dated January 29, 1993, which specifies procedures for inspecting the engine oil filter and adapter assembly. Oil filter and assembly installation procedures and torque values are included in the applicable Cessna maintenance manual. After examining the circumstances and reviewing all available information related to the incidents described above including the referenced service instructions, the FAA has determined that AD action should be taken to prevent loss of engine oil caused by loose or separated oil filter adapters, which could result in engine stoppage while in flight and loss of control of the airplane. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other airplanes utilizing a Cessna engine oil filter adapter, part number 0450404&hyph;1, 0450404&hyph;3, 0556004&hyph;1, 0556010&hyph;1, 1250403&hyph;6, 1250922&hyph;1, or 1250922&hyph;2, of the same type design, the proposed AD would require (1) applying torque paint between the engine filter adapter assembly, nut, and oil pump housing; (2) inspecting the oil filter and adapter assembly for oil leakage and proper installation of the adapter retaining nut and fretting of associated threads (security), and replacing any oil filter and adapter assembly with oil leakage or security problems; and (3) repetitively inspecting the torque paint for cracks or misalignment, and reinspecting the oil filter and adapter assembly if torque paint cracks or misalignment is found. The FAA estimates that 70,000 airplanes in the U.S. registry incorporate this engine oil filter and assembly and would be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take approximately 1 workhour per airplane to accomplish the proposed initial inspection and torque paint application, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $3,850,000. This cost is based on the assumption that no operator has accomplished the initial inspection, and does not take into account the cost for repetitive inspections. The FAA has no way of determining how many repetitive inspections each individual operator would incur. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
