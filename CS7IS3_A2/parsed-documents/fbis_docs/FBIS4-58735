With the signing of this accord, which defines the manner of implementing a limited autonomy for the Palestinians in Jericho and the Gaza Strip, the Israeli forces will withdraw from these areas and delegate their control to Palestinian policemen. After the Arab-Israeli war in 1967, these areas were occupied by the Zionist forces. The signatories of the Gaza-Jericho accord and their main supporters are seeking to magnify the importance of the signing of the accord as an end to the Middle East crisis and a solution to the Palestine issue. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who is in the Middle East to consolidate the process of compromise and was present at the signing of the document on the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord, lauded it as a historic accord. He added that it indicates that the two sides are in favor of putting the era of war and violence behind them, which engulfed the area for many years. 'Arafat described this accord as an infrastructure for peace in the region, and the Zionist regime's prime minister said it would pave the way for peace. The combatant Palestinian groups proclaimed a day of mourning and a general strike and declared today a black day. They have openly displayed their opposition to the Gaza-Jericho accord and have stressed the continuation of their struggle until the vindication of the true rights of the Palestinians. The factor that has motivated the authors of the Gaza-Jericho accord to view it as a means to put the Middle East conflict behind them is that they believe that by propounding a limited autonomy plan in this region they have catered to the Palestinian wishes for an independent government and have doused their fervor for a Palestinian homeland. The Islamic nature of the Palestinian territories is a strong reality that has retained its luster despite the years of occupation and the homelessness of its citizens and efforts to destroy their identity. On the basis of this reality, the establishment of an independent government, which should reflect this identity, is a historical demand of the Palestinians that must be achieved or struggles will continue. In view of this irrefutable reality, the formulators of this compromise have attempted to delegate a small segment of the Palestinian homeland with limited autonomy to placate the people of Palestine and the world. It remains to be seen whether the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord can bring about peace and compromise between the Zionist regime and the Palestinian people. The Palestinians seek the establishment of a government that protects and upholds all Palestinian characteristics, embraces the entire Palestinian population, encompasses the entire historical Palestinian homeland, and enjoys complete and comprehensive sovereignty. The autonomy propounded on the basis of the compromise between 'Arafat and the Zionist regime does not have any of these characteristics. This will result in opposition by a large section of the Palestinian population. The declaration of opposition by the Palestinian groups and a general strike by the intifadah commanders on the day the document for the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord was signed is eloquent testimony of this fact. On the other hand, in light of the expansionist nature of the Zionist regime, one can say that it does not even consider itself obligated to abide by the limited agreements in the accord signed. The killings of Muslim worshipers in the al-Khalil [Hebron] mosque proved that this regime, along with those participating in the talks, constantly gives vent to its savage nature so that it can restrict the Palestinian Muslims even more. The massacre of Muslims by the Zionists took place when this regime constantly referred to the Palestinian people's struggles as extremist actions that disrupt the so-called peace process. The Zionist regime calls on the obsequious leaders of the compromise to rein in these actions. Thus, it may be said that despite the signing of the compromising accord the Zionist regime ignores it whenever it deems fit so that it can attain its expansionist objectives. What is obvious is that the Palestinian issue can only be resolved when a government that reflects the Palestinian identity of the people of these territories is established with complete integrity and the holy land of Jerusalem is liberated completely from the occupation by the Zionist usurpers. Otherwise, the Palestinian nation and the Islamic world will not relinquish their demands and the defeat of plans such as the Gaza-Jericho accord, which was established on unstable foundations, will be imminent.
