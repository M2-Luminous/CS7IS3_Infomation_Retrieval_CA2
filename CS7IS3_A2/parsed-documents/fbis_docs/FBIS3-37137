They are to replace the fighters of the Ukrainian battalion who have already served their time in U.N. Peacekeeping Forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina. According to Commander of the Odessa Military District Vladimir Shkidchenko, the current rotation is not a usual one, since a unit of Ukrainian volunteers will for the first time include eight women, largely surgical nurses. Earlier, Ukrainian servicemen had to seek for medical assistance in American and German hospitals and to pay for this in hard currency. The Ukrainian parliament passed a decision to increase the numerical strength of the Ukrainian battalion in Bosnia-Herzegovina up to 1,220 fighters, the commander reported. Preparations for this have already got underway, including on the basis of the Nikolayev garrison's training centre.
