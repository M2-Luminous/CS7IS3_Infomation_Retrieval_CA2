His worst moment came when Tory maverick back-bencher Tony Marlow sent a shudder through the Chamber with a stark public demand that he should quit Downing Street and make way for someone who would provide leadership. [passage omitted] The Commons storm -- one of the most savage for months -- was the climax of a dramatic day during which the Cabinet faced an ultimatum to respond by six o'clock tonight to a compromise plan drawn up by the Greeks who hold the EU presidency. And in Brussels tonight, European Commission President Jacques Delors poured cold water on Mr Major's claims of new concessions by the EU as a "sweetener" in the battle over voting rights. He said he had simply clarified, at Britain's request, the Commission's interpretation of Euro-social policy. And Irish Commissioner Padraig Flynn insisted that no concessions of any kind had been approved to soften the blow to Britain of conceding more voting rights to Brussels. Now Tory Euro-critics are on the warpath again, egged on by Mr Marlow, as the Government -- after talking tough only a week ago -- appears to be bending the knee to the Brussels bureaucracy machine. [passage omitted] Mr Major's already insecure position, almost certainly the biggest threat to his leadership since he swept to power, was made worse by denials in Brussels that Britain had been given guarantees overnight that no social legislation would be sneaked in "by the back door." Mr Delors, asked if anything had changed as a result of talks with the British Government, replied: "No, no. I simply clarified the programme of the Commission for the present year and also the interpretation of the social protocol, that is all." Mr Flynn said: "There was no such concession or change in policy." He went on: "Nothing of that nature could take place without my agreement and my agreement was neither sought nor given." Commission officials were pointing out tonight that even if concessions had been given they would apply only to 1994 -- and the voting changes which would be affected by any concessions do not come in until 1995. Mr Delors made it clear that he, presiding over a Commission which stands down at the end of this year, could not make any special arrangements with Britain which would bind a future Commission. But Downing Street officials later repudiated the denial of any guarantees, producing documents to say that these undertakings had in fact been given. The Prime Minister, who looked distinctly uncomfortable during the Commons exchanges, bluntly told Mr Smith: "What you appear to have overlooked is that we have achieved a series of concessions that would not have been available if we had adopted your position of accepting, without let or hindrance, 27 for all areas immediately. ``We have not achieved the maintenance of the blocking majority of 23. I would have ideally preferred that. But neither have the other member states achieved what they would have wished -- for we have obtained concessions particularly that protect our most vulnerable flank on social affairs.'' Michael Heseltine, who is fast becoming the favourite to succeed Mr Major, airily brushed aside any thoughts of a challenge from him in the autumn. "We've been over that ground and I'm bored to distraction by it," he told Channel 4 News. He claimed there was widespread support for Mr Major, saying: "I saw it demonstrated extremely eloquently in Plymouth where there were hundreds of Conservatives gathered for a very successful conference on Saturday. I have not the slightest doubt that that is testimony to what the party and the country thinks, and I have not the slightest doubt that the party and the House of Commons is determined to back the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secetary on what has been a difficult, hard fought negotiation." The President of the Board of Trade denied the Government had given in over its battle with the EU. He said: "It is a detailed negotiation in which Douglas Hurd has won a commendable negotiating success in British interests, and the only party that fought that battle was the Conservative Party." But many Tories feel that John Major has himself created a personal crisis by building up expectations of a bitter battle with Brussels over voting rights -- and then not fulfilling them. And in Westminster tonight, some furious Tory backbenchers believe the Prime Minister has bound a future British government to a European Union with ever-increasing legal authority over a sovereign power.
