FR941213-0-00048 FR941213-0-00010 Comment: One commenter wanted us to require that the discharge plan be entered into the medical record. Response: The State surveyors, in determining compliance with this condition, will look at whether the hospital developed discharge plans for patients who needed them and whether the hospital arranged for its initial implementation. The hospital will be expected to be able to document its decision about the need for a plan, document the existence of plans where they are needed and show what steps it took to implement those plans initially. In our view, the hospital has the latitude to accomplish this result in the most efficient way possible. We do not believe that the discharge plan, which may contain information already in the medical record in the form of clinical notes, for example, is always an essential part of the patient's formal medical record. We recognize that the JCAHO requires that the discharge plan be entered into the medical record, and that many hospitals may do it, but we do not believe that making this mandatory in all cases would serve a useful purpose. Comment: Several commenters remarked about the requirement in §482.43(c)(4) concerning periodic reassessment; one commenter thought that the reassessment should be based on changes in the patient's condition or progress. Another commenter wanted to know how the periodic reassessment differs from an assessment on an as-needed basis. The third commenter believed that the requirement, as written, could apply after discharge and the regulation needs to specify that the reassessment occurs before discharge. Response: We are modifying proposed §482.43(c)(4) to require reassessments on an as-needed basis, based on factors that may affect continuing care needs or the appropriateness of the discharge plan. We do not agree that the regulation needs to specify that the reassessment must be done before discharge. The duty for discharge planning ends after discharge, assuming the hospital has arranged for the initial implementation of the Medicare patient's discharge plans in accordance with §482.43(c)(3) and has transferred or referred the patient in accordance with §482.43(d). Comment: One commenter wanted us to specify predetermined times at which the patient and family must be counseled to prepare for post-hospital care, rather than requiring this counseling on an as-needed basis. Response: We do not agree that we should be so specific. Hospital personnel are in the best position to judge the best times to counsel the patient and family and to accommodate individual situations. Comment: One commenter thought we should avoid over-utilization of family caregiving systems and use more non-family-based community resources. Response: Use of family caregivers occurs in discharge planning only when the family is both willing and able to perform needed services. In the absence of such a commitment, it is appropriate to use community resources that are not family-based. Comment: One commenter thought there is a need for greater identification of the caregiver in the discharge planning process; in each case, the commenter suggested, we should require the hospital to determine whether there is a caregiver, the caregiver's willingness and ability to provide care, and mechanisms for preparing families to provide the care. Another commenter, on the other hand, expressed concern that the regulation text inappropriately advocates the use of family caregivers in situations where community-based services are available and that we are not providing the patient his or her choice in such situations. Response: We agree that identification of family or other caregiver is a key attribute of effective discharge planning and believe that our regulations at 42 CFR 482.43(b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(6) and (c)(5) both appropriately and in a balanced manner relate to this need. More specific information on the role of the caregiver will be included in the interpretive guidelines, including provision of specialized instruction or training in post-hospital care. Transfer and Referral Comment: We received four comments on our requirement that a hospital must discharge or transfer the patient after executing a discharge plan. One commenter thought we were going beyond the intent of the statute and that few hospitals have the authority to transfer or refer patients; one thought our statement that the statute did not require discharge or transfer to be misleading; and two commenters were in favor of the provision. Response: While it is true that the statute does not explicitly require the hospital to follow through and actually discharge or transfer the patient, we believe the requirement is implicit in the purpose of the legislation: to assure that patients receive proper post-hospital care. This requirement, as with other conditions of participation, must operate within the constraints of a hospital's authority under State law and within the limits of a patient's right to refuse discharge planning services. As we stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, the proposed requirement is not new and has been in place for some time. Comment: One commenter remarked that we should strengthen the regulation by requiring hospital discharge planning personnel to maintain complete and accurate information on community long-term care services and facilities for advising patients and their representatives of their options. Response: We do not believe a change in the regulation is warranted. The current outcome-oriented standard is sufficient and in accord with the regulatory approach used in the June 17, 1986 revision to the conditions of participation for hospitals. Hospitals will be able to choose from many methods to demonstrate compliance with the standard. We will incorporate the commenter's suggested language in the interpretive guidelines for the standard and for the on-going reassessment of the hospital's discharge planning process required in §482.43(e). Comment: One commenter questioned whether §482.43(d), which requires the hospital to transfer necessary medical information along with the patient for post-hospital services, is compatible with §482.24(b)(3), which requires release of information only to authorized individuals. Response: 42 CFR 482.24(b)(3) requires that the hospital have a procedure for insuring confidentiality of patient records. Information from or copies of records must be released only to authorized individuals and the hospital must ensure that unauthorized individuals cannot gain access to or alter patient records. Original medical records must be released by the hospital only in accordance with Federal or State laws, court orders, or subpoenas. Since proposed §482.43(d) has been in effect as §482.21(b)(2) (beginning September 15, 1986), there has been no conflict with §482.24(b)(3) and we do not anticipate any problems when §482.43(d) becomes effective as a final rule. ``Necessary medical information'' has not been interpreted in our guidelines as requiring transmission of the patient's medical record.
