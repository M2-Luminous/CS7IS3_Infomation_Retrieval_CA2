On 15 June, however, during a meeting with the leaders of Amur Oblast, President B. Yeltsin gave a different figure. Speaking about the reform of the Army, he declared that its strategic goal is a reduction from 3 million to 1.5 million men. So just how many men are serving in the Russian Army, and what is its authorized strength? In order to answer these questions, we turned to the Ministry of Defense for an explanation. It turned out that the ministry itself had not prepared or passed to the president any data on the size of the Armed Forces during these days. In the opinion of the military, the discrepancy in the figures which the president has now given and which the Defense Ministry has announced at various times arose because account is not always taken, when talking of the Army's quantitative composition, of the fact that numerical strength is subdivided into authorized strength (the number of posts provided for by the prescribed strength level) and actual strength (the number of servicemen actually fulfilling duties). At the same time the authorized and actual strengths change constantly. For example, as of 1 May 1992 the prescribed strength level stood at 2.8 million servicemen, and the roster at just over 2 million. The difference between the prescribed strength level and the actual strength constituted the degree of undermanning. In the opinion of Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff, when speaking in Amur Oblast the president might have had in mind all those who wear military uniform in Russia. But these are servicemen not only of the Defense Ministry but also of other ministries and departments. "In particular," M. Kolesnikov continued, "there are the border troops, who number 50,000 men, the internal troops with 350,000 men, and the railroad troops with 70,000. The Ministry of Communications, the Dalstroy [expansion unknown], and the Moscow Special Construction Trust have their own military subunits. In all, approximately 800,000 men in addition to the Defense Ministry. If you add this number to our composition, you will get a total of almost 3 million." [Burbyga] What is the specific strength of the Armed Forces as of 16 June? [Kolesnikov] We have reduced them by 700,000 in the course of two years. The authorized strength today is 2.002 million men. But the actual strength is considerably less. [Burbyga] How many of them are generals? The largest number in the world, so the newspapers write? [Kolesnikov] I would not dramatize this question. Speaking of the world, we hold the "golden" mean, as it were. For comparison: We have twice as many generals per serviceman as the United States and China, but half the number of Britain and France. We have provided for a significant reduction in generals' posts. Whereas there were 4,343 of them in 1989, 2,070 are now left. A reduction to 1,780 is envisaged in the long term. [Burbyga] The Army is frequently rebuked for reforming itself only slowly. Can the Armed Forces be reduced more quickly? [Kolesnikov] Reform is primarily the business and concern of the state and the executive, not of the Army itself. We can take the role of experts and executors. For some reason the reform has been entrusted to us today. But all the executive's attention to the reforms is limited to the following demand: Carry out reduction more quickly.... But the Army needs considerable funds to carry out the reform, and we do not have them. It is a paradox, but it is more advantageous to us to transfer an officer to the reserve than to discharge him. This is because, before discharging an officer, it is necessary to pay him a posting allowance, to provide him with housing.... Otherwise there could be a sharp increase in social tension in society. [Burbyga] It was reported recently that 25-30 people in the Army die every day for one reason or another. Is this so? [Kolesnikov] There are people who have made themselves a career out of speculating with such figures. But the reality is that an average of three or four people die in the Army every day for various reasons. There are road transport accidents, injuries, suicides.... In 1992 1,746 servicemen died, in 1993 1,359, and this year 417. We deeply regret every loss and death and endeavor to take all measures to avoid tragedies. [Burbyga] A final question: How is your relationship with Army General Pavel Grachev, minister of defense? There are many contradictory rumors about this. [Kolesnikov] I will say bluntly that I cannot count myself among the minister's personal friends. But we have a good working relationship. The first report to the minister every day is mine. I give him personally the most important documents. He signs the overwhelming majority of them. This attests to his trust both in me and in the General Staff.
