FR941202-0-00022 FR941202-0-00001 IV. Administrative Statements Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability The Commission has determined under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in Subpart A of 10 CFR Part 51, that this final amendment is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, and therefore an environmental impact statement is not required. The final amendment provides greater flexibility for physician authorized users to use byproduct material in the practice of medicine. The final amendment will also incorporate into the regulations the concept of authorized nuclear pharmacists to permit properly qualified pharmacists to prepare radioactive drugs containing byproduct material in the practice of pharmacy. The final rule will allow physician authorized users greater discretion to prepare and use radioactive drugs containing byproduct material. The final rule will also allow authorized nuclear pharmacists greater discretion to prepare radioactive drugs containing byproduct material. It is expected that there will be no increase in radiation exposure to the public or to the environment beyond the exposures currently resulting from delivering the byproduct material or radiation from byproduct material to patients or human research subjects. The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact on which this determination is based is available for inspection at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of the environmental assessment and the finding of no significant impact are available from Anthony N. Tse (see FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT heading). Paperwork Reduction Act Statement This final rule amends information collection requirements that are subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq). These requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget, approval numbers 3150&hyph;0001 and 3150&hyph;0010 for amendments to 10 CFR Parts 32 and 35, respectively. The reduction in public burden for this collection of information is estimated to be a savings of 408 hours per year for 300 NRC licensees, or an average 1.4 hours per year per licensee, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Information and Records Management Branch (T&hyph;6 F33), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and to the Desk Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, NEOB&hyph;10202, (3150&hyph;0001, -0010, and -0120), Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503. Regulatory Analysis The Commission has prepared a final regulatory analysis on this regulation. The analysis examines the benefits and impacts considered by the Commission. No public comments were received on the draft regulatory analysis associated with the proposed rule. The final regulatory analysis is available for inspection at the NRC Public Document Room at 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of the draft analysis are available from Anthony N. Tse (see FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT heading). Regulatory Flexibility Certification As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commission certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule affects medical use licensees including some private practice physicians. Some of these licensees would be considered small entities under the NRC's size standards (56 FR 56671; November 6, 1991). The amendments provide greater discretion for physician authorized users to use byproduct material in the practice of medicine. The amendments will also incorporate into the regulations the concept of authorized nuclear pharmacists to allow properly qualified pharmacists greater discretion to prepare (including compound) radioactive drugs containing byproduct material for medical use. This rule is expected to reduce regulatory burdens on medical use licensees, including small entities. No public comments were received related to the regulatory flexibility certification associated with the proposed rule.
