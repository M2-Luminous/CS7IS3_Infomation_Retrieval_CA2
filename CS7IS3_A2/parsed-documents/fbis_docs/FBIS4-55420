This morning and evening they shelled the outlying districts of Cazin. Members of the traitor Kladusa paramilitary [Fikret Abdic's forces] have been attacking the outer rim of Cazin and Todorovo. Their artillery continued to pound civilian targets in the wake of their failed attempts at infantry forays along a large stretch of the demarcation line. There is again a large number of civilian casualties following these murderous attacks. There is also a great deal of material damage.
