The leaflet warns of the possibility that some evangelical leaders could try to influence voters' decisions, and upholds the moral standards of the candidates. The leaflet states: "No evangelical voter should feel bad because he disagrees with his pastor or spiritual leader." The text states that the vote for president should be based on government programs. It also condemns the spreading of rumors, such as those against Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva during the 1989 elections. The leaflet approves of the religious vote. If the voter feels that he or she identifies with the candidate, but not with his party, the leaflet recommends: "It is suggested that even so, a vote of support be given to our fellow believer as long as he qualifies for the post." The AEVB is identified as the most progressive sector of the evangelical community. It opposes the National Ministers Council, which is linked to the IURD (Universal Church of the Kingdom of God) headed by Bishop Edir Macedo, and is a dissident faction of the Assembly of God. The IURD rejects Lula. The last issue of FOLHA UNIVERSAL carries an article stating that the PT [Workers Party] upholds the legalization of abortion and homosexuality. The article said that the PT "is the product of the Roman clergy, and is at the service of the interests that have always prevailed in the history of the Roman Catholic Church." IURD state Deputy Paulo Cesar De Velasco says the church intends to support one candidate. He commented: "It will not be Lula, nor will it be Brizola." Quercia is the only candidate praised by De Velasco: "His running mate [Iris Resende] is evangelical and uses language that can be understood by the people." De Velasco believes Fernando Henrique Cardoso is "inconsistent" from the religious viewpoint.
