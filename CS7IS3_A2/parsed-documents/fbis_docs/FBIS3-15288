Speaking at a meeting with editors-in-chief of leading Russian periodicals in Moscow on Thursday [3 March], Rybkin said the state Duma will support the mass media and free it from "the pressure of strict economic censorship." He suggested setting up a working group to draw up a draft law on the operation of mass media in 1994-1995. Rybkin believes the group should include Pavel Gusev, editor-in-chief of MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS, Igor Golembiovsky, editor-in-chief of IZVESTIYA, Shod Muladzhanov and representatives of news agencies and television and radio companies. The participants in the meeting blamed the current difficulties on the monopoly of the Ministry of Communications and the impossibility for the employees of publishing houses to privatise their enterprises. Gusev, who is also chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists, called for urgent changes in the system of state financing of publications and creation of equal conditions for their survival. Rybkin said the draft law on mass media in 1994-1995 which should help the press pull through the current crisis is expected to be discussed by the State Duma at the end of April.
