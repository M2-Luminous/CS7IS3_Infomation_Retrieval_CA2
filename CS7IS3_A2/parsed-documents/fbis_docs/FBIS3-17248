He emphasized that the matter has been suspended only until Konstantin Mavrin, general procuracy investigator for particularly important matters, arrives in Vladivostok. Kravtsov's Duma statement resulted in the chamber's decision to hear the General Procuracy of the Russian Federation's representative on the Vladivostok events, regarding the instigation of criminal proceedings against the city's mayor on bribery charges. Kravtsov also said the matter against Cherepkov was instigated on 10 February this year. The size of the bribe was quoted to be 3 million rubles. A portion of the money, which incidentally was marked by the bribe-giver, was found in the mayor's office. According to the deputy general procurator, the bribe-giver is someone without fixed abode or employment. According to Kravtsov, the hand over of the bribe, notification by the bribe-giver that the money had been handed over, and instigation of proceedings against Cherepkov, all occurred on 10 February.
