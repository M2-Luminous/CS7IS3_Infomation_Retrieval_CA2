He added: Although war actions taking place a few kilometers from our border with Mexico are dangerous, Guatemala could benefit from the armed movement in that country, because if the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity supports openly that movement it will lose the sympathy that it has enjoyed in Mexico during certain moments. Herbruger said during a news conference that he thinks it is important for our country to adopt certain precautionary measures to protect its border, without interfering in Mexico's domestic affairs. The Guatemalan official believes that the Mexicans will react negatively to the armed movement, because the people who live in countries with constitutional regimes do not welcome violent changes. Meanwhile, Presidency Secretary General Hector Luna Troccoli has said that the armed movement that has reemerged in Mexico is a source of concern, because it threatens that country's political stability, which has been traditional for over 60 years. He added: It must be admitted, however, that the uprising is understandable due to the extreme poverty in which the people of Mexico's northern and southeastern region live, and this situation, added to the political wear out of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, has caused the situation that exists now. Meanwhile, Felix Loarca Guzman, public relations secretary of the Presidency, has said that the guerrilla movement in Mexico is a domestic matter of that country and the Guatemalan Government cannot issue any opinion in that regard.
