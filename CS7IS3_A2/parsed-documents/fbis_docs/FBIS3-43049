The possible consequences of impacts of bodies with a diameter from 100 m to 1 km is examined; the altitude of rising of the cloud is estimated for an impact with an energy 10-30 megatons. The physical picture of the resulting effects is discussed in detail. With the impact of meteor bodies with an energy in the indicated range a break is formed in the tropopause and dust surges into the upper layers of the atmosphere. With an increase in the mass of the impacting body, and accordingly, an increase in the energy of the explosion by two or three orders of magnitude, there is a change in the very character of rising of the dust cloud because instead of a turbulent cloud rising relatively slowly under the influence of Archimedes force a high-velocity plasma of the space body and ground (with the mass of the latter being greater than that of the space body itself) escapes into the upper layers of the atmosphere. The atmospheric dust content will be determined to a considerable degree by condensation processes. Only in the late stages will there be a slower ejection of melt and finely dispersed dust to lesser altitudes, but nevertheless above the tropopause. Additional atmospheric pollution will occur due to the great fires arising under the influence of thermal radiation. Figures 4; references 15: 1 Russian, 14 Western.
