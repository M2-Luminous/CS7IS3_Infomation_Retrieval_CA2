As far as the economic part of the discussion is concerned, "Russia is not raising the issue about fully-fledged participation in (what would be a) G-8", he stressed and added that there should be no haste in the issue. "However, it is not ruled out that at the next after Naples meeting the issue of a full-scale Russian participation in the economic programme of the Big Seven would be raised", he said. He also stressed that Boris Yeltsin is preparing for the Naples summit and details will be discussed during his talks with the French and British foreign ministers.
