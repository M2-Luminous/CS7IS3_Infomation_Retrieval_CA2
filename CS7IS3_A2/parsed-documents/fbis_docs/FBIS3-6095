Top Secret Scenario for a `Keiseikai New Party' in Second Act of Realignment"] [Text] Former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, whose influence had grown much weaker, along with that of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], has once again begun to move. He has given up on the LDP and plans formation of a new party based on the Obuchi faction (Keiseikai), of which he is the originator. A Diet member who belongs to the Obuchi faction reveals it. "The idea is that, as the first step, Takeshita will change the identity of the Keiseikai to that of a policy group, not a faction. In order to do that, he will abolish the name Keiseikai and will also close its traditional office in the Sabo Kaikan Building. Having done that, he will call people from other factions as well, hold a study meeting on policy, and make it into a new party at one stroke. Kajiyama is promoting this Keiseikai breakup plan under Takeshita's direction." The Keiseikai has a tradition that goes back to Eisaku Sato, so for it to leave the Sabo Kaikan, which the Tanaka and Takeshita factions made their stronghold, is probably a manifestation of extraordinary resolve. The Sabo Kaikan was also a symbol of the conservative mainstream. We are talking about Takeshita, who turns every situation to his profit. He has an intricate ulterior purpose in this concept of a new party. According to more than one member of the Keiseikai, the blueprint of the Takeshita-Kajiyama line is as follows: First, by taking the lead in liquidating factions, which people have not been able to actually embark upon, although everyone speaks of it as one of the party reforms, Takeshita and Kajiyama will be able to wipe their slates completely clean. Next, it will sweep Diet members of other factions into the net under the pretext of a study group, without actually breaking up the organization of the Keiseikai. Then, when the Keiseikai has built in scale to 100 members, the formation of a new party; and by that Takeshita will seize, at one stroke, the leadership in realignment of the political landscape--of course, the aim of crushing Shinseito President Ichiro Ozawa is also concealed within this. Practically speaking, there is virtually no prospect of the LDP recovering a majority in the next general election. Moreover, because of regard for how such a move would appear to the nation, it is difficult to conceive of a party that would form a coalition with the LDP in its present state. Such being the case, its options for getting back into the center of governing power are limited. "The only course open is to break up the LDP and make each of the present factions into a new party. And then create a liberal democratic alliance and form a coalition government with such parties as Sakigake [Harbinger] and the Japan New Party" (LDP Diet member). In point of fact, Takeshita and Kajiyama have been making appeals to all quarters in order to translate this plan into reality. At the end of 1993, they telephoned Prime Minister Hosokawa any number of times to transmit their intention of forming a Keiseikai new party; and on 23 December, at Takeshita's strong request, a top secret meeting was realized at the Hotel Okura. At the meeting, while hinting at Prime Minister Hosokawa's scandals involving money and women, which have not yet come to public attention, Takeshita made a proposal, saying, "The coalition government will probably not last long either. Ozawa's Shinseito and Komeito do not fit in with your views of the constitution or your image of politics in the future. Next time let us form a government together." Meanwhile, Kajiyama is said to be contacting SDPJ [Social Democratic Party of Japan] Chairman Murayama frequently and appealing for a cooperative relationship and establishment of a coalition government in the future. The greatest obstacle to Takeshita and Kajiyama's plan, however, is still the existence of Ichiro Ozawa because Ozawa is also appealing to all quarters for participation in a coalition government. In particular, a fierce struggle has developed over Michio Watanabe. Watanabe, who is being courted by both Takeshita and Ozawa, disclosed to a close associate, "I will join whichever one will support me (for prime minister)." In any case, it seems likely that the malice that has existed since the breakup of the Takeshita faction will also exert great influence on the upcoming second act of the realignment of the political map.
