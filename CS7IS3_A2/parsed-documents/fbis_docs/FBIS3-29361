FBIS3-29361 "dreas033_d_94018" FBIS-EAS-94-033 Document Type:Daily Report 17 Feb 1994 South Korea Government Plans To Suspend Team Spirit Exercise SK1702074694 Seoul YONHAP in English 0724 GMT 17 Feb 94 SK1702074694 Seoul YONHAP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Seoul, Feb. 17 (YONHAP) -- The government will announce a conditional suspension of this year's "Team Spirit" military exercise with the United States next week when an outside nuclear inspection team arrives in North Korea, while seeking to resume low-level dialogue with Pyongyang on an exchange of special envoys, officials said Thursday. At the same time, North Korea and the United States will announce plans for a third round of high-level talks on improving bilateral relations. The government's announcement on Team Spirit will state that the joint South Korea-U.S. field maneuvers would be suspended if the International Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] inspections of North Korean nuclear sites and the working-level inter-Korean dialogue proceeded smoothly, according to the officials. These were among the topics discussed Thursday at two meetings of unification-related ministers on inter-Korean relations after Pyongyang's decision Wednesday to permit IAEA inspections. One meeting was presided over by Unification Minister Yi Yong-tok and the other by Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang. The U.S. announcement on plans for a third round of high-level talks with North Korea will contain the same conditions as those in the South Korean statement on Team Spirit's suspension, the officials said. The government will seek to exchange special envoys with North Korea next month, with an eye to solving the North Korean nuclear issue initially and then to implementing the basic North-South agreement and arranging reunions for separated families. But the government will prepare for the possibility that North Korea might hinder the IAEA inspections or stall on resuming inter-Korean dialogue to buy time for its nuclear arms program, the officials said. Seoul and Washington both maintain that an exchange of special envoys between North and South Korea must take place before the next high-level North Korea-U.S. talks, they added. There will be no other form of inter-Korean contact but the exchange of special envoys, an official said. Another official said, however, it was unlikely that the initial exchange of visits by the two Koreas' special envoys would precede the high-level North Korea-U.S. talks, adding that a visit by one side to the other could meet the condition for resuming high-level discussions between Washington and Pyongyang.
