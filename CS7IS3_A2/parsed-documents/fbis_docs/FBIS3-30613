Is it true? [Gligorov] Bulgaria is a neighbor country with which we have an open border and free traffic. Both we and the Bulgarians are observing the sanctions, which does not mean that cases of busting the Yugo-embargo do not occasionally occur. Nevertheless, Macedonia, being an UN member, respects the sanctions. [STANDART NEWS] After the recognition of the Republic of Macedonia, what will be the next steps on the international scene? [Gligorov] Recognition is of great importance to us. After Macedonia was admitted to the UN, our country officially established its identity as an independent state recognized by the international organizations and participating legitimately in international life. We shall pursue our efforts to establish diplomatic relations with all countries. We welcome the initiative of integrating the countries of Central and Eastern Europe with the "Partnership for Peace" initiative. We sent a letter to the Brussels summit in which we declared our intention of participating in the relevant meeting. [STANDART NEWS] Do you have a clear concept on solving the problem with Greece? [Gligorov] As far as we are concerned, the problem could be easily resolved as long as we discuss it, as long as we take the peace and stability of the Balkans into consideration, and as long as we behave like sensible people who can settle all their controversial problems as good neighbors should. Actually, we have no great controversies and territorial claims [regarding Greece]. The borders are determined and recognized by both sides. The other problems are rather based on emotional and historical motivations and should not even be on the agenda. It is our wish to pursue our diplomatic negotiations with Greece. [STANDART NEWS] Macedonia is not a member of the Council of Europe as yet. What is being done to speed up its admission? [Gligorov] We have the status of a country specially invited by the European Council of Ministers, which, only a few days ago, decided to start the procedure of admitting Macedonia as a full member to the organization. Macedonia is a member of the Central European Initiative, which includes Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia, and Austria. [STANDART NEWS] Do you think that there is any danger involved in connection with Serbia's claims toward Macedonia? [Gligorov] Serbia should prove whether it has any claims regarding Macedonia or not by recognizing our country. As long as this has not occurred, we should be cautious and take into account the fact that political forces insisting on Macedonia not being an independent state still exist in Serbia. Macedonia is in favor of cooperation with all former Yugoslav republics and with all Balkan countries, but it is not inclined to join any closer alliance with Serbia, under the form of a confederation or under any other form of integration. The war has been going on too long in that part, too much blood has been shed, and one can hardly expect any form of political integration with that state, after Macedonia waged such a long and hard struggle for its own independence. We would like to build our country as an independent, sovereign, democratic, and rule-of-law state. [STANDART NEWS] What about Albania? [Gligorov] Basically, I do not see any danger stemming from that country. However, assuming that the armed conflict is likely to continue for some time, possible unrest in Kosovo cannot be excluded, since the problems of that area are still unresolved. Hence, we should be aware of what might happen in the future. [STANDART NEWS] Is it possible that Serbia might stimulate a threat from the Albanian side in the purpose of forcing Skopje to apply for Serbia's "protection." [Gligorov] I see no reason for Macedonia to seek an alliance with Serbia against Albania. Albanians who live in our country are Macedonians by Law. We saw what the ideas of greater Serbia, greater Albania, and greater Croatia have produced. We should live like peaceful neighbors. Albanians live in Macedonia, but Macedonians exist in Albania as well. Let them all exist as they did before, while the borders should be open and people be able to move freely from one country to the other. [STANDART NEWS] How do you accept the presence of U.S. soldiers in Macedonia? [Gligorov] Our relations with the United States are friendly. They are interested in peaceful relations with the Balkans. I assess the fact that they chose to station their military units in Macedonia as a preventive peace action. A peaceful and stable Macedonia is an obstacle to the expansion of the military conflict.
