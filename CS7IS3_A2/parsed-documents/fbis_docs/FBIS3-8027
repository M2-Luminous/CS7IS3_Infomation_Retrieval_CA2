[Hall] First, it is more than obvious that the government coalition has no cohesive program of state reforms. What they do is neither continuation of the work of their predecessors nor its demolition. On the other hand, in such areas as, say, reforms of the health service and the budget-funded sector, we can expect continuing stagnation. It is obvious that the process of privatization is already being hampered in its progress. Nor do I believe that the present government coalition is capable of successfully resisting public pressure. In contrast to this, we know that both Leszek Balcerowicz and Hanna Suchocka's entire government were perfectly able to take risks for the sake of certain overriding interests and were even prepared to enter into conflict with a substantial proportion of the general public for the sake of these interests. Today we cannot find any evidence of such firm principles. Finally, there is a clearly discernible return to the policy of making politically inspired appointments to key state offices. Such appointments are often entrusted to people who were politically active in the past, although not always in association with the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] or the Polish Peasant Party [PSL]. The government coalition promotes a vision of a strongly centralized state, with a powerful central administration. The way to counteract such ambitions is to give significant powers to local self-government structures and regional communities. This is our concept of running things. [Jurczak] But the president has expressed a strongly negative opinion of the political configuration existing outside the government coalition. [Hall] In my view, the president should refrain from using such strong expressions which are loaded with negative messages. On the other hand, it is true that very many politicians from the post-Solidarity camp have failed to pass the test as statesmen and leaders of the nation. I do not know whether the president was referring also to me in his utterance. I hope he was not. [Jurczak] To go back to your own patch, do you believe that Kazimierz Michal Ujazdowski was right when he accused you of attempting to cause a split in your party? [Hall] We are now well and truly "divorced," and a group of our former colleagues, including Mr. Ujazdowski, have left the Conservative Party. In any case, they are not a particularly large group, and in the past they demonstrated considerable political talent when they were setting up our party. Mr. Ujazdowski's future plans are precise and clear-cut: He intends to set up a compound political party together with the Christian National Union [ZChN], the Center Alliance [PC], and the PSL-Peasant Alliance. It is his God-given right to do so. We, on the other hand, intend to continue investing in the Conservative Party and a future conservative-liberal camp which should eventually be created in Poland. [Jurczak] Has your party worked out a strategy that could help you achieve success in the forthcoming local self-government elections? [Hall] We operate within the framework of an agreement between different political programs, dubbed the 11 November Agreement, but in the local self-government elections our structures will retain considerable freedom of maneuver as regards selection of political allies--excluding, of course, the ruling government coalition and Union of Labor. In order to be able to create wide-ranging political alliances, we should ideally set up alliance structures in every city, each embracing a spectrum of parties from the Democratic Union through the ZChN. This is because we will have a very strong adversary on the other side, namely the SLD in urban centers and the PSL in the rural sector. This challenge will oblige us to concentrate our forces. That will not be possible everywhere, but I believe that such a tactic will be most desirable. Moreover, I believe that it is improper practice to change the electoral law at short notice before the elections; I believe that the local self-government elections should be conducted on the base of the old electoral law, which is, in any case, still in force today. [Jurczak] Thank you for talking to us.
