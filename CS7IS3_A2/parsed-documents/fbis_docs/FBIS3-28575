This was Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo's reaction to Senator Arturo Tolentino's pronouncement that the country has renounced its claim to Sabah, which was relayed by the president to Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamed: [Begin Tolentino recording in progress, in English] ...it's on border problems with the Philippines. Formerly, Mr. Mahathir said that unless the Sabah claim is dropped, he would not step again on Philippine soil. And he would not negotiate any treaties such as border agreements unless the Sabah claim is dropped. Now he has come here. He seems to be a very happy man and even went to the extent of giving a gift of an automobile to our president in exchange of a Timex watch. This means that he is very happy now, and the only explanation for his satisfaction is that the Sabah irritant has already been withdrawn. [end recording] Romulo said, however, that this is not true and that the government has no intention of giving up its claim to Sabah. Romulo added that the Malaysian Government is ready to help the Sultan of Sulu's heirs with their territorial claim. [sentence as heard] [Begin Romulo recording, in English] I believe that was brought up in the context of a conversation of the president with Dr. Mahathir. I cannot give you any further enlightenment on that. I assure you that there is no agreement on Sabah at this point in time. It was more the desire of the president to help the heirs of Sabah above and beyond the nominal rental that is being paid now. [end recording]
