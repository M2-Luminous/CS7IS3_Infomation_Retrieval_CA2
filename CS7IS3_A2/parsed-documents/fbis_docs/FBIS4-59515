The report came as northern leaders rejected as "nothing new" a seven-point ceasefire plan put forward by their southern counterparts. Northern troops advanced in the town of al-Dali', 90 kilometers (55 miles) north of Aden, which controls one of the main routes to the former southern capital, SABA' news agency quoted him as saying. Reports on the developments at al-Dali' were contradictory Friday, with each camp claiming control of the area. The spokesman said southern forces also suffered heavy losses at Abyan where large amounts of weapons and ammunition, including 18 tanks and four armored vehicles, were seized. [passage omitted] Arab League delegates carrying a message from the organization's Secretary General 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid calling for an immediate halt to the civil war were due to meet with President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih on Saturday. Friday's peace plan, proposed by the southern Yemen Socialist Party (YSP), called for an immediate end to the nine-day war and the creation of a national unity government. But northern leaders repeated demands made at the beginning of the conflict for southern leaders to surrender.
