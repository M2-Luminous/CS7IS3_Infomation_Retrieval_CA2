Moreover, a number of signs point to the fact that the leadership of Yugoslavia and the Bosnian Serbs did not consider as serious the NATO threat to inflict strikes on the Serbian artillery positions near Sarajevo and was originally convinced of the political settlement of this conflict. To all the appeals of a number of opposition parties to convene an extraordinary session of the Serbian parliament to discuss the impending threat, the leader of the parliamentary faction of the ruling Socialist Party answered with a refusal, alluding to the great effectiveness of secret diplomatic efforts and the needlessness of additional dramatization of the situation. The military-political leadership of the Serbian side did not believe in the effectiveness of NATO air strikes and calmly waited for the outcome of the situation. To conduct a large air operation in Bosnia in February would be extremely difficult because of the weather conditions. Constant fog, low clouds, and strong winds sharply decrease the possibility of precise bomb-release, not to speak of the threat of large weather-related air plane losses alone. Incidentally, during the period of the ultimatumm, two NATO planes were involved in a catastrophe over the Adriatic Sea (the last smashed in Slovenia, miraculously not having caused a calamity in connection with the possible explosion of ammunition and fuel on board). Combat flights over Sarajevo with the bombing and launching of missiles aimed at Serbian batteries located at times in residential quarters, next to places where contingents of the UN forces are stationed, next to Muslim districts, could already during the first days lead to hundreds of victims among the civilian population and even the "blue helmets." It is not difficult to imagine what an echo this would produce in the Western countries. Moreover, the "first demonstrative strikes" would practically decide anything as regards the demolition of the fire power of Serbian artillery, having several reserve positions each. During the early stage of the ultimatum the commanders of the Bosnian Serbs openly talked about this. The neutralization of the 500 (and possibly even more) firing positions of the Serbs would require massive carpet bombing for a period of 2 weeks, moreover from various directions. The refusal of Greece to make available its military bases for the NATO operation at once sharply decreased the chances for quick success. The potential of the military airports in Italy, as well as the aircraft carrier Saratoga, was clearly inadequate. If we add to this the enormous probability of unwanted hits of civilian objects, the potential possibility of the capture of French and British "blue helmets" by the Serbs, the discontinuation of humanitarian convoys, saving the Muslim population from hunger and its army--from demoralization, reciprocal actions of the Serbian side, both against NATO aircraft and the Muslims, and possible terrorist acts of Serbian extremists in NATO countries, it becomes clear that the Brussels ultimatum was sooner adventurist than a well-considered course of military experts. It is no accident that the German minister of foreign affairs, K. Kinkel, a number of times talked about the fact that the West has a clear concept only about the first step, but not about the second and third one. On the other hand, it was disadvantageous for Belgrade to subject the NATO bloc to possible humiliation, compelling it to proceed to an escalation of the conflict, to aggravate the animosity of the West to the Serbian side, and thereby to let slip out of its hands a realistic prospect for the abolition of the sanctions. Figuratively speaking, Belgrade was not interested in defeating the West above the Sarajevo hills and was worried only about having its position understood in the Western capitals. The Bosnian Serbs, who had no objection to playing with fire, had a different sentiment. It was at this moment that the Russian initiative appeared, which became the life preserver for both NATO and the Serbian side. NATO clearly feels that, having threatened the Serbs, it can only smash its fist, but Belgrade and the capital of the Bosnian Serbs, Pale, are ripening for the next compromise, which does not promise them military advantages, but gives them considerable political dividends. And the main thing--a good reason for retreat presented itself. Also remarkable is the fact that even Western propaganda on the threshold of the hysteria of the NATO ultimatum held back. The first program of French television provided information about a sensational secret report of UN experts to the effect that the mortar shell on the Sarajevo market (because of which the Bosnian NATO ultimatum occurred) was launched from Muslim positions. This report of French Television made the rounds of the tapes of all leading news agencies and the pages of Western newspapers. Although at the time, when earlier TANJUG [Yugoslav News Agency] reported about such a secret meeting of UN experts, no one demonstratively called any attention to this. In short, the ground for an "honorable retreat" was being prepared on the part of NATO. What next? In the opinion of experts, the military situation in Sarajevo has not changed in a major way since the guns that have been withdrawn can be returned in a few hours to the previous positions. It will be more difficult to take the arms collected in eight areas in the city limits out of reserve storage since they are being guarded by the "blue helmets." However, here, too, the principle of a "double key" is observed, and in the case of acute necessity both the Serbs and the Muslims may again use them. But, it would appear, that neither the one, nor the other side for the time being is seeking conflicts with the UN contingents and is inclined to observe the armistice. Now, apparently, a great deal will be decided by the choice of priorities made by the great powers involved in the Bosnian crisis.
