In this connection, he made the following special statement for Bulgarian National Radio and Television: [Zhelev] I signed the Privatization Act because it is one of the most important, not to say fateful, laws for our country's development. Before deciding to sign the law, I held a broad series of meetings and talks with experts and economists from various institutions and circles with the aim of hearing their views. As a result of the talks and the views that I was able to hear, I understood that they have various objections to the content of the law itself, although as a whole most of them support mass privatization. I also have such objections, I also have my own reservations regarding this law, but despite this I decided to let it pass, to sign it, because otherwise there is a danger of us stopping altogether one of the most important aspects of the reforms. Whereas the Restitution of Property Act affected about 3 or 4 percent of the population, and the Law on Return of Farmland affected about 70 percent of the nation, this law affects practically every single one of us. In my view, the mass privatization act, as it is popularly called, is important because of the following. First, it launches, it provides a powerful stimulus -- if it is properly applied -- to privatization in general, which in Bulgaria is almost at a standstill. Second, it creates a new, far wider social basis. Such an important law cannot operate effectively unless it is supported by practically the entire nation. For this to happen, one needs mass privatization that attracts the interest of the people. Third, none of the Eastern European countries that are moving along the same path were able to manage without the instrument of mass privatization. In Czechia, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, and Russia, although the different countries achieved varying rates of success, all of them in one way or another used mass privatization as a means to intensify this process and impart a strong impulse to it. In practice, I found myself in the situation, despite my reservations, of having to sign this law. However, for it to be a truly effective law, to prevent it proving another dead letter, in my opinion parliament must pass as a matter of urgency the bills on insolvencies and on investment funds, and also carefully consider the question whether the banks could not also be used in the role of investment funds. Second, in the subsidiary legislative and normative documents to the act, it is essential to differentiate very clearly and precisely the functions and role of the mass privatization center and the Privatization Agency, to ensure that the mass privatization in no way hampers the other forms of market privatization. Last, but not least, we need a strong government that has the will, energy, and courage to carry out the privatization. The law itself, however perfect it may be, cannot achieve anything. Accordingly, I had to choose between signing a not completely perfect law on mass privatization and the prospect of Bulgaria not having any mass privatization at all. I prefered to sign.
