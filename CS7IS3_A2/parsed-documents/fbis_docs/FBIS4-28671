The lingering concern stems in part from low levels of prices for their products. But some businesses are not worried by the recession. "I don't feel any slump in consumption," said an official of a Tokyo discount store near JR Kanda Station. The area is widely known as the hub of discounters, where foreign-made golf gear sell for 30,000 yen per set against suggested retail prices of around 100,000 yen. Air conditioners are priced at 80,000 yen against the makers' suggested 210,000 yen. Those who buy goods there, by and large, are amazed by the low prices. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata last month proposed that the government should double real national incomes by lowering prices of goods. The proposal, made at an unofficial meeting of cabinet ministers on May 24, touched off a barrage of criticisms from the business community, however. This is largely because business leaders fear that such a policy, if implemented, would result in the collapse of prices, thereby squeezing corporate sales and eventually contracting the Japanese economy as a whole. Said Yoshihiko Miyauchi, president of Orix Corp., Japan's largest leasing firm, "a fall in prices translates into a slowdown in business activity." The Japanese economy faces a danger of falling into "a deflationary spiral," he warned. Many other corporate executives agree. The view is gaining ground among businesses that they need to blunt the rippling effects of lower prices. Japanese consumers are becoming more price-conscious and seeking lower-priced goods, prompted in part by the yen's steep appreciation which make imports less expensive. By contrast, corporate executives are increasingly concerned over the risk of deflation. Hajime Sakamoto, a director of Mitsui Petrochemical Industries Ltd., observed that consumer preference for lower-priced goods makes it hard to feel an economic comeback although the economy may have hit bottom in quantitative terms. Kagehide Kaku, head of the Bank of Japan's Research and Statistics Department, forecast prices will remain at low levels for a while, although an economic recovery usually gives rise to the possibility of inflation. The market mechanism is now in motion toward a narrowing of price gaps between Japan and abroad, accelerating the downward pace of domestic prices that are already lower than before due to the protracted recession. Mitsuo Ohashi, managing director of comprehensive chemical maker Showa Denko K. K., said, "it's only natural that the internationalization of the Japanese economy should lead to higher imports." "But, domestic prices will continue a downward spiral unless the yen's ascent is halted, and a strong economic recovery is not expected," he added.
