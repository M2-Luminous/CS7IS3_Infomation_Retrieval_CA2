A Failing Sector"] [Text] Bela Kadar, minister of international economic relations, could not have rated Hungary's foreign trade sector a "success" even if he had been wearing his rosiest spectacles at his briefing last week. He was forced to announce that, after two years of continuous increases, Hungarian exports plunged into a nosedive in 1993. Experts had already been predicting that change. To a large extent the minister attributed it to the fact that Hungarian economic policy has not been sufficiently "international economy-friendly." However, a retrospective analysis covering the preceding years shows that the policy itself has not been sufficiently "economy-friendly." The value of Hungary's exports last year was $8.9 billion. In comparison with 1992, that was 16.8-percent lower in terms of foreign exchange, and nearly 10 percent lower in terms of volume. At the same time the value of imports rose considerably, by about 13 percent overall, to a total of $12.5 billion. Thus the balance of trade based on statistics compiled by the Customs Service (it includes all goods entering and leaving Hungary) showed a deficit of $3.6 billion for 1993. Even after deducting the items not involved in commercial transactions, this burdened the balance of trade by about $2.3 billion. Last year, then, the contradiction that had existed during the preceding three years between the domestic economy's rapidly deteriorating performance on the one hand and foreign trade's improving performance on the other was resolved. Between 1990 and 1992, the shrinking economy produced increasing dollar earnings, despite the forced switching of markets and the collapse of trade with East Europe. Special domestic and external conditions stimulated and made possible the growth of exports during this period. The narrowing of the domestic and Eastern markets led to increased sales to developed countries; the boom in the West, together with the related partial opening of Western markets and the economic-diplomacy moves (from the beginning of 1990 the EC granted Hungary import preferences under the Generalized System of Preferences, then Hungary concluded a Europe Agreement with the EC and subsequently an association agreement with the EFTA [European Free Trade Association]), made those increased sales to developed countries possible. Ownership posed hardly any obstacle to unprofitable exports and the squandering of assets. Parallel with switching markets, however, there was no move toward a more efficient and more competitive export structure. To the contrary, the structure of Hungarian exports took a definite turn for the worse in 1991 and 1992. First, the two commodity division (sources of energy, and materials and components), for the production of which conditions in Hungary are certainly not more favorable than elsewhere due to the paucity of natural resources and the capital intensity of production, and whose rising transportation costs to greater distances set rigorous constraints on the expansion of supply, maintained their stable share of exports at about 40 percent. Furthermore, the proportion of customs processing within Hungarian exports rose sharply in those years in comparison with 1990. A whole range of domestic economic players--particularly in light industry, but also at many engineering and chemical enterprises as well--had undertaken the custom processing of other countries' materials, primarily for German firms, to load their own unused capacities and to provide work for their employees. (In 1992, the proportion of custom processing in the textile and clothing industry was 90 percent of its total exports.) However, this activity is not very economical; it does not make investment possible and therefore provides no opportunity for advancing beyond custom processing. The market for custom processing strongly depends on the international business cycle and is characterized by ever stiffer price and cost competition among the countries of East Europe. Therefore the increase in exports based on custom processing lacked a solid foundation and stemmed mostly from necessity. Usually the proportion of machinery exports is regarded as a measure of an economy's competitiveness. The proportion of machinery within Hungary's exports dropped significantly after 1990; with the sharp contraction of export opportunities to Eastern markets, Hungary's engineering industry had only moderate success in marketing its low-technical products in developed countries. Agriculture and the food industry jointly account for about a quarter of Hungary's exports. In spite of the changes underway, however, large volumes of standardized products, often merely of inferior quality, (bread grains, meat products of a low order of processing, and wines in bulk, for instance) remained typical also in the 1990's. But this export structure is too capital-intensive for production conditions in Hungary. Like custom processing, it is very sensitive to the business cycle, and its economic efficiency is low. The roots to the decline of exports since the end of 1992 and the beginning of 1993 lie in the absence of structural change. Uneconomical production and sales manifested themselves in liquidity crises among businesses, resulting in mass bankruptcies because of the strict regulations. The tightening of monetary policy as of 1992, the abolition of prefinancing for exports, the shortcomings in the system of export guaranties, and recession in the West further aggravated the economic players' impossible situation. Cutbacks, one of the tendencies necessary for structural change, accelerated from the second half of 1992. (In 1992, for instance, farm output fell by 22 or 23 percent, and the food industry's output by 13 percent.) A significant proportion of the large exporters underwent transformation; a part--and in some instances all--of their stocks of exportable commodities disappeared. Presumably the economic players' exports will not cease entirely after the bankruptcy proceedings and liquidations, and only the uneconomical exports will drop out. Consequently, the decline of exports in 1993 was a normal development. The main question today is what was actually at the bottom of last year's processes, of the significant decline in exports and the growth in imports. Was the worsening of the balance of trade a natural symptom of the commencement of economic growth, of the intensification of investment activity, and hence of structural change? Or was it a sign of the Hungarian economy's continuing slump? Last year the export of energy sources showed the highest rate of rise, nearly 30 percent (based on figures for the first 10 months). Materials, sources of energy, and electricity together accounted for nearly 42 percent of Hungary's total exports in 1993. In relation to a very low basis of comparison, even machinery exports showed an increase of about 10 percent overall. However, that average conceals a drop of about 15 percent in shipments to developed countries, and the near doubling of machinery purchases by the former socialist countries. (Though not evident from the statistics, it may be assumed that the reexportation of aircraft brought in from Lithuania for repairs played a substantial role in the latter's increase. In the classical sense, however, such repairs cannot be regarded as Hungarian machinery exports.) Significant structural changes can already be perceived behind the engineering industry's shrinking export sales: the exports of products that once were traditional export items (buses, farm machinery, and machine tools) are declining, while the exports of several new commodity groups (cars and their subassemblies, for instance) are rising. Three commodity groups--custom processing, bread grains, and food-industry products--played the decisive role in export's sharp decline last year. They jointly accounted for 77 percent of the overall decline. The drastic, more than 50-percent, drop in the export of custom processing is not surprising on the basis of what has been said above, but it is the more surprising in the light of available statistics. To wit, the value of materials brought into Hungary for customs processing last year was the same as in 1992. Consequently, on that basis and even with allowances for slippages in meeting shipping schedules, also the value of custom processing exported in 1993 should have developed roughly on the same level as in 1992. As an incentive to undertake customs processing, the requirement to pay duty on consumption entries with drawback privileges was abolished as of 1 January 1993, in response to strong pressure from the Ministry of International Economic Relations. By now it is already evident that this change in the regulations is being widely abused: Materials brought in duty-free for custom processing simply "vanish" into domestic consumption. The deep crisis in agriculture and the food industry played the decisive role in the decline of these exports. This is clearly evident from the fact that last year, just as in 1992, the internal confusion and shortages of stocks of exportable commodities in agriculture and the food industry prevented domestic producers from taking full advantage even of the export opportunities provided by our Europe agreement. Overall, the structure of exports did not change significantly in 1993 as compared with its previous structure. For the time being, the minor changes are mostly indications of cutbacks. In principle, however, the sharp rise in imports--consisting predominantly of machinery imports--could be perceived as an indication of the commencement of "recovery." But closer examination reveals that last year's import surplus in machinery was mostly a one-time occurrence, and that its purpose was not the modernization of production. To wit, machinery imports included about $100 million worth of repairs of Lithuanian aircraft (this item in itself represents an increase of about $40 million over 1992), deliveries of Russian combat materiel to offset earlier Hungarian claims, and the two Boeings purchased by MALEV [Hungarian Airlines]. Increasing purchases of internal combustion engines further augmented machinery imports. The causes of these increasing purchases were three-fold. Environmental-friendly DAF [Van Doorn Automobile Factory] engines for the buses being built for the BKV [Budapest Transportation Enterprise] accounted for the bulk of the increased purchases. Furthermore, export orders for buses increasingly specify foreign-made engines in them. Finally, the development of production at the Suzuki factory is also increasing the import of internal combustion engines. Only an extremely small part of machinery imports--slight increases in imports of food-industry, farm, and lumber-industry machinery and of communications equipment--can be linked at all to investment activity. Energy and material imports more closely associated with economic growth continued to abate in 1993. The significant rise in imports of petroleum products can be attributed to scheming in conjunction with the supply of household fuel oil rather than to a "kick-start" of the economy. From the development of imports in 1993, in other words, it is not yet possible to infer economic growth. According to the briefing provided by the minister of international economic relations, the earlier unfavorable processes slowed down during the fourth quarter of last year. But the casual observer is perplexed when attempting to identify the cause of this improvement. Was it due to the customary "year-end rush," to expectations of a devaluation, or to the suitable grouping of the data over time? However, one thing is certain: The improvement definitely was not due to the export-incentive package plan the government adopted last September. That decision did not mean measures that took effect and made themselves felt immediately. It is safe to say that nothing of that plan was implemented by 31 December 1993, with the exception of the forint's slight devaluation which, incidentally, was not even included in the package plan's proposal. To this day the prefinancing of exports remains unsolved, an Eximbank has not been established, and the rate of corporate income tax will be reduced only as of the beginning of 1994. The indicators for 1993 still reflect economic hedge-hopping. It is indisputable that the commencement of economic growth can be expected only from a rise in profitable export, and that in its turn is closely related to the general state of the economy. Today the stimulation of exports cannot be imagined solely on the basis of economic-diplomacy or trade-policy measures, for it is obvious that neither agriculture and the food industry nor the custom processors have been able to take full advantage of the opportunities that the Europe agreement provided. On the other hand, it would be essential to conduct several investigations for a feasibility study of a larger-scale (real) devaluation of the forint that numerous economic players and experts have frequently been demanding. We ought to know, for instance, whether the forint is truly undervalued or happens to be overvalued. How elastic is the response of exports and imports to a forint devaluation. How large is the imports content of exports. And how does devaluation affect the price- and cost-competitiveness of exports, and domestic inflation. In other words, does forint devaluation do more good than harm. In the case of a devaluation for the purpose of stimulating export, we should take into consideration also the fact that this tool helps only those who already are exporting, but it hardly helps new players to enter the market. The frequently voiced argument that a larger devaluation would enhance the price-competitiveness of custom processing raises the question as to whether Hungary could afford to enter into cutthroat competition with its neighbors for custom processing, to regain its markets on this basis, and then to continue an export that has no future. Because of the deep structural causes underlying the decline of exports, it is very unlikely that even a significant change in the exchange rate could substantially boost the export volume. A growth in exports can be expected only from an improvement in the general state of the economy--in other words, only in the long run. That improvement can be brought about only by an economic policy that, within the framework of budgetary reform, reduces the burden of taxes and social-insurance contributions, and thereby increases the resources available for investment, improves enterprises' efficiency, accelerates privatization, aids the entry of new exporters into the market, and creates order in the agricultural economy. It would be illusory to expect rapid improvement within a short time.
