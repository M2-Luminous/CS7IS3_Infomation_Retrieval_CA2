The Foreign Affairs Committee issued a statement saying, "Cuba has never been adverse to the possibility of reaching an understanding with the emigrant population," and Cuba has talked with sectors that disagree with the island's political project but have no ties with the CIA and do not favor the blockade or aggression. The document, which was revealed at a Latin American and Caribbean solidarity meeting recently held here, specifically rejects the so-called "Democratic Platform" position, that, abroad, pretends to favor dialogue. Cuban legislators have said this group has "no backing among the emigrants and represents one of the strategy trends that certain stubborn power circles in the United States have for Cuban counterrevolutionary groups." The document notes that in its search for legitimacy, this group, which lacks political backing, claims it represents Cuban liberal trends, the Christian democracy, and the social democracy. Expanding on this issue, the document points out that the Liberal Unity and the so-called Social Democratic Coordinating Board, members of the platform, have no more than 30 members combined and even less support in Cuba. The document cautions that the platform's political position does not condemn "the criminal U.S. blockade against Cuba," but rather denies it, minimizing the extent of the conflict to "bickering among Cubans" in an effort to confuse and weaken international solidarity. The document accuses the platform of not criticizing, at all, the aggressive U.S. policy against Cuba and of defending and praising the most important terrorist programs of the Cuban-American National Foundation, with its headquarters in Miami, Florida, the United States. According to the parliament, the so-called Democratic Platform has received political and economic support from foundations and governments, and from the U.S. administration itself through the National Endowment for Democracy and the CIA to carry out its plans. The 25-page document provided some biographical data on the main leaders of the pseudocoalition, including Jose Ignacio Rasco, one of the CIA's chosen, it said, to create the "Cuban Revolutionary Council" which served as a civilian front for the U.S. Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961. Regarding Enrique "Kike" Balyora, it said he belonged to several terrorist organizations in the service of the CIA, took specialized training courses at Fort Benning for elite, covert operations, and worked as an analyst for the Pentagon in such sensitive issues as El Salvador. Carlos Alberto Montaner also belonged to a terrorist organization, and different sources have placed him on the CIA's payroll since the 1960's as a propaganda agent and specialist in ideological subversion. It added that Montaner served two years in the U.S. Army, received training in covert operations, and recently has become the main organizer of campaigns in Washington against the Cuban Revolution. "His syndicated press columns are marked by his pejorative attitude toward Latin America and the glorification of U.S. values as patterns to be imitated in the subcontinent," the document added. Regarding Juan Alberto Suarez-Rivas, it noted he was also involved in different counterrevolutionary organizations, the same as Angel Del Cerro, whereas Emilio Martinez Venegas was recruited by the CIA in the 1960's and he now lives in Venezuela. The list includes Pedro Alejandro Interian Garcia, a leader of terrorist organizations in and out of Cuba in the 1960's. According to the document, after trying rapprochement and feigning a respectful attitude on a political level, in 1991, he reestablished and activated his ties with CIA agents and collaborators and represented their platform in Brazil. "These men are incapable of playing a positive role in any real process of improving relations between Cuba and the United States, nor do they have the moral, political, and ethical legitimacy in Cuba's commitment to improving relations with regard to emigration," the parliament statement concludes.
