FBIS3-49927 "dreeu009__a94024" FBIS-EEU-94-009-A Document Type:Daily Report 13 January 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria Foreign Ministry Backs Full NATO Membership AU1201092794 Sofia BTA in English 2208 GMT 11 Jan 94 AU1201092794 Sofia BTA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Sofia, January 11 (BTA) -- Parliament's December declaration stating Bulgaria's readiness to join NATO is a parliamentary act which sends a positive signal of this country's new foreign policy, reads a letter from Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev to National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov, received at BTA this afternoon. The president stresses the importance of the unanimous approval of the declaration as a sign of a mature stand on vital national security problems in the post-communist era and of the political course toward integration into Europe. Parliament passed the declaration on December 21, just before its Christmas recess. In connection with the NATO summit on January 10-11 and the alliance's decisions on its relations with partner countries, the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry today said that the strategic objective of Bulgaria's new policy is to provide external guarantees for national security and integrate into European and Euro-Atlantic structures. There is broad public support and a consensus among the parliamentary forces on a future full membership in NATO and the Western European Union, reflected in the National Assembly declaration. The ministry was pleased to note the willingness to open toward the security issues facing Eastern Europe and admit new members in the future manifested at the summit. We hope this process will be based on equality, taking into account the lawful security interests of partner states and providing and defining security guarantees in the future, says the declaration. The ministry described the Partnership for Peace Initiative as a radically new step in the relations between NATO and partner states. It gives an equal start to all countries, seeking closer ties and integration into the alliance's structures, preventing a feeling of isolation, the declaration says. We see the implementation of the initiative as a process and as the first stage along the road to a full NATO membership for partner states on an equality basis. An essential element of the implementation of partnership for peace is the promotion of political cooperation, which will ensure equal participation for the partners in the respective NATO bodies and pave their way to sharing in political decision-making within the alliance. We believe that consultations with NATO in case of a direct security threat to any Central or East European country is one of the most farsighted and useful forms of political cooperation within the partnership for peace initiative, the declaration goes on to say. Bulgaria strongly favours a further promotion of its practical cooperation with the North Atlantic Alliance and its member states and with the partner states of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, it says. "A membership in NATO is the only guarantee for this country's national security," said Asparukh Panov MP of the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), upon his return from a meeting of the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly yesterday [10 January]. According to SDS's supreme leadership, the cabinet failed to make use of the parliament's December 21 declaration, by stating more firmly this country's desire to become a NATO member and by publicizing the parliamentary decision via diplomatic channels. "NATO gave the green light for a future admission of East European countries to its structures through the Partnership for Peace Plan. The strange thing is that none of the alliance's documents names Bulgaria," Asparukh Panov told journalists today. "I expected nothing more. We have to be realists," Dimitur Yonchev MP of the Bulgarian Socialist Party told national television's Repercussions Show this evening. He supports Bulgaria's balanced declaration on the issue. The Partnership for Peace Initiative contains too many if's for a language like English, said Yonchev. He shares the view the plan was designed to gain time. "No one is ahead of us and the initiative offers enormous opportunities to Bulgaria," said Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov in televised interview.
