FBIS4-10275 "drlat069_r_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-069 Daily Report 29 Mar 1994 Peru Fujimori on Salaries, OAS Secretary, Trade Fujimori on Salaries, OAS Secretary, Trade PY0904000094 Lima LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 29 Mar 94 p 2 PY0904000094 Lima LA REPUBLICA Spanish BFN [Text] President Alberto Fujimori announced yesterday a salary increase of 40 percent for teachers and health personnel with professional degrees, and a 30 to 33 percent increase for those without degrees. He also announced that the minimum salary for the private sector will go from 72 to 132 new soles as of 1 April, and that for public servants the minimum salary will be 300 new soles. According to the presidential announcement, the salary increase will represent an additional spending in the budget of 180 million new soles. President Fujimori indicated that the increase represents a partial recovery of the purchasing power of state workers. He added that a decision was also made to increase the salaries of the National Police and the Armed Forces, but he did not specify by how much. The salary issue was one of the more difficult demands to be met by the government. In all the polls done a high percentage demanded an urgent salary increase. When the sale of some public companies such as the Peruvian Telephone Company was done for more than $2 billion, many sectors believed the government was in the condition to increase salaries substantially. The president, however, denied this several times, saying that the country cannot go back to populist measures. The president said: "Under no circumstances will the income from privatizations be used in administrative spending such as salary increases." On the contrary, he said, about $1.6 billion will be used on what he called "social spending," which was later defined as "investment in productive employment." The president also said that the money received from privatizations will not be used to pay the foreign debt, and therefore it is not clear where the money to pay the announced salary increase will come from. Regarding the "minimum salary" of 300 new soles for public servants, some leaders expressed their doubts because "for the first time the salaries of public servants will be above the private sector." Despite the fact that the president said many times that it was not necessary to increase the minimum salary "because we are in an open market ruled by the law of supply and demand," this salary was increased yesterday from 72 to 132 new soles. President Alberto Fujimori also referred to the recent election of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria as new OAS secretary general. Fujimori said Gaviria would give greater dynamism and a new focus to this continental organization, "which for years has been involved more in international political discussions." He added that an emphasis on regional integration in the fields of economic and commercial development and the struggle against drug trafficking are points that will receive special treatment by the new OAS secretary general, with whom Fujimori shares these concerns. Fujimori then referred to the working tour to be made by Efrain Goldenberg, president of the Council of Ministers and foreign minister, and Energy and Mines Minister Daniel Hokama throughout Asia to promote the investment possibilities offered by Peru. Fujimori is confident that as a result of the meetings to be held by the ministers with Asian businessmen and investors, they will respond with the same enthusiasm found in the Americas and Europe to invest in the country. President Fujimori made these comments after dedicating five educational centers built by the National Institute of Education and Health Infrastructure (Infes) with an investment of $1,425,630 from the Public Treasury.
