FR940930-0-00122 FR940930-0-00025 Tetramolopium capillare was first collected in 1819 on Maui by Charles Gaudichaud-Beaupre. He named this sterile specimen Senecio capillaris , choosing the specific epithet to refer to its very narrow involute leaves (with margins rolled under along the edges) (Gaudichaud-Beaupre 1830). Based on a fertile specimen collected on Maui in the 1830s, Sherff (1935) described and named Tetramolopium bennettii. After examining and comparing type specimens, St. John (1965) determined that Gaudichaud-Beaupre's Senecio capillaris and Sherff's Tetramolopium bennettii were actually the same species and that Sherff had placed the taxon in the correct genus; St. John (1965) subsequently made the new combination Tetramolopium capillare. Later, St. John (1974) described a new genus, Luteidiscus , for species of Tetramolopium with yellow disk florets, and formed the combination Luteidiscus capillaris. In the current treatment of the genus, Lowrey (1981, 1986, 1990) does not recognize St. John's division of the genus. Tetramolopium capillare is a sprawling shrub with stems measuring 50 to 80 centimeters (cm) (20 to 31 inches (in)) long and covered with many glands when young. The very firm, stalkless leaves are involute and are usually 13 to 25 millimeters (mm) (0.5 to 1 in) long and 0.4 mm (about 0.01 in) wide. Flower heads are situated singly at the ends of stalks 1 to 3.5 cm (0.4 to 1.4 in) long. Located beneath each flower head are 45 to 50 bracts, arranged in a structure 3 to 4 mm (about 0.1 in) high and 7 to 10 mm (0.3 to 0.4 in) in diameter. In each flower head, 30 to 50 white, male ray florets, 3.5 to 4 mm (about 0.1 in) long and 0.6 to 8 mm (0.02 to 0.3 in) wide, surround 15 to 25 greenish yellow tinged with red, functionally female florets about 3.6 mm (0.1 in) long. The achenes (dry, one-seeded fruits) measure 2 to 2.6 mm (0.08 to 0.1 in) long and 0.7 to 0.8 mm (0.03 in) wide and are topped by a white pappus comprising a single series of bristles 1.9 to 2.1 mm (0.07 to 0.08 in) long. Tetramolopium capillare differs from other species of the genus by its very firm leaves with edges rolled under, its solitary flower heads, the color of its disk florets, and its shorter pappus. It differs from Tetramolopium remyi , with which it sometimes grows, by its more sprawling habit and the shorter stalks of its smaller flower heads (Lowrey 1990). Historically, Tetramolopium capillare is known from Lahainaluna to Wailuku on West Maui (Lowrey 1981). This species is known to be extant near Halepohaku on State land (Hawaii Plant Conservation Center (HPCC) 1992a, 1992b). The two known populations, which are separated by 2.4 kilometers (km) (1.8 miles (mi)), contain a total of 12 known plants (Steve Perlman, HPCC, pers. comms., 1992). Tetramolopium capillare typically grows on rock substrates at elevations between 615 and 900 meters (m) (2,020 to 3,000 feet (ft)) in Lowland Dry Mixed Shrub and Grassland and in Montane Dry Shrubland. Plant species associated with the higher elevation population include Dodonaea viscosa ('a'ali'i), Metrosideros polymorpha ('ohi'a), and Styphelia tameiameiae (pukiawe). 'A'ali'i, Heteropogon contortus (pili grass), and Myoporum sandwicense (naio) are associates of the other population. The major threats to Tetramolopium capillare are fire; competition from alien plant species, particularly Lantana camara (lantana), Leucaena leucocephala (koa haole), and Rynchelytrum repens (Natal redtop); and reduced reproductive vigor and/or extinction from stochastic events due to the small number of existing populations and individuals (HPCC 1992a, 1992b).
