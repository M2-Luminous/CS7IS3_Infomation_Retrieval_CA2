She is one of the women who have called for the establishment of a Japan-ROK-DPRK women's organization called "Peace in Asia and the Role of Women" which holds seminars to discuss such issues as the resolution of the conflict between the ROK and the DPRK and Japan's postwar settlements. When she attended a seminar held in Pyongyang in 1992, she received a direct invitation from DPRK President Kim Il-song to visit North Korea together with her family. She said she accepted the invitation, in the hope that it might "help contribute to the promotion of Japan-DPRK exchanges." In connection with the DPRK nuclear issue, there is a rush of visits to the DPRK by Japanese politicians. For example, the Social Democratic Party of Japan has already sent a delegation, and House of Representatives members Taku Yamazaki and Yoichi Tani of the Liberal Democratic Party are scheduled to visit on 14 June. Amid the flurry of political visits, Mrs. Miki said: "I have been making preparations since late last year. There are no plans for me to meet government officials (in connection with the nuclear issue). It is purely a family trip."
