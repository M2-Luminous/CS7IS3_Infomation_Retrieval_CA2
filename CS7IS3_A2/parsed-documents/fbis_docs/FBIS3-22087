The chief suspect was arrested in his prison cell in Vridsloselille. From his cell in the state penitentiary in Vridsloselille, a sentenced Colombian cocaine smuggler was controlling a drug ring. This was learned from statements made by couriers who have been apprehended and are currently in custody in Copenhagen and Amsterdam. Narcotics Police Chief Erik Bjorn believed this to be the most extensive cocaine operation ever uncovered in Denmark. Some 45 kilos of South American cocaine was smuggled into Denmark as well as via Denmark into the Netherlands inside bowling balls, EDP equipment, books, and hollow rope. A conservative estimate suggests that a shipment of that size--an enormous quantity in Danish terms--has the value of between 150 and 200 million kroner when sold on the street in small packets to addicts. Nine couriers and middlemen have been arrested in Denmark and the Netherlands in the last month--seven Danes and two Colombians. Thirty-one kilos of cocaine were shipped from Ecuador. An attempt was made to smuggle in only 14 kilos. Some 16 kilos was seized by Copenhagen's narcotics police before it could be distributed. This was accomplished through a series of risky actions undertaken in Ecuador, the Netherlands, and Denmark. The smuggler chase came to a head when the police in Ecuador's capital city, Quito, telephoned Copenhagen police headquarters on Wednesday, 29 December. An airmail package with a Danish address on it had been noted at a post office. It contained two bowling balls that were filled with 6,600 grams of concentrated cocaine. The narcotics police quickly dispatched a vice commissioner to Quito. He accompanied the costly shipment on a plane back to Denmark on 10 January. The police emptied the bowling balls, which had been cast as a shell around the cocaine, and then had the post office send the package on to the recipient in the Netherlands. Apprehended at a Burger Restaurant Next act: Two men from Nakskov, ages 19 and 25, took the train to Amsterdam on 14 January. They brought with them two carrying cases with the now-empty bowling balls. On 18 February they were arrested at a burger restaurant in Amsterdam together with a 23-year-old Colombian whom the police charged with the intention of taking delivery of the cocaine. He is in custody in Amsterdam. The Danes were handed over to Danish authorities and are in custody in Copenhagen. Still another unsuccessful smuggling took place on New Year's Eve. This ended with the arrest of three people in Copenhagen as they were preparing to take delivery of a large shipment from Ecuador via Amsterdam. That package contained five innocent-looking EDP monitors (screen with "internal components") made by a recognized Korean manufacturer. A customs official in Amsterdam became suspicious of the crates during the stopover and found 5,600 grams of cocaine glued between the components of the screens. The whole lot was sent under "controlled transfer"--as the police call it--to the addressee in Copenhagen. Rich on Welfare On 24 January, at the residence of a 48-year-old welfare recipient in Amager--charged with being the primary Danish receiver--the police found 117 grams of cocaine, 160,000 kroner, exchange vouchers for an additional 170,000 kroner, as well as many meters of hollow, braided rope. "This could have been used to smuggle in 8 kilos of cocaine, but we do not know what has become of the drugs," said Criminal Inspector Bjorn. However, the police know from their analyses that cocaine had been packed into the ropes. In addition to the "rope trick," the welfare recipient was also charged with having taken delivery of 6.6 kilos worth of drugs in three instances of smuggling. The acknowledged smuggling incidents were spread over the period between April 1993 and January 1994. Gustavo Rubiano, a Colombian, has been indicated as the head man and organizer. He came to Denmark in February 1992 and that September received a three-year sentence for the smuggling of 731 grams of cocaine and for falsifying documents in a monetary transaction. The testimony in the case reveals that Rubiano directed the operation from prison, among other things in meetings with his two sons. One son is a 20-year-old now sought for drug-related criminal activities and the other is the 23-year-old arrested at the burger restaurant in Amsterdam. The police know that Rubiano hired two Danish couriers who met the Colombian in prison while they were serving sentences for earlier crimes. Narcotics Police Chief's Warning Yesterday the narcotics police fetched Rubiano in Vridslose, interrupted his jail term, and charged him with organizing the smuggling and attempted smuggling of 45 kilos of cocaine--in addition to the drugs for which he has already been sentenced. Finally, there is a young Danish woman serving a four-year sentence in the Netherlands. She was arrested in June 1993 in Amsterdam with 4 kilos of cocaine. Today the police know that she was also hired by the Rubiano gang as a courier. "Often it is very young people who sign on for a trip to the sunny southern shores after delivering a shipment of drugs. I would like to give young people a very strong warning against accepting this offer. They must expect that sooner or later they will be caught," said the narcotics police chief.
