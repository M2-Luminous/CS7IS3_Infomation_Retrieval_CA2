The state-run telephone company also announced the establishment of Korea Telecom Research Laboratories, which comprises the six existing research arms of the company. "The reshuffle of our research efforts was necessary because most research projects call for close coordination between our research centers," said Yi Yong-kyong, who became the first president of KT Research Labs. A spokesman said Korea Telecom will funnel 320 billion won and 684 researchers into 69 R&D projects this year. The research fields will include automatic translation, intelligent network and integrated digital service network (ISDN) technologies. For each project, KT Research Labs will form a research team by recruiting related specialists from the existing research centers. "We hope this process, which is already adopted by advanced foreign research institutions, will greatly enhance our technological competitiveness in the world market," Yi said. The nation's largest telephone company has steadily increased its R&D budget, from 198 billion won in 1992 to 277 billion won, or 4.2 percent of its annual sales, last year. The company will expand its R&D budget up to more than 8 percent of its annual revenues by the year 2000, a spokesman said. Most of the nation's research funds in the telecommunications sector come from the three major operators--Korea Telecom, Korea Mobile Telecom and Dacom. In 1993, the three companies invested a combined 300 billion won in research and technological development. Their combined R&D investment will increase to 400 billion won this year, or an estimated 6.5 percent of this yearly revenues [as published].
