It will also incorporate a rapid deployment unit, which will, "if necessary, defend Croatian interests and the Croatian minority on all territories of the former Yugoslavia." As of now, this is only a proposal by a group of generals and politicians who belong to the rightist, radical fraction of the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community]. Considering the present situation of the Croatian Armed Forces and the HDZ itself, it is quite realistic that these plans will actually be carried out. With rare exceptions, the Croatian Army General Staff and the commanding officers in the brigades consist of members of the ruling party who could, even if the ruling party were to be replaced, carry out the policy of their party unopposed, or even prevent the winning party from taking office. What kind of future does the "Development Plan for the Croatian Armed Forces" foresee? As stated, "the present unstable political-military situation in southeastern Europe will continue in the coming years, maybe for the whole decade." According to all available data, the situation in the parts of the country where the Serbian population is in the majority will not normalize. Serbia will continue to supply these areas with large amounts of weapons, and the threat of terrorist groups must be taken into account. Having a border with a possible Muslim state, which could cut through the territory of the Republic of Croatia, thereby hampering a free flow of people and goods, presents military and security problems. Moreover, the border with the present FRY will be extremely difficult to control. In the future, this border will have to remain a concern of highest priority. Along its most critical points it will have to be reinforced with heavy armored, motorized, and special airborne forces. Acting as a constant destabilizing factor, the so-called FRY will probably continue "to lay claim not only to some parts of the Republic of Croatia but also to the territory of other states formed on the territory of the former Yugoslavia." Given this assessment of the situation, it was only to be expected that the plan would propose "the gradual formation of an army that will be capable not only of protecting its borders if attacked from outside, but also of launching strong counterattacks on enemy's positions on enemy's territory, as well as pre-emptive strikes on enemy bases near the Croatian border. The Croatian Armed Forces must be ready in the future to respond quickly to protect ethnic Croats who live outside of the borders of the Republic of Croatia." According to the planning being done by the Croatian generals, the Croatian Army should focus on acquiring U.S. military hardware or on cooperation with countries that produce weapons and equipment under U.S. license. If all these plans are fulfilled, the U.S. armament industry should prosper. Croatia plans to purchase 210 Phantom aircraft of various models. The first delivery will replace 40 MiG-21 and Jastreb aircraft. The Croatian Air Force plans to replace them in the next two years. The remaining aircraft would be purchased over the next five years. There are also detailed plans regarding helicopters. The Croatian Government has already bought 10 MD-500 helicopters made under U.S. license in South Korea. Argentina manufactures missiles and machine guns for these helicopters. They are highly maneuverable. They can be also equipped with a submarine detector, TOW laser-guided antitank rockets, Martin Pescador air-to-ground missiles (to destroy radar systems), double lasers for Stinger missiles, two torpedos, a GE six-barrel mobile 7.62-mm minigun, a Hydra 70 launcher for 70-mm tracer bullets, and an infrared decoy emitter device. Half of these helicopters are already flying with HVO [Croatian Defense Council] markings. The total should reach approximately 100 in four years, in addition to a larger number of transport helicopters and aircraft. Croatia would also like to buy radar and missile systems, leopard tanks, and long-range artillery made in the United States or under U.S. license. To reduce costs, individual parts would be produced in Croatia -- difficult to accomplish considering the technological capacities of Croatian industry. The Army will receive an appropriation equal to 45 percent of the state budget, or about $1.3 billion. Over the next five years at least, the Army would receive 36.7 percent of the supplemental revenue derived from taxes on all goods and services. Consequently, Croatia would have to take out loans, which will in turn require forming strategic alliances with certain countries. It is against this background that one should interpret Croatian defense minister's proposal that Zemunik airport be turned into a U.S. military base for the operations throughout southeast Europe, that the Rijeka shipyard be made available for repair services for the Sixth Fleet, and that U.S. Navy ships be given permanent docking privileges in any Croatian port they choose. Croatian military strategy would be a complete -- maybe slightly modified -- copy of the Israeli defense system. The toughest problem (although the Croatian authorities will not admit it) will be officer training. So far, Croatia does not have a satisfactory educational system at all. It is a fact that it lacks military secondary schools, let alone a military academy or so-called military colleges, in which the cadets could acquire know-how to advance to the highest military ranks. There is a shortage of senior officers. Moreover, only a few generals would be capable of passing a rigorous exam, with the exception of those that came over from the JNA [Yugoslav People's Army]. However, there are only very few of them and they have been kept inactive for now. Another option would be training abroad, limited to the United States or to countries that buy the weapons from the United States or its licensees. The "unsolved problems with the western neighbor and Italy" are also mentioned, which inevitably leads to the question of whether the Balkans is going to eventually wind up with another unpredictable "Balkan policeman."
