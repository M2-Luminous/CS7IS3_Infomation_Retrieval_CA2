On 26 March, the people and National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] further attacked the invading forces. Some continued to cut the enemies' throats: 1. from Suosdei to Pailin; 2. from Suosdei to Krek; 3. from Phnum Kon Damrei to Sala Krau; and 4. completely cutting off the invading forces' transport lines from Kamping Puoy and Kap Chen and along the Mongkolborei River. Others were split into groups to attack the invading forces in many areas -- they especially attacked the forces moving along the roads, including tanks and ground troops, causing them to sustain constant damage. In sum, the situation on 26 March was that the people and NADK initiated attacks on the invading forces by cutting their throats, smashing their ground forces to pieces, and attacking their tanks one after another, causing them to lose control gradually in the perimeters or traps of Sala Krau and Pailin. II. On 27 and 28 March, the people and NADK continued to attack the invading forces. Some continued to cut off the forces' narrow transport lines, in particular the routes linking Suosdei and Pailin, Suosdei and Treng, and Phnum Kon Damrei and Sala Krau. As for other roads, they were completely cut off, causing the invading forces to lose control. Those in Sala Krau and Pailin were surrounded by the people and NADK from all directions. In this situation, the people and NADK attacked the invading forces in many areas, including those in Pailin, Sala Krau, and along the inner roads. We attacked both the ground troops and tanks. On 27 and 28 March, the salient situation was that the invading forces began to lose control gradually: 1. They could not supply fuel, ammunition, and foodstuffs; 2. An increasing number of them were afflicted with Malaria and typhoid and there was no medicine for treatment; 3. Soldiers, especially new recruits, continued to break ranks in large numbers, making the invading forces extremely short of troops. They were not even able to occupy the tiny town of Pailin, the size of which is one square kilometer. They ordered hundreds of their troops in Pailin and Sala Krau to defend the two areas, but they were not able to because they were constantly attacked by the people and NADK. In sum, on 27 and 28 March, the people and NADK killed 67 invading soldiers and wounded over 70 others. They also destroyed 40 assorted guns and seized 27 others. There was a significant decrease in the activities of cannons -- during these two days only a few rounds were fired. Tanks hardly dared carry out activities; they only protected the invading forces' bases. As for military leaders of the communist Vietnamese puppets and two-headed government, they lamented in their conversations over the difficult situation; the lack of ammunition, food supplies, fuel, and medicine; and about the malaria and diarrhea problem. Some soldiers defied commanders' orders to fight in this or that area, while others said they could no longer stay and asked for a transfer. This is because if the troops, commanders, and tanks remained, they would be smashed to pieces. It is worth pointing out that within the perimeters of Sala Krau and Pailin, the invading forces can only conduct their operations with tanks, which were used as both combat forces and as a means of transport. As for the ground troops, many of them were killed and wounded every day. This situation terrified the tanks because they had no ground support and no other vehicles joined them in carrying out operations. As such, there was a gradual decrease in the tanks' activities, causing the spirit of the communist Vietnamese puppets and two-headed government troops, which rely on tanks, to increasingly tumble. Moreover, the continued rain downpours caused the invading forces to become more terrified because it was extremely difficult for the ground troops to move or to carry supplies from this or that area. This was due to, on the one hand, the slippery and muddy ground and, on the other, mines and attacks constantly mounted by the people and NADK to cut them into several segments. III. On 29 March, the people and NADK initiated an assault on the invading forces. In particular, they: 1. Continued to cut off their supply lines; 2. Attacked Sala Krau from three directions -- the east, north, and west. In the fighting on the afternoon of 29 March, the people and NADK destroyed two tanks and damaged two others, and they killed more than 40 enemy soldiers and wounded over 60 others. On 29 March, it was the beginning of a new battle scene within the perimeters of Sala Krau and Pailin in a situation where the invading forces' throat was completely cut. From now on, it will be fighting inside the perimeters of Sala Krau and Pailin only. It is a battle inside a trap where the invading forces are encircled from all directions and completely cut off. The situation which has developed every day until 29 March has more clearly demonstrated that: 1. The invading forces are unable to occupy Pailin. This is in accordance with the concrete situation and also predictions and assessments made by international observers since the beginning of the attack on Pailin by the invading forces. 2. Cutting the invading forces' throat and the beginning of the battle inside the perimeters of Sala Krau and Pailin, especially on 29 March, show that the time for the people and NADK to force the invading forces out of the Pailin region is nearing rapidly.
