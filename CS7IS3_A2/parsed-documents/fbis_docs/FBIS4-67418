"It seems to be acid rain, and was caused by the fact that in intensely polluted industrial areas, raindrops that fall through the air are filled with noxious substances. There has never been acid rain in Bucharest; this happens only in very polluted towns," Cezar Niculescu from the Environment Protection Agency told us. Ioan Stanescu of the National Meteorological and Hydrological Institute said: "The clouds that crossed Romania during this period created the necessary conditions for this quite rare phenomenon."
