This was the subject of discussion at a seminar entitled ``Transportation of Uranium,'' sponsored by European Union experts and the Uranerz Consortium. The seminar was held at the Voronovo Resort near Moscow and was the second in a series, with the first held at the same site in later June and early July of last year. Western experts, concerned with the state of affairs in Russia, are attempting to demonstrate how they are solving the problems involved in ensuring safe transportation of ionizing sources, to understand what Russian specialists can do in that direction right now and, eventually, to find a way to integrate our country's safety system (which remains to definitively take shape) with the Western system. The corresponding agencies in the West, both national and international, pay particular attention to the development of monitoring measures to prevent incidents during transport and to mitigate their effects. Among those measures are development of design standards both for the means of transportation and the transportation routes. Standards have also been developed for special transport containers which, as is well known, can cause the greatest unpleasantness if they are not built according to the necessary standards. In the West these ``packages'' undergo appropriate testing. For example, drop tests, compression, depth testing, resistance to physical damage, heat resistance and water resistance. Our country's containers currently undergo the same tests, but as of the fourth quarter of this year Russia will have new regulations specifying container standards. Furthermore, Russian experts are of the opinion that current standards should be stricter than those approved by the International Atomic Energy Agency in 1985. However, these issues are more specific than general. The latter type of issue includes things like the creation of a unified system to ensure safe transportation of radioactive materials in Russia and development of procedures to be used in the event of the worst-case scenario: a transportation accident. Even though fortunately thus far neither Russia nor any other place in the world has experienced a single serious incident, the danger is always there. Toward this end Western specialists have drawn up accident plans regulating actions by all organizations at every stage of clean-up efforts. Now Russian specialists have had an opportunity to familiarize themselves with those plans, and one would hope that Russia will soon have such an essential unified ``accident system'' as well. The first step in that direction was taken in Moscow when efforts by almost 30 various agencies working on this issue were combined under the Ministry for Emergency Situations [Ministerstvo po chrezvychaynym situatsiyam (MChS)]. Also participating in discussion of all these issues, together with Russian participants (of which there were 26, plus specialists from Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Kirghizia and Uzbekistan) were specialists from the companies that comprise the Uranerz Consortium. They had only one complaint: the seminar was not attended by any specialists from the MChS, the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy's Main Administration for Emergency Situations or similar agencies. However, according to the sponsors a special seminar for that type of structure will be held in the near future.
