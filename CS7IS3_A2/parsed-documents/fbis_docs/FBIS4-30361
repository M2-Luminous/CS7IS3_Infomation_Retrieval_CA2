The sources said the G-7 nations are likely to hold a meeting of finance ministers' deputies before the summit to coordinate their views on the issue. On the Tokyo market, the U.S. dollar closed at a record postwar closing low of 99.93 yen on Monday after falling to a global low of 99.50 yen at one stage. An economic declaration to be issued at the summit is now expected to call for coordinated intervention by the participating nations to stabilize the volatile foreign exchange market, the sources said. They also said Japan is likely to face intense pressure at the summit to ease its monetary policy and expand its fiscal measures in order to promote an economic recovery. A joint statement issued at a ministerial meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in early June called for continued cooperation among member countries in the foreign exchange market.
