FR940606-1-00024 FR940606-1-00008 1. Test Methods and Procedures a. Cleaning operation. For multi-component cleaning solvents, compliance with the proposed vapor pressure specifications would be determined using E 260&hyph;85 to quantify the amount of each organic compound in the cleaning solvent. The vapor pressure of each organic compound would be determined from the manufacturer's data, standard engineering reference texts, or other equivalent methods. The total composite vapor pressure would then be calculated by summing the partial vapor pressure of each component according to Raoult's Law. For single component cleaning solvents, the EPA is proposing that vapor pressure data supplied by the manufacturer of the cleaning solvent, standard engineering reference texts, or other equivalent methods be used for compliance determinations. Owners or operators seeking to comply with the cleaning solvent approved composition list would have to show compliance using data supplied by the manufacturer of the cleaning solvent. The data must identify all components of the cleaning solvent and demonstrate that one of the approved composition definitions is met. b. Primer and topcoat application operations. As noted earlier, the proposed standards for organic HAP and VOC emissions would require compliance with an equivalent organic HAP content level (pounds of organic HAP per gallon of coating (less water) as applied) and an equivalent VOC content level (pounds of VOC per gallon of coating (less water and exempt solvents) as applied) for primers and for topcoats. Compliance with these organic HAP and VOC content levels may be accomplished by using compliant coatings, averaging between compliant and non-compliant coatings, control devices, or any combination of these methods. In addition, the proposed standards would require the use of certain application techniques for the application of primers and topcoats. Test methods and procedures have been identified for compliance with the organic HAP and VOC content levels. No test methods or procedures have been identified for the application equipment requirements; however, a test method has been identified for the qualification of alternative application methods. Method 24 in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 would be used to determine the VOC content of each primer and topcoat as applied. Alternatively, manufacturer's data may be used to determine the VOC content of these coatings. However, in the event of any inconsistency between manufacturer's data and Method 24 test results, the Method 24 test results will take precedence. The facility may rely on manufacturer's data to determine the organic HAP content level of each coating. The total organic HAP weight fraction and density of each coating as received would be determined using the manufacturer's data. The volume of each primer and topcoat used would be determined using company records. If diluent solvents or other ingredients are added to a primer or topcoat prior to application, then the total organic HAP and VOC weight fractions, density, and volume must be adjusted appropriately to account for such additions. These values would be required for each 24-hour period; however, only changes in formulation would require re-determination of total organic HAP and VOC weight fractions and density. The proposed standards would then require the owner or operator to calculate the volume-weighted average mass of both VOC and organic HAP in coatings emitted per volume of coating (less water and exempt solvents for VOC; less water for HAP) as applied. This calculation would be performed for each 24-hour period. If an owner or operator is seeking to comply by using compliant coatings, the owner or operator would need to determine the organic HAP content (less water as applied) and VOC content (less water and exempt solvents as applied). If no changes in formulation as applied occurred, then a re-calculation of the organic HAP and VOC content levels would not be required. Where compliant coatings are used, the proposed rule would require the determination of the organic HAP content using manufacturer's data and VOC content using Method 24 or manufacturer's data.
