"Mr. Hata contributed to a smooth development of the Russia-Japan relationship," said Nikolay Solovyov, director of the Russian Foreign Ministry's Asia-Pacific Department. Hata is expected to be elected Japan's new prime minister later in the day following the resignation of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's cabinet. Hata visited Russia in March as foreign minister, and assured Russian leaders of Japan's continued support for reforms. Solovyov, a former Russian ambassador to Tokyo, also called for progress in bilateral relations to solve "the issue that is difficult to reach an agreement on," -- an apparent reference to the thorny territorial question. The dispute over a group of Russian-held islands off Hokkaido, which Japan claims are part of its territory, has kept the bilateral relations in a chill since the end of World War II.
