All Czech political representatives have rejected this demand as unacceptable. Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec even declared that complying with such efforts would mean "revising the outcome of World War II, with all of the repercussions arising from it." Of course, the "Benes Decrees," rejected by the Sudeten Germans, in fact represent only part of the several dozen legislative acts that altered the entire legal being of the Czechoslovak establishment, acts that cannot simply be annulled in toto if we do not want to risk legal chaos. The common denominator of these decrees was President Benes, who issued them from 1940 onwards--of course, only after listening to the government in exile and the so-called State Council, which supplemented legislative authority. The Council was abolished after May 1945, and the decrees were issued on the recommendation of the government and the Slovak National Council [SNR]. Following the elections to the Interim National Assembly in October 1945, legal order was guaranteed by normal laws. Today, we bring you select sections of these decrees that concern the actual issue of the evacuation of the Sudeten Germans. Decree Issued by the President of the Republicon 25 October 1945 on Confiscating Enemy Propertyand on National Revival Funds On the recommendation of the government and after agreement with the Slovak National Council, I decree the following: Part I The Confiscation of Enemy Property Article 1.
