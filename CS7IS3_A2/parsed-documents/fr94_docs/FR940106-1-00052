FR940106-1-00052 FR940106-1-00011 California's Gov. Wilson highlighted the seriousness of the problems in the Bay/Delta when he announced his new water policy on April 6, 1992. California has many species with populations in serious decline, and some faced with extinction. Both existing and proposed water projects often have an impact upon protected animal and plant species.␣*␣*␣* * * * * * [A]ny program must begin by recognizing a disturbing truth: The Delta is broken. Gov. Wilson also outlined the kinds of measures necessary to protect the Bay/Delta: ``If we are to be good stewards of our fish and wildlife, we must begin to mitigate these impacts by providing larger streamflows, greater Delta outflow, restoration of spawning gravel and provision of fish screens and temperature control measures.'' In response to Gov. Wilson's proposal, the State Board initiated the D&hyph;1630 process, the ``immediate goal'' of which was ``to halt the decline and increase the protection of public trust resources where reasonable.'' (SWRCB 1992b). However, as explained above, California abandoned the D&hyph;1630 process, and the State Board has yet to develop criteria that adequately protect the Estuarine Habitat designated use. In its disapproval letter of September 3, 1991, EPA formally found that the set of water quality criteria adopted by the State Board in the 1991 Bay/Delta Plan failed to protect the Estuarine Habitat and other designated fish and wildlife uses of the estuary. To be consistent with the Clean Water Act and the accompanying Regulations, the State's [criteria] must be sufficient to protect Estuarine Habitat and other designated fish and wildlife uses. The Estuarine Habitat use, which has been formally approved by the State and EPA as part of the State's water quality standards, was established to provide ``an essential and unique habitat that serves to acclimate anadromous fishes (salmon, striped bass) migrating into fresh or marine conditions. This habitat also provides for the propagation and sustenance of a variety of fish and shellfish, numerous waterfowl and shore birds, and marine mammals. Water Quality Control Plan, San Francisco Bay Basin(2), December 1986, at II&hyph;4. * * * * * * * * * * The record *␣*␣*␣ does not support the conclusion that the State has adopted criteria sufficient to protect the designated uses. Accordingly *␣*␣*␣ I hereby disapprove the current set of [criteria] contained in the State Board's Bay/Delta Plan because they fail to protect the Estuarine Habitat and the other designated fish and wildlife uses of the estuary. Given the State Board's failure to address EPA's concerns either directly or in the D&hyph;1630 process, EPA is proposing to supplement the State's criteria with additional salinity criteria to protect the Estuarine Habitat designated use and related fish and wildlife uses of the estuary described above. EPA is emphasizing the Estuarine Habitat designated use because of its importance to the whole spectrum of fish and wildlife uses in the estuary. This emphasis is consistent with the Interagency Statement of Principles' recommendation that restoration efforts focus on habitat protection. The discussion below describes the scientific basis for salinity criteria and presents EPA's conclusions as to this proposal. b. Developing Salinity Criteria In developing proposed criteria protecting Estuarine Habitat, EPA has considered the complex hydrological and biological nature of the Bay/Delta estuarine system. Habitat conditions in the estuary change from month to month and year to year primarily in response to precipitation upstream, reservoir operations, agricultural patterns and export rates (Nichols et al. 1986). Many important environmental characteristics within the Delta and Bay respond to changes in water availability, storage and use. The environmental characteristics of particular biological importance include flow rates and volumes within river channels and the Bay, salinity and turbidity levels, water temperature, and the degree of stratification of the water column. Correlations among all these variables are high; thus, each is often a good indicator of the other. However, other factors such as wind, tidal stage, and antecedent conditions influence the day to day values of each variable. When EPA disapproved the State's criteria on September 3, 1991, it suggested that the State could develop approvable replacement criteria using a number of alternative methodologies: it could adopt additional salinity and temperature criteria, adopt revised flow criteria, adopt biological criteria, or develop a combination of these or other scientifically-defensible criteria protecting the designated Estuarine Habitat and fish and wildlife uses in the estuary. Upon the State's failure to revise its criteria during the statutory 90 day period (or during the D&hyph;1630 process), EPA began developing a federal proposal for criteria protecting the applicable designated uses. (1) Entrapment Zone . The ``entrapment zone'' was the focus of EPA's initial consideration of water quality criteria due primarily to its perceived importance to the food chain. The entrapment zone, where ocean water flowing landward at depth mixes with freshwater flowing seaward at the surface (Kimmerer 1992), is widely acknowledged to be one of the most important habitats within the estuary. Salinities are usually between 2 and 10 ppt, turbidity and phytoplankton densities are high, and young fish of several species are most abundant in this zone. One of the most important aspects of the entrapment zone is the localized high density of prey. The closest association of predator and prey with the entrapment zone is shown by Delta smelt and its principal food item, the copepod Eurytemora affinis (Moyle et al. 1992). Similarly, young striped bass and their principal food item, the shrimp Neomysis affinis , are found in the greatest abundance in salinities between 2 and 10 ppt. (Heubach 1969, Siegfried et al. 1979, Orsi and Knutson 1979, Knutson and Orsi 1983, Orsi and Mecum 1986, Obrebski, et al. 1992). Many young fish require high food densities in order to obtain sufficient food for growth (Moyle and Cech 1988), and it has been suggested that the density of food in the entrapment zone may affect fish survival and abundance. However, no direct evidence of starvation has been demonstrated for the declining fish populations of the estuary (Bennett et al. 1990, Moyle et al. 1992). The location of the entrapment zone has also been shown to be important for organisms at lower trophic levels (that is, organisms that are lower on the food chain). Phytoplankton densities are higher when the entrapment zone is within the relatively-shallow Suisun Bay than when it is further upstream in deeper channels (Arthur and Ball 1980). Measurements of phytoplankton growth rates show that shallow areas are ten times as productive as channel areas (Cloern et al. 1983).
