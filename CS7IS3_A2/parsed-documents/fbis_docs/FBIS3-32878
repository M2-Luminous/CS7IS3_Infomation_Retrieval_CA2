In an interview with PRENSA LATINA at the end of his official six-day visit to Brazil, which concluded in Rio, Lage said an example of this isolation is the UN General Assembly's approval of resolutions against the U.S. embargo for two consecutive years. He noted that the second time, more countries supported the resolution. The 44-year-old Cuban vice president indicated this is the result of Cuba's refusal to renounce its socialist principals and the admiration this position produces in the world. Regarding Washington's lifting of the embargo against Vietnam, Lage said this is the result of "the heroic Vietnamese struggle and victory," and makes it even more evident to international public opinion that "the U.S. blockade against Cuba is unjust and cruel." In Brazil, the Cuban leader and the delegation accompanying him visited Sao Paulo, Brasilia -- the capital of the country -- and Rio de Janeiro. They met with President Itamar Franco, Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, and Health Minister Henrique Santillo. Shortly before ending his visit, Lage said he found, in the aforementioned officials, a great understanding and a firm attitude against unilateral measures, like the blockade against Cuba and the so-called Torricelli Law, which seeks to influence third countries with the objective of attacking Cuba. Carlos Lage, one of the Cuban Government's officials in charge of the economy, said the objectives of his official visit to Brazil were to contribute to the development of bilateral political, trade, and economic relations in general, to promote important scientific cooperation agreements in the field of agricultural, and discuss issues of interest to Latin America. Brazil, he underscored, is an exporter of food and industrial products that Cuba needs, but he clarified that he wants trade with the South American giant to be balanced. He indicated that the increasing amount of exports to the Brazilian pharmaceutical market will contribute to that stabilization. A $30 million contract for Cuban sales of those products was signed this year. He emphasized that Cuba owes Brazil $48 million and it is a debt that still needs to be completely paid, but it will be eliminated through the growth of bilateral trade. Regarding the vaccine against type B meningoccic meningitis, which Cuba manufactures and which Rio authorities requested to fight an outbreak here, he indicated a Brazilian national commission is still examining it in order to approve it being imported. He added Cuba can wait for those results because its health authorities are convinced the vaccine is effective, given its parameters comply with all international regulations and was successfully used in Cuba during a mass immunization campaign. In the area of general Brazilian-Cuban cooperation, he said Brazilian firms provide specific services to companies with concessions for petroleum-producing studies in Cuba, but he stated there were no talks on petroleum during this visit. In the agricultural field, he expressed Cuba's interest in intensively studying Brazil's experience with alternating sugar cane and soybeans crops in the same soil. Regarding Cuba's situation, he said it is expected that in 1994, along with economic growth in tourism and the production of domestic petroleum, there will be an upsurge in other economic sectors that have been in decline. This will depend, he clarified, on various factors, including the fluctuation of prices on the international market, and, because of the complexity of that situation, he suggested caution in making predictions. Finally, regarding Cuban predictions for economic relations with the United States if that country lifts the blockade, Lage said that in the last few months the Clinton administration has intensified the blockade and approved the Torricelli Law. "At this time, we are not yet in a condition to anticipate that situation with the United States," he stressed.
