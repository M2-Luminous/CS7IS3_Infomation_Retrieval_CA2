Deep-sea fibre optics cable is a kind of fibre optics communications cable laid on seabeds. Such cables must be highly resistant to water and corrosion, and must be able to withstand heavy pounding from the sea. So far such cables are only produced by a handful of developed countries such as the United States, Germany, and Britain. Our successful invention was the result of joint research begun last May by the Zaozhuang Hengli Optics Communications Company and the No.8 Research Center affiliated to the Ministry of Electronics Industry. Tests conducted by fibre optics communications research and monitoring centers in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Wuxi, and other localities have proved that the cable's performance has reached or surpassed similar products produced abroad. Batch production of the cables has begun.
