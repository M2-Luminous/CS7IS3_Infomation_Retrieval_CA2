Rivkin (jointly with Multinational Strategies, Inc. --experts on state risk in Central and East European Countries): "There Is a Need To Have a Will and a Way To Pay Debts"; first paragraph is introductory paragraph] [Text] The credits issued by foreign banks to Vnesheconombank (Foreign Economic Bank) have lost 50% of their value since early December. Western investors discuss further prospects with enhanced interest. A government's ability to pay debts is determined by two fundamental reasons: the possibility to pay and a desire to pay. At present, the Russian government's ability to pay debts on time has lowered due to the costly attempts to keep the ruble rate from sharply falling. It was estimated that in the most turbulent week of January these attempts cost the government approximately from one to 1.4 billion. The inflationary consequences of economic policy will adversely affect subsequent economic development and add to the already powerful leakage of capitals. This will slow down the growth of new resources and be instrumental in the further depletion of the existing ones, whereas all this taken together will tell on solvency in respect to credits. These negative economic trends will force Russia to seek external sources of financing, such as from the IMF. It has to be admitted that the Russian government's desire to pay debts has likewise been lowered. It looks as if those who form Russia's policy are not at all worried over the menacing prospect that access to credit markets could be closed in the event of failure to pay the debt. The West has little faith in financial threats and promises. And, lastly, in keeping with the Constitution of Russia and with Yeltsin's Decree of November 1993, parliament alone can determine the size of foreign loans and draw up the federal budget. However, considering the character of the new parliament and its literal understanding of the Constitution, the government will have to carefully analyze and weigh up which conditions of paying the debt parliament will see as acceptable. The aforesaid makes it possible to understand why the price of Russia's debt has been lowered. However, an agreement with the IMF on the deferral of payment could overturn this entire scenario and enable Russia to somewhat brace itself before beginning to pay the debt. The importance of this agreement is evidenced by the fact that in the draft of the 1994 Russian budget the sum earmarked for the payment of the debt (6.4 billion dollars) roughly equals the sum of the new offered foreign credits. (2.5 billion are expected to be borrowed from international financial organizations.) How real the prospect of reaching an agreement is depends on Russia's specific policy. The IMF would like to conclude such an agreement, but as we all know, a tango needs two. Russia's Different Liabilities for Its Debts Eurobonds of Vnesheconombank These bonds have three positive characteristics meriting attention. First, since the moment of their emission in 1988-1990 there has not been a case of non-payment on these bonds. Second, non-payment on international bonds always has greater significance (price) than the non-payment of commercial bank credits on international markets. This is explained by the fact that the international markets of securities are more effective, and therefore a bad reputation on these markets is particularly undesirable. Third, payments on these bonds were relatively small in 1994. The full package of these shares gives an interest to approximately the sum of 115 million. Finance Ministry's Dollar Bonds The principal drawback of these bonds stems from the fact that the Russian government is the heir to the former Soviet government with its traditional non-payments on internal state bonds. And the political culture, enabling the government to handle its people in this way, is being changed at a very slow pace. Not long ago the Russian authorities again demonstrated their scorn for their citizens' financial interests when they withdrew from turnover the rubles emitted prior to 1993 -- this campaign was poorly prepared and organized. In this way, the drawbacks of the financial policy have the effect that at the given moment all hopes in connection with paying the debt are pinned on foreign credits. In a crisis-like situation it is logical to use these credits primarily for the purpose of keeping communication lines open and honoring international debt liabilities to the detriment of innerstate ones. (The total sum needed for the repayment of domestic bonds in 1994 comes to roughly 500 million dollars.) One more negative moment consists in the relative non-liquidity of these bonds in comparison with Eurobonds. The longer terms of payment (repayment) on these bonds do not permit them to be quoted at foreign banks. Vnesheconombank's Debts to Foreign Commercial Banks The total sum of this debt (on which interest is accrued) is roughly 20 billion dollars, which is roughly four billion more than the fixed interest on payment. Of the three main types of debt liabilities this debt is the most susceptible to both positive and negative factors. Therefore it is more liable to fluctuations in the rate of prices. This debt is the biggest and most liquid of the three. The positive moment consists in the fact that, to all appearances, the Russians have continued acting in accordance with the terms of the agreement reached last summer on payments for 1993 -- in keeping with which Russia must pay the incomplete interests on 500 million in exchange for a deferral of the payment for five-ten years. This is attested by the sum earmarked in the draft budget for the payment of the debt. The negative moment, however, is that a concrete debtor was discussed at the talks and the question is in whether it is possible to present a suit to the Russian state in the event of non-payment. Any steps in the direction of fulfilling the reached agreement are important to keep the price of the debt (the rate of prices) alive. Whether it will be possible to reach such an agreement relative to payment in 1994 and further on depends on the general international situation. A worsening of Russia's economic position adds to its dependence on foreign creditors. There is also a need to note the circumstance that the fright triggered by the elections and the subsequent development of events has led to greater pliability on the part of commercial banks -- they have shown a leniency to negotiate even on terms offered by Russia. One analyst has surmised that the banks may even go to the length of forgiving debts, although nothing has yet been said about this anywhere. Forecast Considering the present-day trends, it is safe to surmise most likely that in the next six months the Russian government will continue claiming that it remains true to the policy of reforms. Though in view of this it will continue printing money and not permit itself to take care of inflationary consequences. Such actions will soon lead to a growth of inflation, a fall in the ruble rate and a general deterioration of the economic situation. It is not ruled out that by the summer the worsening of the economic situation will lead to a search for new ways of economic development and a resurgence of the dispute between reformers and conservatives. And in the second half of the year the results of this dispute will tell on the price (rate) of Russia's debt. Another major moment, which may subsequently influence the prices of the debt, is the outcome of elections in Germany. Chancellor Kohl is directly linked to the moral and financial support being rendered to Russia by German banks. The large-scale character of this aid places the German banks in opposition to the likely variant of the Brady plan which, among other things, implies forgiving the debt should this question arise at the talks. The new government will not consider itself to be bound by liabilities on extended credits and therefore (although every possible kind of financial considerations may also exist on this score) it may fully support the Brady plan. It is important to stress, however, that the mere fact of Kohl's defeat at the coming elections alone will not lead to a rise in prices -- the new government will have to announce its concrete policy on this question. It is also important that as of today the Brady plan does not figure in any talks on debts. New York
