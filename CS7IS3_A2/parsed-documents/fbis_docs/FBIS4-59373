The fighting between the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK of Jalal Talabani) and the Democratic Party of Kurdistan (DPK of Mas'ud Barzani) ended early this week, they said. The DPK has taken the control of the northwestern of Kurdistan around the town of Dahuk, while the PUK had seized the southeast, around al-Sulaymaniyah, an AFP correspondent said. The two groups share with the Iraqi National Congress (INC) the province of Irbil in the middle of the Kurdish-controlled area of northern Iraq. The INC, which says it represents all the Kurdish and Arab factions opposed to Iraqi President Saddam Husayn, brokered a ceasefire agreement on Sunday. It is based in Salah al-Din near Irbil. The fighting erupted after a private quarrel, the PUK said. The only clause of the ceasefire so far implemented provides for INC militiamen to control checkpoints in the Irbil province, along with equal numbers of PUK and DPK fighters. INC official Kan'an Makkiyah told AFP Muslim Shiite fighters from southern Iraq were chosen to be deployed on the checkpoints. The two remaining clauses of the May 8 agreement, that have not been yet implemented, provide for prisoner exchanges and the handing back of captured offices. Makkiyah said the PDK [as received] has given the INC, which is to supervise the prisoners exchange, a list of 93 people were being held by the PUK. A DPK official denied his group attacked the PUK in Dahuk. "We only surrounded their offices to force them to surrender peacefully," he told AFP. PUK spokesman Muhammad Tawfiq said his faction "has taken over" the DPK offices in al-Sulaymaniyah only after its own offices in Dahuk were attacked. Most of the casualties followed the PUK assault on Qal'at Dizah and Raniyah, near the Iranian border, on May 2, sources from both parties said. Twelve were killed in al-Sulaymaniyah and 12 in Salah al-Din. The official Iranian news agency IRNA reported on Monday that 2,800 were killed in the fighting.
