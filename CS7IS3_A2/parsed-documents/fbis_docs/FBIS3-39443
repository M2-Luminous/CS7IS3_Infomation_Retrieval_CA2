Granting independence to the Bank would be the "most likely" way of achieving long-term, sustainable growth with low inflation, he said, but this could only happen when there was a consensus on the case for monetary stability. "I think it would be helpful if there were that understanding," he said. "It would help us to achieve price stability which would enable the economy to grow in a more stable way and help reduce the risks of boom and bust." Mr George, appearing on London Weekend Television's Walden programme, said it was appropriate to talk about a switch to independent accountability for the Bank, rather than pure independence. "Our task would be specified within a statutory framework set out by the government," he said. He envisaged that parliament would define the objectives of monetary policy by setting an inflation target. Mr George agreed politicians had become more attuned to the dangers of inflation but said they remained subject to short-term pressures which might make them take a risk which the Bank would not. Mr George denied that the Bank would be "consistently tighter" on interest rates than under present arrangements. He and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, saw "very much eye to eye" in the present circumstances. "But there would be circumstances where we would want to see interest rates higher than the government, because we would not be facing the same short-term political pressures." The governor indicated that tomorrow's inflation report from the Bank would contain a much more positive assessment of the long-term prospects for inflation. "The recorded level of inflation is increasing as it is bound to do because of the impact of indirect tax increases, but the underlying level of inflation is comfortably within the government's target for the time being," he said. "We don't expect it to rise over the far-out period but you will have to wait to see the detail." Many City analysts believe the government will cut interest rates before the end of the year to soften the impact of tax increases. But there is a growing feeling that it will not want to take any risks with inflation and that the next move in interest rates will be up.
