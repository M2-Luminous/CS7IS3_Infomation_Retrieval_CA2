I certify that the following action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major factors considered for this certification were: 1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities other than the small organizations that will furnish the services to the Government. 2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on current contractors for the services. 3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish the services to the Government. 4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c) in connection with the services proposed for addition to the Procurement List. Accordingly, the following services are hereby added to the Procurement List: Grounds Maintenance, Koritz Memorial Garden, Brooks Air Force Base, Texas Janitorial/Custodial, 928th Airlift Group (AFRES), except Building 4, O'Hare International Airport Air Reserve Station, Chicago, Illinois Operation of Copy Distribution Center for the following Department of Energy locations: Forrestal Building, Washington, DC, 1615 M Street, Washington, DC, 19901 Germantown Road, Germantown, Maryland This action does not affect current contracts awarded prior to the effective date of this addition or options exercised under those contracts.
