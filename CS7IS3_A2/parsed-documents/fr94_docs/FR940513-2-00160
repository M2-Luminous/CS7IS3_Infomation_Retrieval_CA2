FR940513-2-00160 FR940513-2-00081 [Release No. 34&hyph;34027; File No. SR&hyph;MSRB&hyph;94&hyph;4] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board Relating to Procedures for Submitting Information on Political Contributions Pursuant to Rule G&hyph;37 May 9, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on April 22, 1994, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``Board'' or ``MSRB'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The purpose of the proposed rule change is to provide procedures for submitting information on political contributions pursuant to rule G&hyph;37. The Board has requested accelerated approval of the proposed rule change in order to allow for the timely submission of, and public access to, information concerning political contributions. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. The Commission also finds good cause for granting accelerated approval of the proposed rule change. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The Board is filing a proposed rule change to establish procedures relating to the submission of information to the Board pursuant to rule G&hyph;37, on political contributions and prohibitions on municipal securities business. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the Board included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change On April 7, 1994, the Commission approved Board rule G&hyph;37 on political contributions and prohibitions on municipal securities business. 1 Rule G&hyph;37(e)(ii) provides that reports on contributions made and municipal securities business engaged in during the reporting period must be submitted to the Board on Form G&hyph;37, in accordance with Board rule G&hyph;37 filing procedures, quarterly, with due dates determined by the Board. In its rule G&hyph;37 filing, the Board noted that it was developing appropriate rule G&hyph;37 filing procedures to allow for public access to the information to be submitted on Form G&hyph;37. 2 The current proposed rule change establishes procedures for brokers, dealers and municipal securities dealers for filing with the Board information relating to political contributions as required by rule G&hyph;37. 3 The proposal also establishes procedures for filing voluntary information relating to political contributions. 4 1 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33868 (April 7, 1994), 59 FR 17621 (April 13, 1994). Rule G&hyph;37 became effective April 25, 1994. 2 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33482 (January 14, 1994), 59 FR 3389. 3 In order to assist dealers in complying with rule G&hyph;37 filing requirements, the Board intends to develop an informal ``Procedures Manual'' which will contain the relevant forms and procedures. 4 Brokers, dealers, municipal securities dealers, or others may voluntarily submit to the Board additional information relating to political contributions provided that such information is submitted in accordance with Board rule G&hyph;37 filing procedures. The proposal requires dealers to file two copies of Form G&hyph;37, and to submit such forms within thirty (30) calendar days after the end of each calendar quarter. These dates correspond to January 31, April 30, July 31, and October 31. The Board will maintain one copy of each Form G&hyph;37 off-site for back-up purposes, and will maintain the second copy of each Form G&hyph;37 at its Public Access Facility (``PAF'') in Virginia, where it will be available to the public for review and photocopying. 5 The Board also will maintain a database of reports filed by each dealer (as well as any other party voluntarily submitting information on political contributions), so that any member of the public may telephone the Board's offices to inquire whether a particular dealer (or other party) has submitted a report pursuant to rule G&hyph;37. 6 To further enhance public access to this information, the Board will provide a list of companies that offer document retrieval and mailing services. As the Board gains experience with rule G&hyph;37 submission procedures, and as the informational needs of the municipal market change with regard to political contributions, the Board will seek to expand the access and services available to the public. 5 The Board will charge 20 cents per page plus sales tax, if applicable, for photocopying. This is the same pricing structure currently used for photocopying official statements and advance refunding documents at the PAF. 6 In addition to the dealer's name, the information available through the database will include, among other things, the quarterly period covered by the report and summary information on political contributions. Although rule G&hyph;37 requires dealers to report certain summary information concerning contributions, it does not require disclosure of the names of individual municipal finance professionals or executive officer contributors. While the rule G&hyph;37 procedures will result in many dealers filing forms at or about the same time, the Board believes that it can adequately process this information in a timely manner. However, if such processing becomes unduly burdensome for the Board, then it may consider staggering dealer submission due dates in the future. In addition, if the number of voluntary submissions substantially increases the Board's costs of processing this information, then it may consider charging a filing fee to cover some of the expenses associated with certain of this voluntarily submitted information. Finally, the Board, in the future, may review the necessity for, and propriety of, charging an access fee for the forms filed, if any, pursuant to rule G&hyph;37.
