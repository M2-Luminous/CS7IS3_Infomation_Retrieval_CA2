It was not immediately clear if the plane was the German-registered Cessna aircraft that disappeared last week shortly before landing at the Alternrhein airstrip near here with 70 kilograms of radioactive caesium-137 aboard. A robot sub would be sent down Wednesday to inspect the wreckage, police said. Geiger counter readings taken near the wreckage Tuesday did not show any increased radiation, police said. The lake supplies drinking water to four million people in northern Switzerland.
