Gutu, first vice president and general director of the Union of Industrialists of the Republic of Moldova, by Ya. Guryevich; place and date not given: "`I Remain a Communist, But...'"] [Text] His is the typical biography of a party official who has traveled a long route from local Komsomol officer to the highest pinnacles of power. The memorable August of 1991 found him in the office of second secretary of the Communist Party of Moldova Central Committee. Now I.T. Gutu is first vice president and general director of the Union of Industrialists of the Republic of Moldova with, as might have been expected, his own vision of the social and political situation in the republic, his own understanding of the problems that have risen to confront it, and his own view of a way out of the present situation. This is the subject of our discussion. [Guryevich] Does it not seem to you, Ivan Timofeyevich, that we have today essentially been driven into a corner, from which we can neither get things moving nor extricate ourselves? [Gutu] If we consider the wholesale impoverishment of the people, this is not a corner but a dead end, perhaps. But this is what was to have been expected, it was this that was forecast right from the start, when many decisions and legislative instruments were adopted in forced manner, under pressure from the street and the period of demonstrations, which led not to the appeasement of society but to the even greater destabilization of the situation. [Guryevich] But new people, who declared themselves true democrats and who knew well what the ordinary people needed, came to power at that time.... [Gutu] There were not then nor are there with us now democrats in the true sense, unfortunately. Even less can people with extremely radical views be such. So we acquired, in fact, a new elite, even more avid for power and uncompromisingly brazen, inasmuch as it had emerged on the wave of national self-awareness, and shamelessly bent on distributive functions and the satisfaction of personal, primarily material, ambitions. Apartments, country cottages, automobiles, overseas travel--I shall not give examples, they are there for all to see. [Guryevich] Well, we assume that the former authorities did not short-change themselves in this respect either.... [Gutu] Had this been combined with constructive work, as before, but everything moved in the entirely opposite direction. What did Mircea Druc and his government do? What in practice could they have done? They drove away the skilled personnel, destroyed the machinery of state, and engendered an atmosphere of violence, lawlessness, national discord, and intolerance in a formerly peaceful and materially prosperous republic. Not only did they not do anything of substance, they were even powerless to offer some in any way constructive program. [Guryevich] Yes, but the acquisition of sovereignty and independence and recognition in the United Nations and the CSCE and entry into the world community come from that same period.... [Gutu] Of course, these were necessary and very important stages of the formation of the young state. The exchange of embassies and delegations, treaties.... But real recognition comes only via internal stability and the material well-being of society. But we have neither stability nor well-being but, in addition, the unresolved problems of the South and the eastern regions.... We still do not know, incidentally, the true inspiration behind both the memorable campaign against the South, when bloodshed was avoided only by a miracle, and the Bendery tragedy, which cost us hundreds of human lives, thousands of devastated futures, and many billions of rubles of material damage. We are all still making do with a half-truth.... [Guryevich] You believe, Ivan Timofeyevich, that the new governing elite had, aside from elements of populism and political intriguing, nothing to its name? And that our main scourge today is the absence of professional know-how and management skills and incompetence? [Gutu] If we are speaking of the first governments, undoubtedly. The material base, which had been created over decades, was thoroughly undermined, and highly professional, technically equipped industrial outfits partly broke up and partly switched to semi-crafts production (if only to survive!)--and not only in "defense" either: machine building, instrument making, and electronics, without which we could, at the very least, still hold on somehow--but also in the traditional sectors of vital importance to us--light, food, processing. And if today some enterprises are still managing to stay afloat, it is only thanks to the inconceivable doggedness and self-sacrifice of the corps of directors. [Guryevich] I have to agree, nonetheless--not in defense of the present rulers but solely from an aspiration to objectivity--were the previous authorities more competent? [Gutu] Without a doubt! [Guryevich] What, then, about the Ribnita metallurgical giant, which had still been deprived of a raw material base even then? And the Pamyat Ilichu Interkolkhoz Nursery, the "biggest in Europe"--whereas the vegetable repositories and processing industry were incapable of accepting even one-half of the produce cultivated there? And the triumphal laying, to victory fanfares, of the canal from Lake Yalpug, into which billions had been poured and which, upon inspection, resulted in an environmental catastrophe? Not to mention the dozens of not so costly but no less odious construction projects, in the capital included. [Gutu] It is more appropriate to speak here not of the degree of competence but, rather, of the volitional methods of leadership--after all, scientific potential was always enlisted in the preliminary consultations.... [Guryevich] But it was, ultimately, one person who decided.... [Gutu] Voluntarism, as a style of leadership, was condemned by the party itself.... [Guryevich] Following the ouster or death of the latest leader? So even then there was not at the time of decisionmaking a whiff of democracy even? [Gutu] Nonetheless, compare if only the authorities with which the cities and districts of the republic were endowed at that time and today's essentially total anarchy of the official structures. Is this not the reason also to some extent for the troubles that have come crashing down on our capital--the menacing state of the engineering utilities, health care, urban mass transit.... Decrees were adopted twice formerly at the top level, in the CPSU Central Committee, on the development of Chisinau, and they were implemented. But whose business of anyone's is this now? Who would venture to forecast what awaits the capital's 700,000-strong population in the near future? So I would not censure our past indiscriminately--what was positive and constructive in it was not that insignificant. Now, on the other hand, privatization has been mounted at a forced pace, and this will, in my view, produce no appreciable improvement in people's lives. This can already be seen clearly in the example of services. [Guryevich] Should this be understood to mean, Ivan Timofeyevich, that you are opposed to radical reforms in the economy altogether? [Gutu] Nothing of the sort, I am opposed to certain methods and their forced implementation. I am profoundly convinced that small business cannot occupy the predominant place in the economy and that the fate of the latter is decided by large-scale enterprises. Even to take a look at foreign experience, we would be better suited by the Chinese method--state regulation with elements of a market economy.... [Guryevich] With the guiding and directing role of the Communist Party?... [Gutu] At least they have managed to feed more than 1 billion people and raise national income immeasurably. And on this path we could, if not achieve the former level, in the next two or three years at least approach it and stabilize the situation. For this it is essential, first, that the economy cease to be a hostage to policy, second, to restore the broken economic ties to the countries of the CIS, and, third, determine precisely what kind of industry and what kind of products we need for the foreign market, and what kind, for domestic consumption. [Guryevich] Well, the Union of Industrialists holds the cards, as they say.... [Gutu] Our union does not possess power functions, it can only offer its vision of the present situation and its forecasts for the future and the corresponding recommendations. Which, generally, is what we have been doing since the recent conference of the union. Specifically, we believe that the state should display initiative in the organizational restructuring of industry and provide for the elaboration and realization of sector-by-sector outlines and industrial joint labor in multilateral cooperation with Romania, Ukraine, Russia, and other countries of the CIS and Europe. We, on the other hand, are prepared to help the government in the realization of our proposals. [Guryevich] And? [Gutu] I would like to hope that the new government will give this and our other recommendations due attention. [Guryevich] But if blame for the severance of economic relations could be imputed to the former government, this cannot be said about the present one. Or, come to that, about the president, who signed the documents on entry into the CIS, on the formation of the economic space, and so forth. So where does the problem lie? [Gutu] Yes, they should be given their due for this. But many questions remain, and, it seems to me, it would be highly appropriate for the deputies, who are intending once again to run for the new parliament, to address them now, in the election campaign. And not only in economics. It would not be inappropriate, I believe, for the new parliament to also reconsider certain previous legislative instruments--on the national anthem and so forth, in particular. [Guryevich] Well, it remains to be hoped that the new parliament and the new government will prove receptive to a mutual exchange of ideas and be more decisive in the pursuit of a balanced policy. [Gutu] That's what I say: Much will depend on who sits in the old chairs. The abundance of parties and movements with similar programs and the like ambitions of their leaders could seriously disorient the electorate. [Guryevich] Have you remained in the Communist Party? [Gutu] I was and remain a Communist. But in a renewed party which, together with the modified name (it is now the Party of Communists of Moldova), is also jettisoning certain tenets of Marxism-Leninism and adopting new, approved methods of political activity. [Guryevich] Frankly, it had always seemed to me that by no means a secondary role had been made ready for you also in the new elite which came to power at the end of the 1980's. But two "gaffes," which in the thinking of the "true democrats" damaged your image somewhat, made themselves felt, evidently. I refer to the summer of 1990, when you, together with the entire party upper stratum, appeared at the Zelenyy Theater before a thousands-strong meeting. Although, incidentally, as mayor of the capital, not a party functionary at that time, you could have diplomatically declined. As did Nicolae Tau, while even first secretary of the capital's city party committee in those days.... [Gutu] It was impossible for me to decline for one reason: It was I who had the whole time been stirring up the republic's party leadership, calling on it to show up at the demonstrations, enter into a dialogue with people, and explain its position, not sit it out in offices. [Guryevich] Very well, the second "gaffe"--the office of secretary of the Communist Party of Moldova Central Committee, when the party's affairs were already on very shaky ground? [Gutu] Not long before that the decision had been made in Moscow that the republic's party organization would be headed by P.K. Lucinschi. It was only by keeping this in mind that I agreed: I had known Lucinschi a long time and believed that in a team with him something could still be done.... [Guryevich] Now, apparently, there is a Communist Party once again, only renewed.... But this party will not take part in the parliamentary elections inasmuch as it was not in time to register before the start of the campaign. So you will, consequently, have to call on your supporters to vote for the slates of other parties, will you not? [Gutu] Yes, ahead of us are a congress and the formulation and adoption of a program and only then involvement in assertive political activity. Meanwhile, we will, indeed, support other parties at the elections--those that advocate a strengthening of Moldova's independence and sovereignty, an immediate normalization of the situation in the South and in the eastern regions, the ratification of all economic agreements within the framework of the CIS and the conclusion of beneficial bilateral treaties with these countries, national referenda on problems that are fateful for the state and, most important, an increase in our people's prosperity. [Guryevich] And what parties are these? [Gutu] Not all have made their election platforms public as yet. But judging by what is already known about their intentions and final goals, they are the Agrarian-Democratic and Socialist Parties. [Guryevich] And are you not embarrassed by the fact that the platform of the Socialist Party, say, is once again interspersed with certain decrepit ideological myths--like free housing and low rent and free education and health care--although even the youngest schoolboys now know that there is in fact nothing that is or can be free, that the resources for the so-called "freeness," and considerable ones at that, were shamelessly taken from the working people themselves.... [Gutu] Yes, some of the wording is, truly, embarrassing. But the right to free housing, education, and health care for a particular section of the needy population should, indeed, be guaranteed by the state. [Guryevich] Our interview is coming to an end, and I will, therefore, ask you a question that is by no means new but highly popular in such situations: If you could begin everything all over again.... [Gutu] I regret nothing, and nothing in my life inspires in me feelings of awkwardness or shame.
