FR940414-1-00077 FR940414-1-00010 E. Foreign Trade Effects Products of the PFPR industry are traded internationally. Therefore, changes in domestic production resulting from effluent regulations may affect the balance of trade. EPA evaluated the potential foreign trade impacts of the PFPR regulation by separately estimating the changes in both exports and imports that could occur as a result of a PSES regulation for Subcategory C (PFPR) Facilities. EPA analyzed foreign trade impacts under two cases: a proportional case, which assesses trade impacts based on the relative competitiveness of U.S. and foreign producers in international markets; and a worst case, which makes severely conservative assumptions regarding U.S. competitiveness. Both analyses showed relatively minor trade impacts from the regulatory option, Option 3/S. Trade impacts were examined for the six PSES options considered for Subcategory C Facilities. Among these options, the estimated impacts of proposed Option 3/S are the least severe under both the worst-case and proportional case assumptions. 1. Proportional Case The analysis of trade impacts focuses on the PFPR sales of facilities that are assessed as closures or line conversions as the result of the PFPR rule. When a facility ceases PFPR production, the markets that it served, both domestic and export, are assumed to be competed for by other domestic producers and foreign producers. Under the proportional case assumptions, domestic and foreign producers share in these markets on a proportional basis according to their average participation in domestic and export markets before regulation. These assumptions allow foreign producers to compete away a share of both the sales to domestic production and sales for export that had previously been supplied by the impacted facilities. The shares of these markets that are won by foreign producers reflect the long-run success of foreign and domestic producers in competing for domestic and export markets. In effect, the proportional case assumes that foreign and domestic producers would remain as competitive on the margin in capturing domestic and export PFPR markets as they are currently on average. Specifically, exports decline as domestic producers are assumed to capture 30.2 percent of impacted facilities' former exports while foreign producers capture 69.8 percent of this amount. And imports increase as domestic producers are assumed to retain 82.1 percent of impacted facilities' former sales for domestic consumption, while foreign producers capture 17.9 percent. The estimated decrease in exports (stated as a positive value) and increase in imports are summed to yield the estimated decline in the U.S. PFPR trade balance. Under the proportional case assumptions, the estimated trade impact under Option 3 amounts to a $9,872,000 decrease in the pesticide trade balance, or a 1.04 percent decline. Option 3/S would result in a $9,190,000 decrease in the pesticide trade balance, or a decline of less than one percent (see Table 11 below). 2. Worst-Case The worst-case analysis again begins with foreign and domestic producers competing to capture the domestic and export PFPR sales of facilities that were assessed as closures or line conversions as the result of the PFPR regulation. Under the worst-case assumptions, however, foreign producers are assumed to win this competition completely. That is, the sales for domestic consumption are fully replaced by increased imports and the sales for export are fully replaced by foreign producers. These assumptions maximize the possible adverse trade impact associated with reduced production and sales of PFPR products by significantly impacted facilities. The estimated decline in exports (stated as a positive number) and increase in imports are summed to yield the decline in the balance of trade in the PFPR market. This analysis makes severe and unrealistic assumptions, but serves to illustrate the minimal impact that the regulation is expected to have on foreign trade, even under the most conservative assumptions. Under the worst-case assumptions a decrease of $43,995,000 in the net trade balance (4.6 percent) is projected under Option 3, and a decrease of $40,184,000 (4.2 percent) is calculated for the proposed option, Option 3/S (see Table 11).

Impacts on Firms Owning PFPR Facilities The assessment of economic achievability of the PFPR regulation is based primarily on the facility-level impact analysis. However, because the impacts at the level of the firm may exceed those assessed at the level of the facility, particularly when a firm owns more than one facility that will be subject to regulation, EPA also conducted a firm-level impact analysis for the PFPR regulation. The firm-level analysis estimates the impact of regulatory compliance on firms owning facilities subject to PFPR effluent guidelines. A firm-level analysis was conducted for all firms which own at least one sample facility that uses water in its PFPR operations, and therefore for which financial data were available. Because of sample design considerations, the findings from the firm-level analysis, which is based on facilities in the sample survey, cannot be extrapolated on a statistically valid basis to the population level of PFPR industry firms. The firm-level impact analysis involves aggregating financial and compliance cost data for sample facilities by firm. Compliance cost data for the sample facilities within a firm were then used to impute compliance costs for the portion of a firm's PFPR revenue that was not covered by the data for sample facilities. Baseline cost adjustments from other regulatory requirements were also included in the firm-level analysis and were apportioned to those revenues within the firm that were not reflected by sample facilities. The firm-level financial impact was assessed on the basis of change in pre-tax return on assets (ROA) taking into account the expected compliance requirements for sample facilities and the portion of a firm's PFPR revenue that was not covered by the data for sample facilities. ROA was calculated for the baseline and post-compliance, and compared with a threshold value based on the lowest quartile data for SIC codes in the 2800 group (Chemicals and Allied Products) of 2.396 percent. 10 ROA is a measure of the profitability of a firm's capital assets, independent of the effects of taxes and financial structure. This financial measure provides information regarding the competitive position of the firm within the industry, as well as operating margin and asset management capability. If a firm cannot sustain a competitive ROA when baseline costs and compliance costs are considered, then the firm will likely have difficulty financing the costs of complying with the regulation. 10 The threshold value ROA (2.396 percent) was calculated by weighting the ROA for all available SIC codes in the 2800 group by the total value of shipments of that group.
