The following is the text of the agreement: Following the heinous crime in Hebron and in accordance with Security Council Resolution 904, the Israeli and PLO delegations met in Cairo on 23 March and agreed to adopt the following measures to meet the increasing security needs of the Palestinians, especially in Hebron. This agreement led to resuming the talks between the two sides to implement the Gaza-Jericho agreement as soon as possible. A. [letter as received] A temporary international presence in Hebron. Israel believes this presence should be for observation purposes, while the PLO believes it should be for the purpose of meeting the Palestinians' need for security and stability by helping with observation and submitting reports on the acts that affect the safety of the Palestinians and their property, which will encourage the return of normal life among the Palestinians. To facilitate the tasks of the international observer force, an office will be set up in Hebron. The office will submit periodic reports to the joint Israeli-Palestinian Liaison Affairs Committee to be formed in accordance with the Declaration of Principles. The international observer force will submit reports on specific incidents to the Joint Hebron Committee composed of the Israeli military governor of Hebron, the Palestinian mayor of Hebron, and the commander of the soon-to-be-formed Palestinian police for the town. The PLO believes an invitation should be sent to the representative of the international observer force to participate in the meetings of the Joint Liaison Affairs Committee. Israel believes the members of the international observer force should wear civilian clothes and carry pistols, while the PLO believes they should wear official uniforms with special insignia to be agreed upon by the two sides, that their cars carry this insignia, and that they be armed with light weapons for self-defense in Hebron. Israel believes the international observer force should number 20. The PLO believes their number should be 200 in addition to an enhanced role for the International Committee of the Red Cross by raising the number of its team to 30 representatives. Israel demands that the financiers appoint 20 Norwegian civilians while the PLO demands that the financiers should appoint 200 individuals from their own citizens as observers on condition that the first batch will be appointed from Norway, Egypt, and the United States. The duties of the international observer force are to provide a sense of security for the Palestinian residents of Hebron and create the appropriate atmosphere leading to strengthening the prosperity and economic progress of the Palestinians. The duty of this force is also to supervise the return of normal life to Hebron and to complete reports on that. The members of the international observer force will enjoy freedom of movement to perform their duties. This freedom will not be limited for any reason other than compelling military requirements, which will be temporary and extraordinary measures. The financing countries will bear the expenses of the force. The International Red Cross is asked to expand and intensify its activities in Hebron by increasing its staff to 30 individuals. The force can proceed with its work as soon as the agreement is signed. Israel is demanding that the term of the observer force be three months while the PLO is demanding a one-year term with the approval of the two sides, which can be extended in accordance with the agreement. Regarding the deployment and activity of the Palestinian authority in Hebron and without prejudicing Israel's authority and its responsibility for security and public order, the two sides agreed on the formation of the Palestinian police and its work in the town. Israel demands that the police number 50 individuals while the PLO demands that it number 400 policemen who will be chosen and appointed by the directorate of the Palestinian police force that will be formed in Gaza and Jericho. The duties of the Palestinian police in the town will be to protect public establishments and the Palestinian installations on which agreement will be reached and to participate in joint patrols. The police will periodically hold contacts with the directorate of the Palestinian police force to receive general instructions, training, and administrative duties connected with it. The Palestinian police will submit its reports to the Joint Liaison Affairs Committee, which will define the daily activity of the Palestinian police personnel in coordination with the Israeli security and police forces. Israel's collective responsibility for security will be recognized. To coordinate between the Palestinian and Israeli police, the Joint Liaison Affairs Committee will set up a coordinating bureau in Hebron administered jointly and working 24 hours a day. The committee will define all details regarding the structure and tasks of the Hebron police coordinating bureau. Israel demands that the Palestinian policemen in Hebron wear ordinary clothes and carry pistols while the PLO demands that they wear a special uniform with an insignia, carry light weapons, and that their cars carry special insignia to be agreed upon by the Hebron coordinating committee. The two sides will negotiate in Cairo on the organizational structure of the Palestinian police in the town and on its equipment and vehicles. The Palestinian police in Hebron will work in accordance with a special decree issued by the military governor defining its duties and tasks. As for regulations governing the joint police patrols, the duties of which are to provide security for the Palestinians, observe the situation, and compile reports on it, Israel believes that these patrols should be the same as the patrols in the city of Hebron and consist of two Palestinian policemen and two Israeli policemen in one vehicle driven by an Israeli officer of a higher rank. The PLO believes that there should be two four-wheeled vehicles, one Palestinian and the other Israeli. The vehicle [not further specified] will be distinguished from other vehicles in the area and driven by an Israeli officer of a higher rank. He should be in contact with the police coordination office. The Joint Hebron Committee is specifying and equipping the number of patrols, defining their duties, and drawing up the course of their patrol and the routes they should follow. In the agreement, Israel affirmed its responsibility for the safety of all Palestinians and Israelis in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, including the city of Hebron. It will continue to implement all the necessary measures to avert any conflict between the settlers and the Palestinians and to prevent acts of violence by the settlers. With respect to the Gaza-Jericho agreement, the two sides agreed to resume the Gaza-Jericho negotiations today, Tuesday, and to speed them up to make up for lost time. Israel will reduce the period of the withdrawal schedule and adhere to the dates specified in the Declaration of Principles. Immediately after finalizing the Gaza-Jericho agreement, the negotiations on the early transfer of authority will start. The two sides will then discuss the possibility of expanding the scope of negotiations and resuming them over the transitional arrangements in accordance with the Declaration of Principles. The agreement reconfirmed that preparations for the permanent situation will start as soon as possible on condition that they do not continue beyond the third year of the transitional period, as is stipulated in the Declaration of Principles. The gradual entry of the Palestinian police into Gaza and Jericho will start one week after the resumption of the Gaza-Jericho negotiations, so as to start preparations for taking on responsibilities and authority.
