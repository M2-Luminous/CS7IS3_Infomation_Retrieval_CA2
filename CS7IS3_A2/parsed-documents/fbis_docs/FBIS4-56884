Perez Balladares, 47, was proclaimed the Panamanian presidential candidate for the Democratic Revolutionary Party [PRD] on 31 July 1993. He will govern for the next five years, with his two Vice Presidents Tomas Gabriel Altamirano Duque and Felipe Virzy, all founding members of the PRD. "The time of electoral confrontation has passed and we must enter the 21st century with a vision of the future, with a commitment to our children and grandchildren, "without returning to the past or linking with the past," Perez Balladares said in an exclusive interview with LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA. From the opposition PRD campaign headquarters in the International Hotel, Perez Balladares said his election "is a very big challenge which we gladly accept." "We foresaw it a long time ago, as it was predicted by the polls," Perez Balladares stated. "We want to do what we pledged during the campaign, by appealing to all Panamanians for national harmony so that tonight we can close the electoral chapter and join together to work for the best national objectives," Perez Balladares told LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA, after learning the results of the exit poll." Perez Balladares said political banners will return again in five years, "when we have elections again, when the democratic process will again be respected and the winner of the elections will be recognized." Regarding the composition of his council of ministers, once his victory is confirmed, Perez Balladares said he is inviting an undetermined number of "those who have been our adversaries and some independent forces" to join us. "We are sure that very soon we will be able to count on the participation of these gentlemen and on members of our party (the PRD) in a cabinet that will work in harmony for national interests," Perez Balladares added. Regarding relations with the United States, Perez Balladares said that his election "closed the black chapter of military intervention" that began on 20 December 1989. "The election of my government has made it clear that this sad page in the history of both countries has been turned," Perez Balladares stressed. "We hope our relations (with the United States) become better every day because we must cooperate to meet the timetable from now until 31 December 1999," he said. He added that Panama wants "closer" cooperation with the United States on drug trafficking and money laundering, as well as with other countries "which see in the scourge of drug trafficking a national problem as we do." Commenting on the future of the Canal and U.S. military bases, Perez Balladares said that it is best for both countries "to comply with the Torrijos-Carter Treaties." "This means that on 31 December 1999 the Canal will be Panamanian and will be managed totally by Panamanians." According to Perez Balladares, on that day (31 December 1999) there should be no more U.S. troops in Panama, adding that if the United States wants to renegotiate an extension of their presence beyond the year 2000, "they must state that desire." He warned, however, that his government would have to be convinced "that there is a common enemy and that U.S. military interests coincide with Panama's." Perez Balladares said he hopes Panama will return to the times of General Omar Torrijos, when the country was "respected for our dignity and our serious and straightforward attitude." In terms of the country's economic future, he said he will begin a dialogue to introduce Panama into areas that are most appropriate for the country in order to be directly included --without going through regional integration blocs -- in the NAFTA signed by the United States, Canada, and Mexico. "If we do not manage to do this directly, we will begin integration contacts with the Common Market of the South (Mercosur)," he noted. On the subject of banana quotas imposed by the EU since July, Perez Balladares said that the measure "is very harmful" for us and should be resolved through the GATT.
