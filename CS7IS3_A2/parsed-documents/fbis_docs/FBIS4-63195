This is the reason why a news conference by a high- ranking commander always promises something interesting. The meeting with journalists by Colonel General Vladimir Semenov, commander in chief of the Army, which is scheduled for today, is doubly interesting: it will be held on no specific occasion, but against the background of shock experienced by the top brass following the allocation of what the Defense Ministry sees as a negligible sum for the military. General Semenov himself is known for his views that have been fairly frequently at odds with Pavel Grachev's, in particular, on ways of military organization in Russia. The officially stated subject of the news conference -- "The State and Development Prospects of the Army in the Conditions of Military Reform" -- scarcely holds any interest for a wider range of readers. Obviously, following cuts in the military budget "the state and development prospects" of the Army are far from bright. All the more so because these troops will receive a lesser percentage of the defense appropriations than others. Ironically, General Semenov, who formerly fiercely opposed the current contract system of manpower acquisition, will evidently have to be the first to halt this practice because of a lack of funds. What is of much greater interest, however, is how General Semenov will comment on the overall military budget, not just the army budget. Observers do not rule out that he, being a well-known opponent of Pavel Grachev in military affairs, may express the opinion held by a part of the top brass displeased with the defense minister's inability to squeeze out sufficient money for the Armed Forces. If General Semenov dares criticize the minister's policy, this may mean that a serious opposition to Grachev has emerged in the Armed Forces. To criticize without the appropriate support would be rather dangerous even for so high-ranking a commander: recently even multi-star generals live in constant wait for drastic reshuffles. If General Semenov does no overstep the limits of the news conference agenda, however, this will also be full of meaning. The refusal to exploit as advantageous a subject as the budget to criticize an opponent will prove that to all appearances the battle for the Armed Forces' money is not over yet and the generals still pin their hopes on Grachev. If this is so, any criticism of Grachev can be put off until better times, for the infighting could only harm "the common cause:" A high-ranking ministry official told your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent that "the main thing is to get the money, and what will happen afterward is our own business." KOMMERSANT-DAILY will report the results of the news conference tomorrow.
