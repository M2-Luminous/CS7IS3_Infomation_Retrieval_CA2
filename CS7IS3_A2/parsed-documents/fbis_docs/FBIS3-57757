Post of Minister Still Vacant"] [Text] Vladimir Mashchits, former chairman of the State Committee for Economic Cooperation with the CIS Countries, was appointed by government decision yesterday as acting chief of the new Ministry for Cooperation with CIS Member Countries with the rank of first deputy minister. Vladimir Mashchits is 39 years old. Before his appointment as chairman of the State Committee for Economic Cooperation with the CIS Countries [State Cooperation Committee] he was Russia's authorized representative on the Inter-Republican (later Inter-State) Economic Committee; earlier he worked at the Central Economics and Mathematics Institute. Vladimir Mashchits' new appointment can be interpreted as follows: the agency he heads is growing, acquiring new functions and objectives, whereas the former State Cooperation Committee chairman himself is unable to keep pace with the expansion. In fact, figures who not long ago were in charge of Russia's economic relations with the former USSR republics have changed completely. Typically, both Aleksandr Shokhin, recently deputy prime minister and chief supervisor of economic relations with the CIS countries in the Russian Government, and Vladimir Mashchits were relegated to lower rungs of the government hierarchy. In this context it is worth noting that Vladimir Mashchits belongs to the first, "Gaydar" government draft, a fact that could not but influence his effective demotion, although he has never stood out too much. On the whole, however, there is no doubt that Russian CIS policy will have new guidelines. One may even discern what they will be like to a high degree of certainty. To all appearances, geopolitics will take precedence over economic calculations, and integration -- under Russia's aegis and based on resuscitating the ruble zone -- will come to the fore. The Ministry for Cooperation with CIS Member Countries (apparently modeled on the British Ministry of Commonwealth Affairs) has an important role to play because it has been entrusted not only with economic, but also with political functions. And while Vladimir Mashchits performs the duties of an acting minister, a new candidacy is apparently being picked at the political kitchen, a person whose political clout and views should correspond to the new objectives of a new stage in Russia's relations with the former Soviet republics. [Article includes the following boxed passage] -- The State Committee for Economic Cooperation with the CIS Countries was an agency accumulating proposals from all Russia's economic agencies on the development of cooperation with the former USSR republics. Particular importance in the committee's activity was attached to the credit and financial aspects of the cooperation. -- The Ministry for Cooperation with CIS Member Countries, while retaining all the functions of its predecessor, has also taken over political support for the integration.
