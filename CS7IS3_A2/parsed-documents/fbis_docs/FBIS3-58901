Nevertheless, the NATO summit two weeks ago has set decisive signals with its Partnership for Peace initiative, Ruehe said at a security policy conference in Berlin on Monday [24 January]. [passage omitted] Polish Deputy Defense Minister Jerzy Milewski demanded a "political shield" for his country against external threats. The agreed Partnership for Peace was "good for tomorrow, but not good enough for today." The existing threat was less of a military than of a political nature, and had arisen after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the disappearance of the old Soviet Union. Hence, Poland was also seeking less military than political support. Integrating his country into NATO would, in Milewski's view, not in any way be directed against Russia. With reference to Moscow's fears of encirclement, he said it was impossible to see how Moscow's security depended on Poland or Estonia. [passage omitted]
