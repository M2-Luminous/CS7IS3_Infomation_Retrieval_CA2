Point one: The controversy generated by the youth professional training contract (CIP) turned these run-of-the-mill elections into a political test. The prime minister had been careful not to participate in the campaign, not wishing to tie his career to an interrim election that could be the medium for an exaggerated expression of malcontent. The results were so unexpected that he was unable to resist interpreting them as the test that, beforehand, he had played down. That is fair enough. In fact, the second round confirmed that the people refuse to censure the Balladur government, unlike in the previous local elections of 1982, 1985, and 1992, which were used in that way against the Socialist government. The dissatisfaction of various categories of society did not prevent the rejection of Socialist policy nor did it prevent a vote of confidence for the government. Point two: The Left can pride itself on its renewal. The Communist Party has halted its decline and [Socialist Party Secretary General] Michel Rocard is right when he says that his party has made up half of the ground it had lost. The second round evened things up even more. The Right is reassured. It has not been bowed by this first year in power. The rumor of a dissolution of parliament, supposedly to again bring the "real world" into line with the "legal world," is fading. This election gave the government the room for maneuver that even its own majority had balked at granting it. However, the Left is even more reassured. The PS is again becoming France's largest political party. It is fully capable of playing its role of opposition. It is no longer absurd to think that it could win a presidential or legislative election. Tactical withdrawals [at the elections in favor of a better-placed candidate on the same side] and the "republican discipline" went like clockwork, generating a fair degree of surprise. We have returned to the bipolar logic of the regime. The Right has returned to its role of managing and the Left has returned to its role of contesting -- doing what they both do best. The electoral page has been turned. France is faced with its destiny. The real difficulties are just beginning. The streets are ready to explode although the voters have spoken. The government now knows that, while it is opposed by the French who are demonstrating and making trouble, it enjoys the support of the French who voted. The latter would not forgive it if it favored the former. The voters expect the government to energetically continue its policy of reform, for which they voted a year ago and whose legitimacy they have just reconfirmed on its first birthday. You do not govern by bending to the whims of manipulated crowds. However, at the end of the day, nor do you govern a country by opposing youth. The prime minister will need a lot of skill and a lot of tenacity if he is to calm the aberrant expression of justified adolescent anguish. Let us hope that the initiatives he announces will give him the opportunity to do just that.
