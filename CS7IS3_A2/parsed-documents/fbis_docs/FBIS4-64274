Today, Israel and the PLO signed an agreement laying the framework for economic relations between the Jewish state and the self-governing territories under Palestinian control. Trade tariffs, the currency to be used, and taxation policy were at the center of the talks. Here is Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who welcomed both delegations this morning: [Begin Juppe recording] There will be obstacles on the road to peace, there were in the past. All those who prefer war to peace will attempt to derail this process. There were horrendous attacks on both sides, however the process continues. Those who chose peace with great courage and with a sense of responsibility and statesmanship will win, and they deserve admiration, I mean Yitzhaq Rabin, Shim'on Peres, Yasir 'Arafat, and all his team. International affairs bring us their daily share of disasters, from time to time there is an international event to cheer us up. There was the Oslo agreement on 13 September last year, now there are elections in South Africa, a country that I visited two or three months ago. I was also impressed by the role played by two outstanding men, Nelson Mandela and President de Klerk. Despite the attacks, I am convinced that these men and this people have such strength that the future of South Africa can be contemplated with optimism. This is France's belief and France will lend its support. [end recording]
