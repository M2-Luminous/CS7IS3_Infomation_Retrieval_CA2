The scholars at the forum called for giving more priority to basic education while economic development is set as the central task. They noted that leaders at various levels should attach more importance to education. Liu Bin, vice-minister in charge of the State Education Commission, said that development of basic education has seen a decline in China with problems such as shortage of educational funds and postponing payment of teachers' salaries. He said that the problems should be noted in society, especially by leaders at various levels. Gong Yuzhi, deputy director of the party Literature Research Center of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said that the question of education has an important position in Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and urged leaders in central departments and localities to check the tendency to give education short shrift in their economic development. Tao Xiping, director of the Beijing Education Bureau and deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC), said that China's compulsory education law has been promulgated for more than seven years and now a teachers' law has also come into force. He expressed hope that the implementation of the laws of education should be enhanced so as to ensure the strategic position of the development of education. Lei Jieqiong, vice-chairwoman of the NPC Standing Committee, and some leaders of democratic parties also attended the forum.
