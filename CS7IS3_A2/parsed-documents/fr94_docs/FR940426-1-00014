FR940426-1-00014 FR940426-1-00004 Improved communications and information technology also has enabled the exchanges and the NASD to implement sophisticated surveillance systems to detect trading abuses such as those that the Trading Practices Rules were designed to prevent. The NASD's surveillance capabilities were an important consideration when the Commission last year adopted a new exception to Rule 10b&hyph;6, as well as a companion rule, Rule 10b&hyph;6A, 15 to permit ``passive market making'' by Nasdaq market makers. 16 15 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;6A. 16 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32177 (April 8, 1993), 58 FR 19598 (``Passive Market Making Release''). The financial markets themselves have been transformed by a proliferation of options and other derivative products. 17 Market participants use these products to hedge investment risks, increase transaction efficiencies, and profit from market movements. 18 Because stocks were the primary equity instruments for trading and investing at the time the Trading Practices Rules were adopted, it has been necessary to apply these rules to new products through exemptions and interpretations. 19 17 A derivative product is ``a financial instrument that derives its value from the performance of other assets, including securities, rates, or indexes.'' Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32256 (May 4, 1993), 58 FR 27486, 27487 citing Dictionary of Finance and Investment Terms 107 (3d ed. 1991). 18 See, e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission, Division of Market Regulation, The October 1987 Market Break, 3&hyph;1, 3&hyph;5 (1988); Gilberg, Regulation of New Financial Instruments Under the Federal Securities and Commodities Laws, 39 Vand. L. Rev. 1599, 1600 (1986). 19 See, e.g., Letters regarding CXM Baskets (October 15, 1993), and Basket Trading During Distributions (August 6, 1991), [1991] Fed. Sec. L. Rep. (CCH) ¶79,752, both of which granted exemptions from the Trading Practices Rules for transactions in connection with certain index-based stock baskets. The nature of market participants also has changed by virtue of the enhanced market role of institutional investors, such as pension funds, mutual funds, and money managers. In recent years, many individual investors have shifted their funds into pooled investments at a phenomenal rate, which has resulted in an enormous concentration of investment assets in the hands of a relatively small number of market participants. 20 Their economic strength allows large institutions to exert a significant influence on the structuring and pricing of many securities offerings. Some have argued that the presence of these large institutions in securities offerings has transferred the balance of price-setting power from the underwriters to institutional purchasers. 21 Because of this shift, it is argued that antimanipulation regulation should focus not only on the ``sell'' side (e.g., the underwriters), but also on the ``buy'' side. 22 20 See, e.g., Market 2000 Report, Study II: Structure of the U.S. Equity Markets, at II&hyph;1 to II&hyph;3; Fund Assets Surge Past $2 Trillion Mark, With Banks Reporting Solid Sales Gains, Am. Banker, February 1, 1994, at 10, discussing report by the Investment Company Institute that mutual fund assets rose to $2.011 trillion in December 1993, a 26% gain from 1992. 21 At the same time, it should be noted that underwriting revenue in 1993 was a record $9.1 billion. See Siconolfi, Surge in Profits From Fees is Likely to Continue in 1994, Wall St.J., January 3, 1994, at A26. 22 For example, short sales in anticipation of a secondary distribution of securities were addressed by the Commission with the adoption in 1988 of Rule 10b&hyph;21, 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;21. See also Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33702 (March 2, 1994), 59 FR 10984 (``Rule 10b&hyph;21 Release'') (permanent adoption of Rule 10b&hyph;21). The nature of participants in distributions also has changed. Today, distribution participants often are members of complex conglomerates, with many affiliated entities in the United States and abroad. For example, not only have broker-dealers expanded their traditional lines of business, such as retail firms that have merged with exchange specialists, 23 but banking institutions also have established broker-dealer units that are permitted to engage in the underwriting of securities. 24 If one member of a financial conglomerate is a participant in a distribution of securities, all of the affiliates of that entity potentially are subject to the proscriptions of Rule 10b&hyph;6, irrespective of where they are located or conduct business. 23 See, e.g., Letter regarding Application of Rules 10b&hyph;6 and 10b&hyph;13 to Specialists Affiliated with NYSE Member Firms (September 15, 1992), [1992] Fed. Sec. L. Rep. (CCH) ¶76,279, permitting certain NYSE specialists affiliated with broker-dealers to continue to function as specialists while their affiliated broker-dealer participates in certain mergers or tenders or exchange offers. 24 See, e.g., BankAmerica Corp., 79 Fed. Res. Bull. 1163 (1993); J.P. Morgan & Co., 75 Fed. Res. Bull. 192 (1989); Citicorp, 73 Fed. Res. Bull. 473 (1987). The securities distribution process itself has experienced significant developments. Underwriting syndicates, where utilized, tend to be smaller, and shelf registered offerings have become a standard method of raising capital. ``Overselling'' of offerings by underwriting syndicates has become common, resulting in increased aftermarket covering activity by underwriters, and a decrease in formal stabilization activity. Also, rights offerings by U.S. issuers may no longer be as important for capital raising purposes as they were at the time the Trading Practices Rules were adopted, although recently some sectors have experienced a surge in such offerings. Rights offerings continue to be a prevalent form of offering for foreign issuers. 25 25 See Gould, ``Rights Offerings'' at the Wrong Time?, N.Y.
