The Croatian Government believes that the air strikes against the Serb military positions around Gorazde are a legitimate and justified action in support of the implementation of UNPROFOR's [UN Protection Force] mandate in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The statement stresses the fact that the action followed a blatant violation by Serbs of all UN Security Council resolutions and statements on the protection of Gorazde, and was in keeping with a plan of action jointly elaborated by the United Nations and NATO. Besides the immediate effect of stopping Serb advances on central Gorazde, and averting danger to the town and tens of thousands of civilians and refugees, the NATO action undoubtedly has a symbolic significance. The NATO air strikes carried out by U.S. fighter-jets shows that, despite the complexity of international coordination mechanisms, it is possible to reach an effective consent at short notice, and that the international community has enough legitimately adopted documents, measures and responses to counter violators of international norms. The Croatian Government therefore considers the Gorazde action to be the last warning of the international community and a call to certain forces among the Serbian people to stop military activities, blatant violations of international norms and agreements, and to join serious negotiations, in order to find a solution acceptable to all sides and to restore peace, stability, and security in this part of Europe.
