Kozyrev, who has often made contradictory statements and rejected NATO influence in the East as well as a tough military stance against the Serbs in recent weeks, had the joint appeal with Kinkel published in the FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE (Friday [18 February] edition). In the article, the foreign ministers, who are meeting in Athens on Thursday and Friday, conjure up a "long-term strategic vision." The Partnership for Peace offered by NATO is not mentioned, but what is mentioned is a strategy for partnership that must entail support for political and economic reforms in Russia and neighboring countries. According to the paper, the Foreign Ministry stressed that in view of the outcome of the Russian elections, Kozyrev accorded particular importance to continuing free market economic development in drawing up the appeal.
