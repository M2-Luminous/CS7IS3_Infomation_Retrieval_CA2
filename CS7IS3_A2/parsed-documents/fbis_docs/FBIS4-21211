FBIS4-21211 "jptdd017__l94054" JPRS-TDD-94-017-L JPRS Narcotics 11 April 1994 LATIN AMERICA PERU Retired Army Major Charges Bellido, Other Officers Protected Retired Army Major Charges Bellido, Other Officers Protected Traffickers PY1204214694 Madrid EFE in Spanish 2325 GMT 11 Apr 94 PY1204214694 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Lima, 11 Apr (EFE) -- It was disclosed today that a high-ranking Peruvian Army chief has been accused of heading a military organization that protected drug traffickers in exchange for money. General Eduardo Bellido, current Peruvian military attache in Israel, was charged by retired Major Evaristo Castillo with letting drug traffickers operate in Huallaga, where he was political-military commander during 1991 and 1992. Castillo, who said he has been harassed and received death threats, asserted that in 1992 Bellido ordered his troops not to intervene in the struggle against drug trafficking and that they only fought terrorism. The retired Army major stated that the alleged links Peruvian military officers maintained with the drug mafias ``are a complete system'' and that it is not only isolated cases of corruption involving certain officers. He thus disagreed with a recent U.S. State Department report stating that one of the obstacles facing the fight against drug trafficking in Peru is the corruption of police and military officers, but that the problem does not have an institutional character. Castillo stated that in 1992 he witnessed how chiefs of battalions under Bellido's command collected protection fees from drug traffickers to let them operate and then handed that money over to Bellido. As an example he mentioned that the general never ordered the arrest of the most important Peruvian drug trafficker, Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, aka Vaticano, arrested last February in Colombia, ``although he knew where he was through Intelligence Service and DEA reports.'' He also asserted that the Peruvian military also knows where Colombian trafficker Waldo Vargas, aka Ministro, operates and is not doing anything to arrest him.
