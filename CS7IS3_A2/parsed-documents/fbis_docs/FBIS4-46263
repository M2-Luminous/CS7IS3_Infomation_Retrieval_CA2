Nazzal said that the U.S. official's statements are sheer fabrications and part of the false reports claiming that the 'Arafat leadership has succeeded in gaining the support of several Hamas leaders in the occupied territories for the Palestinian authority, thus deviating from the movement's constants of rejecting the capitulatory march and abiding by armed struggle and protracted Jihad until all the Palestinian national soil is liberated. Pelletreau has claimed that a rift recently developed within Hamas in the occupied territories over participation in the Palestinian National Authority.
