In a statement on the latest Cyprus development during the meeting with Deniz Baykal, leader of Turkey's Republican People's Party, who is on an official visit to the TRNC, Denktas indicated that the Greek Cypriot side, which maintains the talks for merely tactical purposes, is playing a game by entering the EU [European Union]. Indicating that the TRNC side's entrance into the EU, in which Turkey is not a member, would mean "its integration with Greece," Denktas said: "This would mean a limitation of the guarantee agreements. We have already given our message to the world. By pursuing this injustice, that is, the south of Cyprus' joining the EU, they would be securing the complete integration of North Cyprus with Turkey. Then, that is how the Cyprus problem will be solved. We are now facing such a situation." Saying that despite all their goodwill they are still the accused side, Denktas hoped that the United Nations would retract its mistake. He said: "The United Nations has resorted to a method of forcing us either to accept a bad decision or face accusations and the Greek Cypriots' entrance into the EU. It has thus committed a great injustice. We hope they will realize this and correct it." In thanking Baykal for his keen interest in the Cyprus problem, Rauf Denktas said: "We want to see the leaders of the political parties in Turkey among us during the 20 July celebrations."
