Speaking to Russian and foreign journalists after the meeting, Andrey Kozyrev stressed that the conversation between the high-ranking guest from Israel and Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin which took place earlier covered a great many topics and touched on all aspects of bilateral relations and of the problems of a Near East settlement. "We can state that our relations are improving," the minister said. "They are developing in a positive, specific way both with regard the former and the latter range of issues. Russia has serious and long-term interests in the Near East; they spring from full-scale cooperation and partnership with Israel and the Arab states, and from providing maximum assistance to the Near East peace process as a co-sponsor of it." Summing up the results of the meetings already held, Yitzhaq Rabin noted that during the meetings he understood Russia's striving to continue assisting the establishment of peace and security in the Near East. Russia and the United States are helping the sides at the talks when it is requested of them, he pointed out. The Palestinians would like Moscow to help them in attaining certain aims, and we view this with understanding. The Israeli head of government spoke of the desire to develop broad contacts with Russia, particularly because they have been frozen for the last four decades. "Therefore, cooperation needs to be started virtually from scratch and not only in the areas on which agreements were signed yesterday," he said. He said that he has invited Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and also the speakers of both houses of the Russian parliament to visit Israel because "the bilateral dialogue should take place at the highest level." Yitzhaq Rabin said that he expressed profound gratitude to Boris Yeltsin for the fact that Russia granted its Jewish citizens the right to emigrate. "In all my meetings," he said, "I stressed that outbreaks of nationalism, neofascism, and neonazism can be seen in many countries. A careful watch must be kept on these processes." The prime minister also noted Russia's desire to assist in the release of Israeli prisoners-of-war seized at various times by the Arab side, and greeted with satisfaction Andrey Kozyrev's statement that Oleg Soskovets, a first deputy chairman of the Russian Government, who is visiting Syria, will raise this problem in talks with Syrian officials.
