Instead of lasting the 15 or 20 minutes which the director had agreed to grant ATGIMIMAS prior to our meeting, our conversation went on for almost an hour. He was interrupted several times by telephone calls: journalists from other publications wanting to meet with him... [passage omitted] [Visockas] Do you stay in touch with colleagues in Estonia and Latvia? Are your relations with Riga and Tallinn close, moderately close, or still rather distant? [Jurgelis] I have to confess that our ties are very meager. Our presidents spend time together, our prime ministers rub shoulders, our foreign ministries associate with each other, but as for us, well, unfortunately... Why? Stability is needed, but for the time being, there is no stability in the Lithuanian Department of Security. The most important reason for this is the turnover of chiefs of the security service. What kind of long-term cooperation can be established if our service is still only starting to establish itself? So this is one of the main reasons why there hasn't been a closer association with the colleagues from Riga and Tallinn, despite the fact that there are certainly common interests, such as the hostile activity of foreign countries, narcotics, weapons smuggling... [Visockas] Do you keep in touch with the Russian security service? Are the ties friendly? Are they necessary? [Jurgelis] Yes, they are necessary, if for no other reason than that Lithuania wants to get documents back--the files of people who previously worked in the Soviet KGB. A state commission, to which I also belong, has been formed, and a month ago, we sent a request to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to hand over those files to the Republic of Lithuania. We have not, however, received a reply thus far. Our cooperation with Russian security ought to begin when we get these files back. Getting these files back, as far as I know, is a concern of not only the Lithuanian security service. [Visockas] What should be the level of association with the security services of the Russian Federation? [Jurgelis] We need to make up our own minds on this. Let's say that Poland signed an agreement with Russia on cooperation in the areas of narcotics and weapons smuggling. This kind of cooperation has nothing in common with politics. [Visockas] How do you assess the performance of the institution which you head? [Jurgelis] I could only assign a very low grade. Our institution is still in the process of getting established. Indeed, none of the people whom M. Laurinkus brought along with him are still here. We are all newcomers. It is bad that our functions are not yet fully regulated by laws: Seimas has been deliberating a draft law on the security service for half a year now; last time barely ten minutes were allotted for deliberation of the draft; I had time to say only a few words and the members of Seimas managed to get in only a few responses... What we are especially lacking in our service are trained personnel, i.e. workers with a higher education who are sufficiently young and are able to think analytically. The prestige of the Lithuanian security service has fallen. There is no heavy influx of people; we don't have a large pool to select from. Low salaries, no doubt, are at fault for this. Very soon, security service workers will have to recertify, and we will have to let some less promising workers go. This may lead to something of a scandal in the public. On the other hand, though, this service holds promise for young, talented, patriotically disposed people. Salaries, too, will rise, and there will also be opportunities for training assignments abroad. Those who regard us as the incarnation of evil do so without foundation. [Visockas] The publishing house MINTIS has published a book, "The Secret Services of Lithuania: 1918-1940". Have you read it? [Jurgelis] This is the first book about Lithuania's secret services, so it should be popular. I had the opportunity to rub shoulders with A. Anusauskas, its author. But so far, I haven't had time to read the book carefully. [Visockas] You can't fit it in? [Jurgelis] That's correct, I can't. Those who know how to work have free time, but I could not yet count myself in their company. I am not yet able to organize my work in such a way that a few free hours remain each day. [Visockas] Did your relations to your family, friends, and acquaintances change when you became head of the security service? [Jurgelis] I associate with my family and my close friends in the same way that I did before. It seems, however, that relations with acquaintances have changed somewhat. Now, people sometimes look at me with suspicion, with a certain degree of distrust.
