FR940203-2-00126 FR940203-2-00068 Definitions_Skill Certificate Comment: One commenter believed that the definition of the term ``Skill certificate'' would impose a barrier for students with disabilities and would encourage their exclusion from States' School-to-Work Opportunities programs. The commenter suggested that the definition be changed to read, ``a portable, industry-recognized credential issued by a program that certifies that a student has mastered skills at levels that, to the extent feasible, are at least as challenging as the standards endorsed by the National Skill Standards Board.'' Discussion: As provided for in paragraph (b)(8) of the priority, under the School-to-Work Opportunities program, States are required to describe in their plans how they will ensure that students with disabilities will have opportunities to participate in the States' School-to-Work Opportunities programs. Under the ``Student Participation'' selection criterion, States are required to propose realistic strategies and programs to ensure that all students, including students with disabilities, have opportunities to participate in their States' School-to-Work Opportunities programs. The clause ``ensuring opportunities to participate'' is intended to include opportunities to achieve program outcomes, including a skill certificate. While it is very important that individuals with disabilities be provided with the necessary support to ensure that they have the opportunity to participate, the Secretaries do not see the need to modify the definition of the term ``Skill certificate'' to provide for different skill levels for students with disabilities, than those provided for students without disabilities. Changes: None. Definitions_State Comments: Five commenters noted that the term ``State'' is not defined in the notice. They suggested that, to avoid confusion, the term ``State'' should be defined as ``each of the several States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.'' Discussion: The applicable definition of the term ``State'' is contained in section 521(33) of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act, as implemented by ยง400.4(b) of the Perkins regulations. Changes: None. Definitions_Workplace Mentor Changes: None. Comment: One commenter suggested that the workplace mentor was a critical link within the School-to-Work Opportunities program and was likely to require special training in order to fulfill this role effectively. The commenter viewed the workplace mentor as being a pedagogue with technical knowledge of the employment areas of interest to the students participating in the program. The commenter felt that greater consideration should be given under this program to training of workplace mentors and that this could best be achieved under a separate grant program. Discussion: Under this priority, State and local partnerships may utilize implementation grant funds to train workplace mentors to ensure that they are knowledgeable in the employment areas that School-to-Work Opportunities students are engaged in and to ensure that the mentors have the necessary knowledge of the work-based curriculum as well as other program policies and practices. Because the Secretaries believe that partnerships should be able to customize programs to meet the needs of local communities, including those of employers and students, they do not believe that a separate grant program is necessary to providing the proper training for workplace mentors. Changes: None.
