FR940628-2-00006 FR940628-2-00003 The United States Department of the Interior's (USDI) recent statement of policy (Section 6.4.2 of the EIS) declares that IMP components 1&hyph;3 must first be conducted and proven ineffective before the USDI would initiate any components that would be conducted on NPS property and directed at relocating the Jamaica Bay laughing gull nesting colony away from its present location. Past experience with component 1&hyph;3 activities between 1991&hyph;93 indicates that these three components are effective in reducing bird-strikes at JFKIA. Decision The circumstances identified above require that the APHIS decision be bifurcated. 1 I will treat actions that must be taken in the near term separately from those that would be taken in the longer term. 1 Based on past experience, ADC determined that gulls are likely to create an extreme hazard to aviation before the close of the required 30-day period between issuance of the Notice of Availability of the Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and the decision. Thus, ADC requested a 16-day waiver of that time period (Appendix 1) from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). EPA granted the waiver in a letter dated April 29, 1994 (Appendix 2). Based upon the analysis contained in the environmental impact statement, I have determined that an integrated gull hazard control program at JFKIA is clearly superior. I have decided, in the context of the relationship between ADC and the Port Authority, that when ADC personnel determine, with the concurrence of the FAA and the Port Authority, that the number of gulls entering JFKIA airspace has reached an unacceptable level, ADC will begin an on-airport gull shooting program as described in Chapter 3 of the EIS, once the requisite Federal and New York State permits are issued to ADC. ADC will work with the Port Authority among others to enhance JFKIA's on-airport bird control program, improve the functioning of the Bird Hazard Task Force (BHTF), and reduce off-airport attractants. These non-lethal components will contribute to the reduction of gull mortality over the long term, but will not be as effective in achieving that objective as would be the relocation of the Jamaica Bay laughing gull nesting colony through conduct of IMP components 4&hyph;6. ADC believes such relocation is feasible and would be in the best interest of air travelers and the laughing gull population. Short-Term: I have determined that the IMP represents the best available means of addressing the expected immediate need to reduce the potential for large numbers of gull-aircraft collisions at JFKIA in 1994. When ADC personnel determine, with the concurrence of the FAA and the Port Authority, that the number of gulls entering JFKIA airspace has reached an unacceptable level, ADC will begin an on-airport gull shooting program as described in Chapter 3 of the EIS, once the requisite Federal and New York State permits are issued to ADC. Whenever possible, ADC will continue to assist the Port Authority in implementing and improving the nonlethal components of the IMP, including the conduct and enhancement of: On-airport vegetation, water, insect, and sanitation management programs, improved operational functioning of the Port Authority BCU and the BHTF, and, wherever possible, the identification and reduction of off-airport bird attractants. Conduct of these activities will minimize the number of gulls taken in the on-airport shooting program. The overriding factor that weighed in making this decision is human safety. Other considerations, including the minimization of adverse environmental impacts have been factored into this short-term decision to the fullest extent possible. Although I would have preferred a decision that included immediate efforts to relocate the laughing gull colony, the current circumstances do not favor those alternatives. Based upon past experience, the timing and nature of the gull-aircraft strike hazard will likely dictate that management action will be immediately necessary to protect human safety; other alternatives could not be fully implemented and still address this immediate need. Long-Term: APHIS ADC supports the implementation of the six components of the IMP, with the long-term objective of relocating the laughing gull colony away from its present location. For the long term, reducing the potential for gull-aircraft collisions at JFKIA should be achieved through the IMP, with emphasis on non-lethal alternatives and on those alternatives that would accomplish relocation of the Jamaica Bay laughing gull colony away from its present location. Conduct of the 6-component IMP provides a more complete opportunity to strike a balance between human safety and other public policies. The EIS adequately analyzes all alternatives, including those which APHIS and the State and Federal cooperating agencies would authorize. Although APHIS cannot authorize or pursue the alternatives that would occur on NPS property, it should be emphasized that the important factors of human safety and protection of wildlife can be achieved only through implementation of all components of the IMP. The nature and extent of APHIS' role in JFKIA's Gull Hazard Reduction Program will be examined annually by APHIS ADC, which will report its findings to me and make them available to the public. The Port Authority's efforts to conduct non-lethal gull control methods and USDI's progress towards the conduct of the components that would occur on NPS property will be among the most important factors APHIS will consider. To reiterate, the environmentally preferred long term approach is the relocation of the laughing gull colony away from its present location at the end of the runway, in order to reduce the long term mortality of gulls, and so substantially reduce the potential for gull-aircraft collisions at JFKIA. Minimizing Environmental Harm The primary adverse environmental impact of the gull hazard reduction program is the mortality of gulls. The continued development and conduct of the Port Authority's on-airport program that emphasizes non-lethal bird hazard control approaches, will contribute to the reduction of gull mortality. Conduct of the three IMP components that would occur on NPS property would reduce the need to conduct on-airport shooting programs, and would reduce over the long-term the mortality rate of gulls. The Port Authority and the USDI are encouraged to conduct these activities in order to reduce gull mortality in the short and long terms. Chapter 7 of the FEIS identifies mitigation and monitoring strategies to be conducted to minimize the adverse impacts of alternatives. All APHIS-conducted gull hazard control activities will be conducted in such a manner that minimizes adverse environmental impacts and seeks to maximize human and aircraft safety at JFK. During the course of the shooting program, APHIS ADC will monitor the situation at the airport, including mitigation strategies, and report periodically (at least bi-weekly) to me. All such reports will be available to the public. Dated May 25, 1994. Lonnie King, Acting Administrator, USDA, APHIS.
