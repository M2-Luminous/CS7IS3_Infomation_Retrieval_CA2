FR940303-1-00009 FR940303-1-00003 ``Undercover Investigation'' Second, the section now includes a definition of the term ``undercover investigation.'' Under this definition, the hallmark of an ``undercover operation'' is an investigation in which an individual ``whose identity as an official of the government or a person acting at the behest thereof is concealed or is intended to be concealed.'' This definition is intended to be read broadly to include virtually every type of law enforcement investigation in which the identity of a government employee, or the fact that an individual is cooperating with the government, is concealed. Section 77.3␣Represented Party; Represented Person This section differs significantly from the corresponding section in the earlier proposal in order more closely to follow the language in DR 7&hyph;104(a)(1) and Rule 4.2, which establish general prohibitions against ex parte contacts with a represented party, and to differentiate between those individuals who are represented by counsel and have become a party to a proceeding, and those represented individuals who are not parties to any relevant proceedings. An individual is considered to be a ``represented party'' under these rules if: (1) The person is represented by counsel; (2) the representation is current and concerns the subject matter in question; and (3) the person has either been arrested or charged in a federal criminal case or is a defendant in a civil law enforcement proceeding concerning the subject matter of the representation. If the person is currently represented in fact regarding the subject matter in question, but has not been charged or arrested, that person is considered a ``represented person.'' Thus, witnesses, suspects and targets of investigations who have not been indicted or arrested are considered represented persons under this rule and in the United States Attorneys' Manual guidelines. Section 77.5 of this rule generally prohibits government attorneys from initiating ex parte contacts with represented parties, but does not prohibit ex parte contacts with represented persons. (However, §§77.8 and 77.9 prohibit some contacts with represented persons as well.) This distinction between represented parties and represented persons is consistent with the rulings of the vast majority of federal courts to consider the issue. See United States v. Infelise , 773 F. Supp. 93, 95 n.3 (N.D. Ill. 1991) (DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) ``speaks in terms of communications with a `party', suggesting that the rule is to be applied only when adversarial proceedings have been initiated.''); United States v. Ryans , 903 F.2d 731, 739 (10th Cir.) (``We are not convinced that the language of [DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1)] calls for its application to the investigative phase of law enforcement'' because ``the rule appears to contemplate an adversarial relationship between litigants, whether in a criminal or a civil setting.''), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 855 (1990); United States v. Dobbs , 711 F.2d 84, 86 (8th Cir. 1983) (agent's ``noncustodial interview of [suspect] prior to the initiation of judicial proceedings against the appellant did not constitute an ethical breach''); United States v. Kenny , 645 F.2d 1323, 1339 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 452 U.S. 920 (1981); United States v. Lemonakis , 485 F.2d 941, 956 (D.C. Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 415 U.S. 989 (1974); In re U.S. Dept. of Justice Antitrust Investigation , 1992&hyph;2 Trade Cases (CCH) ¶ 69,933, at 68,469 (D. Minn. 1992) (Rule 4.2 held inapplicable because ``[t]he word `parties' in Rule 4.2 indicates the presence of a lawsuit'' and ``[t]he present controversy relates to an investigation, not a lawsuit''); United States v. Western Electric Co., Inc ., 1990&hyph;2 Trade Cases (CCH) ¶ 69,148, at 64,314 & n.6 (D.D.C. 1990); United States v. Guerrerio , 675 F. Supp. 1430, 1438 (S.D.N.Y. 1987); Faragher v. National R.R. Passenger Corp ., 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1810 at *2&hyph;3 (E.D. Pa. 1992). Only the Second Circuit has suggested that DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) may apply to federal law enforcement activities before indictment or arrest. See United States v. Hammad , 858 F.2d 834, 838&hyph;39 (2d Cir. 1988); United States v. Pinto , 850 F.2d 927, 935 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 867 (1988); United States v. Sam Goody, Inc. , 518 F. Supp. 1223, 1224&hyph;25 n.3 (E.D.N.Y. 1981), appeal dismissed, 675 F.2d 17 (2d Cir. 1982). Section 77.4␣Constitutional and Other Limitations This section is substantially similar to the corresponding section in the earlier proposal. The section has been revised slightly to make clear that although the proposed rule does not supersede the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, this limitation does not extend to other rules regarding procedure in federal courts. Thus, rules of procedure adopted by individual courts as local rules, many of which incorporate state bar rules, are not included in this limitation. Section 77.5␣General Rule for Civil and Criminal Enforcement; Represented Parties This section, as well as sections 77.6 through 77.9, differs substantially from corresponding sections contained in the earlier proposal. This section closely tracks the language of DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) and Rule 4.2 and applies similar prohibitions to attorneys for the government. The section prohibits an attorney for the government from communicating with a represented party, as defined in §77.3, about the subject matter of the representation without the consent of that individual's attorney. The prohibition applies, however, only if the attorney for the government knows that the represented party is, in fact, represented by counsel. Therefore, communications by an attorney for the government with a represented party will not violate this rule if the attorney for the government is unaware of the fact of representation. This section also prohibits an attorney for the government from causing another individual to communicate with a represented party. Accordingly, a government investigator acting at the attorney's direction and control may not do what the attorney himself or herself is prohibited from doing. Conversely, a government attorney will not be personally responsible for the actions of agents in communicating with represented persons unless, in doing so, the agents were acting as the attorney's ``alter ego.''
