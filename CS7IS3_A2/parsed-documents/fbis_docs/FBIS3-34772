In an interview with IRNA the source added that the decision was taken at a meeting between al-'Attiyah and the visiting Nigerian Petroleum and Mineral Resources Secretary Chief Don Obot Etiebet in Doha on Wednesday. Etiebet is on a tour of OPEC member countries to shore up support for production cut and price boost. Without the cooperation of OPEC member countries in cutting production a price hike would be impossible, said the source.
