But then how can we explain the fact that in August 1991 you were an active defender of the White House? [Govorukhin] What is so surprising about this--both in 1991 and now I defended and continue to defend the constitution and democracy. How do you explain that in 1991 our president acted in the name of defending constitutional foundations (he took an oath of allegiance to the people on this very constitution), while in September 1993 the constitution was essentially trampled! Now, this logic definitely defies explanation! [Kotlyar] You probably remember that it was said way back in the "500 Days" Program that "black" money is capable of facilitating the accumulation of productive capital; then there were contentions that any initial accumulation of capital is good, and the sooner it "accumulates," the better; now the president gets horrifying analytical reports saying that crime is almost beginning to displace the state! A federal crime suppression program is adopted, with an envisaged cost of 2 trillion rubles [R]. So what do we have: First we seem to urge those guys to accumulate money, in order to subsequently put it to work, by any means possible; then we start crying: "Help! We are surrounded by robbers!"? [Govorukhin] As early as the 1980's we, members of the cultural establishment, warned the government that flirting with the criminal world would end badly. I wrote a lot about this, and my film "We Cannot Live This Way Anymore!" is a graphic teaching aid for the powers that be! That crime will flourish if it is encouraged was no secret to anyone. It is a different matter that the current authorities are artificially creating favorable conditions for bringing as many people as possible, from different societal strata, into the criminal vortex. It turns out that it also makes sense politically: Once you get dirty, you have no choice but to support the authority that lets you live this way. This is why at all elections the criminal underworld actively supports the current regime. By creating economic oppression, the authority itself pushes people in the direction of "black business," machinations, buying-reselling, embezzlement, and thus in a way creates direct dependency on these conditions. The criminalization of society is underway. One can see the same in the military and the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs]. Can you imagine the soldiers of the 1991 army firing at the Supreme Soviet of Russia? Now, however--you have seen it for yourself! The military has been put into extremely difficult economic circumstances; it is becoming demoralized, corrupted, and losing its moral foundations. Fight crime in these conditions? Nonsense! We cannot stop crime through the legal system! First, we have to change the socioeconomic nature of our life. For instance, the law on taxes. It should be profitable to work! It should be promising and attractive to produce goods. Loan-sharking, on the other hand, robbing the population through the banks, stealing state materials, and selling off military equipment should be not just unprofitable but outright criminal, dangerous! That is, we have to cut the economic roots of crime. As long as a young person sees in the experience of people around him, his own parents, that it is impossible to live honestly, the ranks of criminals will keep getting new recruits from the younger generation. And the second, no less important item--creating a moral climate that opposes criminal morality. The spirit of society is predicated on the level of culture, on art. These are the most effective levers of educational impact on the inner world of a person, his formation. The church--yes! But the beneficial influence of the goodness of the church shows up gradually, being absorbed over several generations. This we will see in the children that have not yet been born. Right now, what do we have--people come to church in droves, while criminals keep multiplying, ignoring everything, and occasionally even robbing temples! Only the spirituality of books, theater, cinema, and museums are capable today of attracting people, bringing out of their hearts an impulse for moral revival. To achieve this we have to restore libraries to their proper place, subsidize theaters and production of our films--fundamentally change the moral atmosphere; only then will the code of legal norms really begin to work! After all, it is not that difficult to get rid of street crime if needed. In this respect Zhirinovskiy is right--two weeks of tough law enforcement on the city streets, and the problem will go away. It is simply that right now nobody wants to do this. As well as making the punishment commensurate with the crime committed. For instance, you steal a hen and get eight years, but you steal a car somebody had been saving for all his life, and you get two years of probation! It is important to correct all this, but only after the main two causes are liquidated. [Kotlyar] Stanislav Sergeyevich, now that you are a deputy and can observe from inside the law-making mechanism, how do you explain that laws on corruption and organized crime still have not been adopted; that the notions of "leader" and "organizer" have not been defined? Without these legal norms the militia is practically toothless. [Govorukhin] You reason the same way as the MVD! This is not the point. Of course, we need laws, and the law on corruption has already been drafted and will be passed; however, without uprooting socioeconomic roots this will have no effect on the final outcome. Tell me, what keeps the militia from getting rid of street crime today? The lack of a law on corruption? [Kotlyar] We frequently ask this question and hear in reply: We do not have enough personnel, we are being sidetracked into maintaining law and order during manifestations... [Govorukhin] How many times a year does this happen? Six thousand people gather on national holidays. Is this really the reason? The reason is different: the military and the militia are being readied for suppression of all sorts of public unrest. This is happening in the regions under the guise of protection of borders, suppression of large-scale crime. [Kotlyar] In your book "The Great Criminal Revolution" there is this thought: A country that has betrayed its elderly does not have a future. That is, the generation that won the war, that built everything that still supports our life, has found itself essentially struck out of life and doomed. In the name of what? In your opinion, can this be corrected? [Govorukhin] This is precisely the moral atmosphere I am talking about. We have rejected the elderly, the keepers of popular wisdom and morality, people who have been revered at all times. Among other peoples the notion of an elder is a symbol of respect. The leadership should be comprised of people who understand well what they are doing and what responsibility they have to the history of the country. Take cinematography. This is where perestroyka actually began. Like a drop reflects the sea, this small cell of society reflects all the consequences to come of the mistakes that have been made: The system of movie distribution--the best in the world--has been destroyed; the elders of the profession, who brought world fame to national cinematography, have been relegated to the trash heap; state support for production of Russian films has been removed; and what did we get--ruin! Cinematography is not a country--everything happens fast there. But was it not possible to draw correct conclusions from the initial stage of the experiment? No, they continued along this road, and as a result the entire country, its entire industry and agriculture, have been destroyed... [Kotlyar] Stanislav Sergeyevich, prominent politicians believe that the "Chinese way" is unsuitable for Russia... [Govorukhin] Well, but you see, they all play tennis! Remember Dostoyevskiy: Smerdyukov could not imagine restructuring Russia without the Germans and the French. Our rulers are the same way; they have forgotten our own history and literature; they do not remember that from time immemorial the Russian eagle has been looking to the West and to the East, picking the best in different parts of the world. [Kotlyar] And at the same time, it is laughable, but one can find examples in the press that when they want to show the good side of capitalism, they say that China and Turkey have fed and clothed Russia in no time at all! Meanwhile, the trade routes from Turkey and the ill-starred China are littered with young victims. Is it possible to return this generation to a normal life cycle? [Govorukhin] This is a lost generation. We cannot pin any hopes on it! They will not go to work in production, will not defend the motherland, and of course will not want to dig into the hard rock of science. They have been poisoned by the venom of profit. A school of a young tribe of thieves. Children who wash cars instead of learning. The usual argument--what is wrong in this, let them learn how to work at a young age! Why do not let children of big bureaucrats and nouveaux riches wash cars? It is the children from impoverished families that stay uneducated and quickly become criminalized. When a father is asked to come to the school because his son is failing a grade, he just shrugs: What can I do, I am unable to feed the family. Children from well-to-do families will go to prestigious lyceums, get a foreign education. The city of Zabaykalsk. By night children rob railcars, and by day they work as rickshaws for Chinese merchants. I saw these children--they are happy to have what they have. They simply do not know that there can be a different life... This is what has been done to the young generation. And this is the worst. Not the plundered mineral resources--this is bad, but we can survive it, ours is a rich country; a future destroyed, however, cannot be replaced! The substance of reforms, for the sake of which we have sacrificed our children, is that in the 1990's inflationary processes in the West abated dramatically, and business activities picked up. Western economists write that about $30 billion flows there annually and work for Western capital. It is rubbish that the West feeds Russia. John Ross puts it straight: It is the exhausted Russia that feeds the well-to-do West. Due to diminished internal consumption, Russia exports more fuel and raw materials... From my own observations--Kentavr, a Chita company, signed a contract with a Chinese company to sell KamAZes. One KamAZ--one tonne of chewing gum! Nineteen trucks for 19 tonnes of chewing gum! Here is a principle for you. The more unprofitable the contract is for the state, the greater the income "on the side!" The result: Several hundred thousands dollars landed in the Chita company's foreign bank account. An enormous crime against the state is being committed! [Kotlyar] You voted for the amnesty. The law enforcement organs maintain that many of those serving time for grave crimes will fall under the formal provisions of the amnesty. [Govorukhin] Quite possibly. This is not the State Duma's initiative, however, but the president's. His draft edict on amnesty covered only criminals. How can one start living by a new constitution by issuing an edict freeing criminals when the country is in such a situation? The State Duma added a political amnesty so that people would see that there are people among deputies who understand very well and make proper judgments of events. As it had been under unbridled Bolshevism, the authority draws its strength from the criminal strata and seeks support and understanding among them. The result: People tiredly reject everything that is going on. I meet with people and I hear them express horror over what happened during the days of October 1993; they also want to know more about the new apostle--Zhirinovskiy. [Kotlyar] By the way, what is your opinion of him? [Govorukhin] If you listen to him, he is an ardent fighter against the current authority. In reality, however, he is Yeltsin's man. He supported all edicts, the new constitution--it would not have passed without his support! He is now a very convenient lightning rod to scare the people: You say we are bad, and maybe it is so, but look! This is what you will get if we go! A day does not go by without the mass media portraying time and again "Zhirinovskiy's horrors." The authority cannot survive without an enemy. And who is the enemy today? Khasbulatov, who is sitting in Chechnya? Rutskoy, just released from prison? Zhirinovskiy fits perfectly the leading part of "enemy of the authority and the people." He is a very sophisticated and adroit politician. [Kotlyar] Who do you see as the leader of Russia? [Govorukhin] There are many such people! The most important thing for each of them is to be a sincere and convinced democrat, a man of great culture and fine intuition, a man who loves his people without reservation and is loyal to them. Not a few fuehrer! [Kotlyar] But every time there is a turn in history the possibility of a fuehrer cannot be dismissed. [Govorukhin] Everything is possible. But one can hardly imagine anything worse than what we have now. [Kotlyar] Right now you have to work in the State Duma on collective decisions together with your opponents; how do you feel being next to your colleagues in the deputy corps from the opposing camp? [Govorukhin] I do not understand the mentality of these people; it is alien to me, and I do not try to find a common language with them. [Kotlyar] Do you think that the State Duma has a future? [Govorukhin] No. It has no authority. It is being discredited; washing dirty linen in public--a lot of that is done. A demonstration for the people--what a collection of never-do-gooders and loafers it is. The history of the Supreme Soviet is being repeated. That one was disbanded to popular applause. Now there will be a presidential edict to disband another parliament, and everybody will say: This is great! It is important to convince the people that Russia does not need a parliament at all! [Kotlyar] Why did you go there then? [Govorukhin] I realized that this would be a powerless body, but I could not imagine that it would also be completely mute. There is no opportunity to appear on television, to publish in newspapers. Only now has a small window opened. People, however, want to talk to us. Take, for instance, my book "The Great Criminal Revolution"--a million copies sold, in our times! You cannot find it anymore. Dozens of regional newspapers reprinted it in its entirety. I get swamped with questions, but it is very difficult to find a forum where I can reach broad audiences. [Kotlyar] What do you think of Kazannik in this recent incident involving his resignation? [Govorukhin] I think he is too naive a person, but undoubtedly a man of integrity. [Kotlyar] And about Rutskoy's trust contract? [Govorukhin] Rutskoy was dangerous while he was in prison; now the task is to discredit him as quickly as possible. This case will be dusted off, although nothing can be proven there. But if it cannot be proven, what happens then--will the new procurator be held responsible? Hence, they will use all angles, will again investigate the Revival Foundation, the Agrokhim, and so on. I have said this many times already. [Kotlyar] Are you currently making a new movie, writing a new book, or playing in a movie? [Govorukhin] I have produced a video film with the same title as the book, and am working on a new expanded edition, which will be translated into several languages. [Kotlyar] Thank you for answering the newspaper's questions.
