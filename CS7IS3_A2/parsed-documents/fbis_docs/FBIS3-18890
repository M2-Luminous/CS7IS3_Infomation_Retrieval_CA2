The full extent of the willingness of other countries to contribute extra forces to peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslavia would become clear within 24 to 48 hours, he said. "Two or three countries have already indicated a very positive response which we welcome," said Mr Rifkind. "We will know over the next 24 to 48 hours at most whether it is a small number of contributors or a wide range." Mr Rifkind was speaking after Sir David Hannay, British Ambassador to the United Nations, chaired the first of a series of meetings in New York to discuss an urgent UN plea for 10,650 more men to join the peacekeepers. The British initiative will bring the 19 countries -- mostly from Europe but including the United States and Argentina -- together for a second informal meeting tomorrow. Mr Rifkind said agreements around Sarajevo, the Croat-Muslim ceasefire in central Bosnia and the Serb agreement to reopen Tuzla airport were significant changes for the good. "What we may be seeing is a creeping ceasefire," he said. "These changes do represent something quite important and a valuable window of opportunity that could lead towards peace in Bosnia." He stressed: "We are anxious that this opportunity should not be missed. We think it is important that all countries that can make an important contribution should, and do so to the maximum extent they can." Mr Rifkind said it would not be right for him to identify those "two or three" countries willing to contribute. But they are understood to include Turkey, which has so far been prohibited from taking part in peacekeeping operations in Bosnia because of its extensive historical links with the region, which it ruled for centuries under the Ottoman Empire. But officials hope to persuade UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to lift the ban, particularly as Russia -- traditional allies with the Serbs -- plans to send more forces. Britain is ready to send a second infantry battalion based on The Duke of Wellington's Regiment from Tidworth, Wilts., which is equipped with 72 Saxon armoured vehicles. The British UN force commander in Bosnia, Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, has warned that ceasefires could collapse unless more troops were sent to police front lines. Mr Rifkind said: "We have indicated our willingness to play our part. I think there will be a lot of thought being given in national capitals today. ``If events of the past few weeks should continue and there is an opportunity for achieving peace in Bosnia then the UN and member countries will want to play their part in maximising this opportunity in bringing it to a satisfactory conclusion.''
