FR940203-2-00015 FR940203-2-00009 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [Docket No. 940119&hyph;4019; I.D. 123093G] Coral and Coral Reefs of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Notice of control date for entry into the commercial fishery for live rock. SUMMARY: This notice announces that anyone entering the commercial fishery for live rock in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off the coastal states of the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico after February 3, 1994 may not be assured of future access to the fishery if a management regime is developed and implemented under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. ) that limits the number of participants in the fishery. This notice is intended to discourage new entries into the fishery based on economic speculation while the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Councils (Councils) consider fishery management options that range from limited access to a total prohibition of live rock harvest. ADDRESSES: A copy of draft Amendment 2 to the Fishery Management Plan for Coral and Coral Reefs of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic may be obtained from the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic may be obtained from the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council, Lincoln Center, suite 331, 5401 West Kennedy Boulevard, Tampa, Florida 33609&hyph;2468, or the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council, Southpark Building, Suite 306, 1 Southpark Circle, Charleston, South Carolina 29407&hyph;4699. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Georgia Cranmore, 813&hyph;893&hyph;3161. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Councils are developing Amendment 2 to the Fishery Management Plan for Coral and Coral Reefs of the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic (FMP) that would add ``live rock'' to the fishery management unit. Live rock means certain living marine organisms, or an assemblage thereof, attached to a hard substrate (including dead coral or rock). In addition to live corals, these organisms may include anemones, sponges, tube worms, mollusks, crustaceans, bryozoans, sea squirts, and marine algae. Management measures adopted could include harvest limitations, such as limited entry or a total prohibition of harvest to prevent fishery habitat loss, a provision for aquaculture of live rock, and permits for scientific and educational collections. In 1989, the Florida Department of Natural Resources (FDNR) (now Department of Environmental Protection) determined that live rock harvest (i.e., the collection of rocks with marine organisms attached for use in home aquariums) was detrimental to the Florida Reef Tract and other hard bottom habitat areas. The Florida Marine Fisheries Commission (FMFC) noted that the only current net production of the carbonate substrate underlying live rock occurs on living rock reefs and, in Florida, these areas are either in equilibrium or eroding. FDNR personnel testified that more than 90 percent of the live rock examined at the request of enforcement agents contained visible colonies of prohibited corals, such as stony corals and sea fans. The FMFC concluded that live rock removal (1) can violate State and Federal laws that prohibit taking of corals, (2) reduces the surface area and topographic complexity of Florida's coral reefs and other live bottom areas, and (3) removes entire micro-communities along with targeted aquarium species. As a result of this rulemaking, live rock harvesting efforts shifted to the EEZ off Florida. The FMFC has noted that in 1991 approximately 35 individuals reported combined landings of about 300 tons of live rock from EEZ waters adjacent to the Florida Reef Tract, Florida's east coast reefs, and the Gulf of Mexico hard bottom areas. In 1992, reported Florida landings from the EEZ totalled about 400 tons.
