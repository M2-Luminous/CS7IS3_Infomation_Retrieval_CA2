[Sobrinho] I do not know. It could be a rumor, spread by people with interests in the area or by ill-informed individuals. What we cannot deny is that the MST is starting to have a war image, which is not real and which does not help the struggle for agrarian reform. They make a lot of noise and obtain poor results. It is a case of "too much potato and too little meat." [Lacerda] Do you think the MST is the appropriate channel for achieving agrarian reform? [Sobrinho] No. The MST is one of the instruments. What I criticize in this movement, and what I try to tell our fellow peasants, is that the agrarian reform is not the responsibility of a single entity. I do not question MST's good intentions, but the movement has adopted policies characterized by imposition, bureaucracy, and state ownership. If we are not careful, the MST will end up as a paternalistic movement, considering itself to be the sole representative of agrarian reform. We have already seen conflicts in expropriated areas on the issue of land ownership. Does the land belong to workers or to the MST? I am not supporting capitalism as a solution, but it is necessary to find a middle ground. [Lacerda] But the MST has helped landless people, has it not? [Sobrinho] Sometimes they act in radical ways and end up losing the people's support for causes that are absolutely just. Landless peasants often invade unproductive areas or land owned by people who are indebted to the state. [Lacerda] What else do you condemn in the MST? [Sobrinho] First I want to make clear that I believe the MST is doing an important job. But I am worried about the movements' narrow views. Agrarian reform does not mean simply conquering the land. Our experience shows that most people who have benefited from a piece of land abandon their lots if they have the tools to work them. This occurs because landless peasants are led to believe that all their problems will end when they settle on a new piece of land. Things are quite different in real life. [Lacerda] What do you think is needed, then? [Sobrinho] Peasants occupying a piece of land need to eat until their land starts producing. They need medical care. They need to learn how to read, and credit to start cultivating. I think they need a comprehensive program with the support of many entities and groups until they can stand on their own two legs. [Lacerda] Are landless peasants prepared to produce? [Sobrinho] Most of them are not. It is not their fault that they lack preparation. People from the northeastern forest zones, for instance, became used to factory salaries. Workers' unions are not doing anything to prepare these people to become farmers. [Lacerda] Do you believe an agrarian reform encompassing all those aspects is viable? [Sobrinho] Yes. It is arduous, but a true agrarian reform will require a lot of work. Those who think that an agrarian reform can be implemented only through the installation of a socialist state are completely wrong. Besides, the right as well as the left agree on the need for change in land ownership policies. I think there is lack of government political willingness, on one hand, as well as lack of planning and reasoning by those organizing and struggling with workers and landless peasants.
