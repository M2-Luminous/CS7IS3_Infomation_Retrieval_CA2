FR940728-1-00049 FR940728-1-00014 Multiplying the hours spent by the average hourly wage of all reviewers ($19.56), direct labor costs for reviewing ATFI filings in a given year were calculated to be $821,520. Adding the indirect cost factor (99.50 percent), fully distributed cost for filings are about $1,639,000. To arrive at a per-filing cost, the fully distributed cost is divided by the estimated number of filings (approximately 5,500,000), giving a per-filing cost of $0.29. Since the Commission pays a contractor for maintaining the ATFI system, the allocation of the contractor cost to each tariff filing is appropriate. Contractor data show that the total time the system is used annually is approximately 1,753,958 minutes, while industry use of the system for filing totals 451,203 minutes, or 25.72 percent of total system time used. The remaining time was used mostly by the Commission staff and by retrievers of data. Using this factor, the portion of the contractor cost ($1,100,000) allocated to filing is $282,920 ($1,338,514 × 25.72 percent). Allocating the $282,920 across the 5,500,000 9 filings gives a per-filing system cost of approximately $0.05. The per-filing system cost is added to the $0.29 per-filing cost to derive a total cost of $0.34 per filing. 9 This figure includes tariff filings and ET filings. As mentioned, the Commission was able to distinguish ETs from the other filings. Since ETs are similar in nature from one contract to the next and are in text format, processing time for the most part remains constant over time. It takes, on average, five minutes to review a typical ET filing. Again using the average hourly wage for reviewers, the direct labor cost for processing an ET filing is $1.62. Summing the direct labor cost and the indirect cost factor (99.50 percent), the fully distributed cost for processing an ET filing is $3.24. Adding the system charge of $0.05, the fully distributed cost comes to $3.29 per filing. In keeping with OMB Circular A&hyph;25, the Commission intends to update its fees on an annual basis. In updating its fees, the Commission will incorporate changes in wages and salaries of its employees into direct labor costs associated with its services, and recalculate its indirect costs (overhead) based on current level costs. The Commission certifies pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, including small businesses, small organizational units and small government jurisdictions. The Commission recognizes that the proposed fees may have some impact on the shipping industry, but not of the magnitude that would be contrary to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. For the most part, entities impacted by the proposed increases are ocean common carriers who traditionally have not been viewed as small entities. Moreover, the Commission grants a waiver of the detailed reporting requirements to carriers which earn gross revenues of $25 million or less in a particular trade in accordance with 46 CFR 552.2(e). Furthermore, Commission regulations provide for waiver of fees for those entities that can make the required showing of undue hardship. OMB review is not required because this proposed rule does not contain any collection of information requirements as defined by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, as amended.
