Municipal workers, however, have arrived at the Municipal Palace building and are staging protests outside. They have said they will support any measure decided on by the United Workers Front [FUT] and labor organizations. In Quito, demonstrations and clashes between the National Police and workers and students are slowly gaining strength, specifically in the Theater Plaza near the Ecuadoran Federation of Classist Organizations headquarters where some labor leaders are protesting. The protest is gaining momentum in nearby areas. People are blocking traffic in the El Tejar tunnels. Students and workers are sporadically gathering, and when they are dispersed, they gather somewhere else to continue their protests. There is absolutely no transportation in downtown Quito. There is no means of transportation in the historic part of the city. Taxis have disappeared. In the [word indistinct] area, where buses were circulating, they have disappeared given the growing demonstrations. This is where the bus drivers union, the Pichincha Drivers Union, is located. It has also been attacked by people who are protesting. Diverse sectors have rejected the transportation sector's attitude, which has not joined the strike. In the historic part of the city, the strike is all encompassing. We can observe hundreds of people walking through the historic part of the capital. Businesses and banks have closed their doors due to protests and clashes between the police and workers. Also, people cannot go about their daily business activities. We were able to contact Roberto Paz, government under secretary and president of the National Traffic Council, who made statements assessing what has taken place in this strike by the FUT. According to the government spokesperson, everything is normal throughout the country. [Begin recording] [Paz] Reports we have indicate that the disturbances are under control, especially in the [word indistinct] and the places where students are present. [Unidentified reporter] Have there been clashes? [Paz] No, there have not been any clashes with the police, according to reports we have received. We hope there will not be any either. We urge the strikers to conduct the strike in a calm manner to prevent further disruptions. [words indistinct]
