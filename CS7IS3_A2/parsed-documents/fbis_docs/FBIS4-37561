Which side do you think he will blame for his mission's failure? [Muhammad] First of all, I would like to thank Cairo radio for its concern and attention to the events in Yemen and its objective reporting of the news. I also wish to thank His Excellency President Husni Mubarak for his concern for Yemen's security and stability. I believe it is still possible to contain the Yemeni crisis and that Brahimi's role has not ended yet. I believe he should continue his good offices. He will need help from the Arab League, the United Nations, the Arabs, and other concerned parties. Brahimi's mission is a worthy one. We hope his efforts will prove successful. [Riyad] Mr. Muhammad, we know that you are in touch with all Yemeni parties. You have said that the possibility of ending the crisis still exists. However, the issue has gone before the UN Security Council for a second time. Does this mean it has reached a new, critical stage? [Muhammad] At first, we hoped that the crisis would be handled among the Yemeni leaders themselves. I said earlier that the crisis should have been handled in a domestic context. We also hoped that the cooperation of the brothers in the region and the Arab League would help to settle the conflict. Regrettably the situation escalated and became more complicated. Speaking on Cairo radio at the beginning of the crisis, I warned of this escalation and said it would produce infighting and secession. The crisis has moved from the domestic Yemeni sphere to an Arab one and finally to the international sphere. Nevertheless we still hope that the UN secretary general and the Security Council will help Yemen to contain the conflict, stop the bloodshed, and bring stability and security to the country. [Riyad] Mr. Muhammad, your remarks make me wish to ask you about the roles played by the Arab League and the fraternal Arab countries that are really concerned with Yemeni stability. Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has asserted that the Yemeni crisis is not the responsibility of the world community alone but of the Arab world as well. 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, member of the Yemeni Presidential Council, has said, however, that he wants the issue to remain in the hands of the Yemeni themselves. He remarked that if foreign intervention stops, the Yemenis will be able to solve their problems more easily through dialogue. He noted that there had been nine months of dialogue before military actions began. [Muhammad] 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani expresses his own viewpoint. I actually agree with him that the crisis was a purely Yemeni affair at the beginning. I stressed this several times, emphasizing that a solution should be found at home by the Yemeni leaders themselves. It is now known, however, that the crisis has moved from the domestic sphere to a regional sphere, to the Arab League, and finally to the United Nations. We would like our brothers and friends to cooperate with the Yemeni leaders to contain the conflict, reach a cease-fire, and restore dialogue to spare the Yemeni people further losses and tragedies. [Riyad] Mr. Muhammad, do you believe that if Lakhdar Brahimi returns to the region, his mission will succeed? [Muhammad] We wish him success but this requires sincere cooperation from the warring parties. I want to declare over Cairo radio that the problem is political and the solution must be political. Guns and missiles must fall silent. I said this from the beginning and called for a political solution. I believe that all the parties must offer concessions to make a solution possible. In fact, I am in touch with all Yemeni parties. I and some sincere people are seeking to help the Yemeni leaders and brothers to contain the conflict. I have some proposals that I hope will succeed, with some assistance from good people in Yemen and our brothers and friends abroad. [Riyad] Have you submitted these proposals? [Muhammad] I am continuing my contacts and consultations with all the parties concerned with the Yemeni crisis. [Riyad] Mr. Muhammad, former south Yemeni president, thank you. [Muhammad] Thank you.
