Hata, while appealing to SDP to remain within the coalition, warned that he will form a new cabinet even without the SDP, the biggest party in the alliance. He had this to say, "we cannot spend so much time" on this matter. SDP quit the coalition earlier today, in a move that deprived the coalition of its parliamentary majority, leaving the new prime minister crippled at the start of his administration and the country facing the prospect of possible early elections. The SDP decision of pullout was approved formally at an emergency meeting of the party's central executive committee. At the meeting SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama attacked the sudden formation last night of a new parliamentary bloc grouping the coalition's centrist and conservative parties but excluding the SDP, saying it destroyed the coalition structure. The SDP holds 74 seats in the 511-member lower house. Beside the 130 lawmakers already committed to the new bloc, the centrist Komeito (Clean Government Party) is reportedly ready to bring in its 52 members as well. Against this, the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) holds 206 seats.
