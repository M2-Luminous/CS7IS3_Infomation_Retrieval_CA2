Yoshio Utsumi, director general of the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry's International Affairs Department, made the comment while briefing foreign reporters on Japan's position on the matter. An official at the department confirmed the content of Utsumi's remarks at the briefing but said they were not as strong as had been reported. AP-DOW JONES NEWS SERVICE reported that Utsumi warned that Motorola Inc.'s business in Japan could suffer if the company and the U.S. Government picked an "unnecessary" fight about the need for immediate results. The ministry official said the tone of the U.S. wire service's report was too strong. "He (Utsumi) did not make such a warning. That story seems a little strong," the official said. The U.S. Government said earlier this week it plans to impose sanctions against Japan for violating a 1989 bilateral cellular telephone agreement. The agreement paved the way for Motorola to offer cellular telephones in the densely populated corridor between Tokyo and Nagoya on the basis of its own system. Japanese officials say Tokyo has fulfilled its responsibilities to abide by the agreement, but the U.S. side complains that implementation of the agreement has effectively discriminated against Motorola.
