It is further ordered, Pursuant to section 5a(a)(12)(A) of the Act and based upon the Commission action in the three preceding paragraphs of this Order, that the CCC's and ICC's request for Commission approval of their proposal to establish a CCC&hyph;ICC&hyph;OCC cross-margining program for proprietary and market professional accounts and approval of the related proposed rules and rule amendments is hereby granted.
