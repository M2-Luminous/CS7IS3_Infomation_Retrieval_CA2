The project that Pioneer is going to join decided to develop and use its own regulations as a world standard in the summer of 1993. Because of this decision, Pioneer, a non-European company, was able to join the project. The Eureka 147 project is promoting DAB via digital transmission which makes it possible to receive signals even by a mobile media. DAB will start in 1995. Pioneer which was permitted to join the project as the first non-European company said, ``by being able to participate in this project, production of experimental devices for broadcasting will become possible.'' Pioneer will provide DAB experimental receivers to DRRI (Digital Radio Research Inc.) in the beginning of 1995. The experimental broadcasting is planned to start in Canada in the beginning of 1994 using a transmitter developed in Europe. The reason why the Eureka 147 project opened the door to non-European companies seems to be that the project aims at world standardization. In the past, it was said that the specifications regarding OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex) for modulation ``had never been disclosed to technical people in Japan.'' This sudden change is perceived as a way to establish a world standard which will enable Japanese makers to manufacture the receivers. Three Kinds Of Modes According To Frequency Bands Table 1 shows the DAB regulation that Europe is suggesting to ITU-RS (old: CCIR). OFDM used for modulation is digital transmission using intersecting multiple carrier waves. Depending on the carrier waves in frequency bands, three modes are set. Mode I is terrestrial broadcasting, mode II is terrestrial and satellite broadcasting, and mode III assumes use for satellite broadcasting. All three modes have 1.5 MHz frequency band width. Most characteristic for OFDM is that it is not significantly influenced by multipath distortion caused by objects such as mountains and buildings. The development of a mobile receiver for audio and video is getting quite active. Allowable hours of multipath change depending on the mode. Since terrestrial broadcasting will be most susceptible to multipath interference, mode I has the longest allowable hours. Depending on the allowable delay hours, the duration of the guard interval (during the period of 1 symbol, the period at the time of demodulation is ignored) which avoids interference between symbols also varies. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.
