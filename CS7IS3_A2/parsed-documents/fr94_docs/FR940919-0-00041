SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On March 5, 1990, POP Fasteners (POP), a division of Black and Decker Corporation, of Shelton, Connecticut petitioned the Agency under §§260.20 and 260.22, to exclude from hazardous waste control its F006 metal hydroxide filter cake resulting from the treatment of wastewater originating from its electroplating operation. After evaluating the petition, EPA published its final decision in the Federal Register (57 FR 57673, December 7, 1992) to exclude POP's waste from the lists of hazardous waste contained at §§261.31 and 261.32. POP's final exclusion only applied to the process and waste volume (a maximum of 300 cubic yards generated annually) covered by its original petition. Any waste generated in excess of 300 cubic yards per year must be handled as hazardous unless an amendment to POP's final exclusion is granted.
