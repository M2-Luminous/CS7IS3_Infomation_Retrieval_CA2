Kuchma and V. Hrynyov Are Preparing a Party"] [Text] On 15 March, the attention of journalists became focused on a well-known organization, which has been particularly active on the eve of the elections: The Interregional Bloc of Reforms [MBR]. A news conference of the MBR cochairmen Leonid Kuchma and Volodymyr Hrynyov was held in the lecture-hall of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. According to them, a few days ago, at the second regional MBR conference in Dnipropetrovsk, 389 out of 500 representatives of 23 Ukrainian oblasts joined the bloc, and V. Hrynyov and L. Kuchma signed an appeal to the people of Ukraine calling upon them to attend the elections and, of course, give support to the candidates of the MBR. "If, on 27 March, you do not come to the elections, this will mean that you do not want changes. If you do not come to the elections, the policy, which has placed the people on the verge of extinction, will continue. If you do not come to the elections, that would mean that you deserve your present standard of living. We call upon you to say, on 27 March, "no" to the isolationist and adventurist policy and "no" to the collapse of the economy and to the impoverishment of the people. We call upon you to say "yes" to Ukraine's future!" reads the appeal. At the beginning, as expected, the program, goals, and principles of the MBR were discussed and, toward the end, the personality of L. Kuchma was "dealt with." Many people were, for example, surprised to read the article on the need to grant equal status to the Ukrainian and Russian languages in Ukraine. However, the two cochairmen of the MBR look upon this problem in a quite simple and calm manner: Why should we argue about such "petty matters" now that the economy is nearing total collapse? In the opinion of the MBR, contacts with Russia must be restored, and Ukraine must become a full member of the economic CIS union. "We are convinced that Russia and Ukraine must become strategic partners and allies," said Hrynyov. The MBR also considers combating crime to be one of its future tasks. According to the MBR, the method of struggle is simple. "All power must be concentrated within a single center," said L. Kuchma. L. Kuchma's explanation of the so-called Crimean issue was quite interesting: "If the wages in the Crimea is $21 and in Russia -- $81, the striving of the Crimeans is clear and understandable. It is necessary to grant more freedom to regions, but this does not mean that it is necessary to create 25 Crimeas in Ukraine." Hrynyov, for example, believes that there must be free economic zones, but not many of them. "I do not think that people will refer to a good place as a "zone" [prison camp]," said L. Kuchma. "If we create a zone, the rest of the oblasts will do everything to have such a zone fail." L. Kuchma sees a solution to the Black Sea Fleet problem in leasing it, together with the infrastructure, to Russia, but doing as like normal civilized countries do -- on terms advantageous for ourselves. The MBR leaders are in no hurry to propose themselves as candidates for the post of Ukrainian president. In V. Hrynyov's opinion, it is, first, necessary to create a stable faction in the parliament, since a future president, if he wants to work successfully, must gain the support of the overwhelming majority of the population and of a parliamentary majority. The MBR leaders plan, in the case of a favorable alignment of forces in the parliament, to transform the MBR into a regular political party. However this, according to them, will be decided at the third conference, which will be held shortly after the elections. At present, L. Kuchma is going to tour Ukraine's electoral districts in order to win over votes for his bloc.
