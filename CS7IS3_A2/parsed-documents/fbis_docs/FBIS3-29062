Ministry officials said that additional construction of nuclear power plants in South Korea is inevitable, but that recognition of the situation and knowledge of nuclear reactors among the general public are inadequate. In a plan to enhance such recognition and knowledge, the Ministry will send 210 people in 17 observation parties to overseas power plants this year, compared to 65 in eight parties last year. The Ministry plans to construct 76 power plants including 14 nuclear plants by 2006 to meet the demand for power, which is expected to increase by more than 10 percent yearly into the early 21st century. The plan will raise the proportion of nuclear power in electricity generation to 47.7 percent in 2006 from the current 40.3 percent, Ministry officials explained.
