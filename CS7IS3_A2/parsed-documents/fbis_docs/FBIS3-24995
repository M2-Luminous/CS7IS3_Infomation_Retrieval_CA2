An authoritative source told AFP that "it is the best solution," adding that the appointment of Boubacar Keita, former minister of foreign affairs, "should cool tempers." The new prime minister offers certain guarantees to both camps -- the ADEMA big shots and President Alpha Konare -- which have been been flying at each other for several months now. The former camp wants a "powerful government" and the latter is criticized for its April 1993 choice of Prime Minister Abdoulaye Sekou Sow, who represented the civil society. As a founding member of the executive committee, ADEMA's highest political organ, the 49-year-old Keita is a "man of the fold," as the party's radical wing was demanding. However, he is also a trusted aide of the head of state, and was the deputy director of his presidential campaign, and then his spokesman after the 1992 elections. ADEMA's leaders who intend to "govern alone" will be reassured by the fact that Aboubacar Keita is a "politician." They will interpret his appointment as "a step by the president toward the party," an authoritative source in Dakar told AFP. Immediately after his appointment, Aboubacar Keita hurried to reappoint the government of his predecessor with the sole exception that Mrs. Sy Khadiatou Sow, member of ADEMA and currently governor of Bamako region, succeeded him as minister of foreign affairs. This decision has been interpreted as a gesture made to reassure the other parties in government that Mali cannot entertain a new political crisis, less than two years after Alpha Konare's accession to power. Today, the leaders of the presidential group affirm that "basically, there was no reason" to ignite another ministerial reshuffle, three months after the previous one which was marked by the strengthening of the presence of radical members of ADEMA. The abrupt departure of Abdoulaye Sekou Sow, who on 2 February presented the fait accompli "because he felt abandoned by all," according to his aides, did not permit the president "to push his analysis further."
