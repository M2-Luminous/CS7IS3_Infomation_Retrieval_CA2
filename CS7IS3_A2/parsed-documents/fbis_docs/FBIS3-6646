"We are not an impoverished country which needs part of another country," Alatas said here on Friday. East Timor Province is geographically part of Timor Island, while another part of it belongs to East Nusa Tenggara Province. In 1975, East Timorese issued a declaration, the so called Balibo Declaration to express their desire to integrate with the Indonesian nation. One year later, East Timor integrated with Indonesia, making it the country's 27th and youngest province. "It's impossible for a country which has 17 thousand islands to look for additional island," he said. The 23 Portuguese arrived here on Thursday night for a one-month long visit in the country in what many saw as a family reunion. Upon their arrival at Sukarno-Hatta Airport, they were welcomed by Fransisco Xavier Lopez Da Cruz, a respected senior East Timorese politician and Indonesia's ambassador at large for East Timor affairs, and a number of activists of the Indonesia-Portugal Friendship Association (PPIP). According to the plan, they will visit Yogyakarta and Salatiga, two cities in Central Java where many East Timorese youths study, on Saturday, afterwards they will proceed their trip to Denpasar, Kupang, and Dili. Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana, the daughter of President Suharto who chairs the PPIP said the visit was aimed at meeting with their relatives whom they had separated each other for tens of years. [sentence as received] She expressed the hope that the visit would help expedite the solution of East Timor question through a number of international fora under the auspice of the United Nations. It was the common people who would suffer the most if the East Timor question remained unsettled, she said. The visit is a follow-up to the historic meeting in London between East Timorese leaders in East Timor and those living in exile last December. Lopez said the participants at the London meeting agreed that goodwill should be promoted and this visit is a manifestation of the goal set at the meeting. The one-month long visit was merely socio-cultural in nature and there was not another motive behind it, Lopez said. In the meantime, Alatas also expressed his hope that the 23 Portuguese of East Timorese descent would be free to visit various places in Indonesia.
