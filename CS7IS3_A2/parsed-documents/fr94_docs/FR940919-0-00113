See the write up of the waste minimization results for more details. i. Organic TC Wastes As described above, EPA conducted a facility specific cost analysis for those facilities managing organic TC waste. The incremental costs for the TC wastes, presented in Exhibit XVI&hyph;1, are between $191 and $216 million per year. Sixty-seven percent of the total cost, in the upper bound, is for the treatment of organic TC nonwastewaters, and 16 percent and 17 percent is for the treatment of organic TC contaminated soil and debris, respectively. ii. Other Newly Regulated Wastes Since current management practices show that no coke by-product wastes are landfilled, as a result of the coke by-product listing rule (August 18, 1992, at 57 FR 37284), EPA estimates that there are no cost impacts associated with the treatment standards for coke by-product wastes. The incremental cost for chlorinated toluenes is estimated to be less than $0.1 million annually. iii. Testing, Recordkeeping, Permit Modification Costs The analysis of the testing requirements in today's rule estimates incremental costs of approximately $3 million per year. The costs for the recordkeeping requirements were estimated to be approximately $490,000 per year. These costs are described in more detail in the Regulatory Impact Analysis background document developed for today's rule, which has been placed in the Agency's docket. c. Waste Minimization
