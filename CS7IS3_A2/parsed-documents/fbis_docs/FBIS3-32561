The governments of Brazil and Germany are concerned about the Senate's position, which could markedly undermine the visit Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim will make to Bonn late this month. The main items on the agenda of Brazilian-German relations -- including technological cooperation to be implemented by the private sector -- now depends on the position of the Brazilian Government on the subject of nonproliferation of nuclear technology. In Bonn, the seat of the German Government, there exists the conviction that the overall credibility of the German foreign policy -- especially in the eyes of its western counterparts -- would be jeopardized if it does not discontinue every form of cooperation on advanced technology with Brazil should the Brazilian Senate fail to ratify two treaties: One containing amendments to the Tlatelolco Treaty (which bans nuclear weapons in Latin America and establishes controls) and a quadripartite agreement signed by Brazil, Argentina, the (Vienna-based) International Atomic Energy Agency, and by the recently created joint Brazilian-Argentine agency (which establishes comprehensive inspections and controls on nuclear activities by the two countries, which are described as "full scope safeguards." [given in English]) German laws require that the Brazilian-German nuclear agreement signed in June 1976 be renounced, regardless of which party is in the government at the end of this year (general elections are scheduled for 16 October). Through this agreement, Brazil gained access to various stages of the nuclear fuel cycle, in addition to obtaining technological transfer and to reaching a commitment to build two large nuclear reactors (Angra-2 and Angra-3). The German Government cannot cooperate with a country which is not a signatory of the Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) -- which is the case of Brazil -- or which has not agreed to another international control regime. Unless it is rescinded by either of the two parties, the agreement will be automatically renewed at the end of 1994 for another five years. To maintain its credibility, the German Government is prepared to go as far as shouldering the financial consequences of reneging the contracts to build the Angra-2 plant, which is guaranteed by the Hermes insurance company (that is, German taxpayers may lose hundreds of millions of marks). There is adequate parliamentary support for the government to take such a decisive course of action. An influential group of Social Democratic deputies has been campaigning since last year to get the nuclear agreement renounced on the grounds that Brazil has failed to join the NPT and that it refuses to submit its activities to international inspection. Most conservative deputies of the ruling German party (the Christian Democratic Union) firmly believe that "if the price to pay to secure a permanent seat for Germany on the UN Security Council is to support irresponsible countries like Brazil or Nigeria, it would be a very high price to pay," as a leading spokesman for the Christian Democratic bloc recently put it to a ranking Brazilian counterpart in Bonn. The German reaction to the Brazilian Senate's behavior has been unanimously conveyed by several German circles, the private sector included. "Brazil will not receive a single screw from Germany if the Senate fails to ratify these treaties," is a widely repeated phrase. The campaign on the nuclear issue has already had an impact on other sectors: A visit to Germany scheduled for February by a Brazilian delegation has been canceled without clear explanations. This delegation was to have studied the impact of Brazil's proclaimed decision to join the Missile Technology Control Regime (its English acronym is MTCR) on Brazilian-German space exploration projects, which is being partially implemented by a subsidiary of Daimler-Benz. According to a high-placed source in Bonn, Siemens executives have also voiced concern about the fact that the Brazilian Senate is provoking a situation which in practice will preclude any advanced technology transfer to Brazil. Brazil is on the "H list" (from which Argentina has just been excluded), which forces any German exporter or supplier of sensitive technology item to Brazil to obtain special authorizations before concluding any deal. It has been stated in Bonn that if the Senate fails to accept international controls on Brazilian nuclear programs, the above requirement would also be applied to projects such as the transfer of technology for building conventional submarines. Yet, if the Senate ratifies these agreements, the German Government would be willing to consider building a nuclear powered submarine -- a major project of the Brazilian Navy -- as "a borderline case" not explicitly banned by the Tlatelolco Treaty or by the quadripartite treaty. This project may thus be continued. There has been wide speculation and conjectures in Bonn about the existence of "skeletons in the closets" of the military; that is, about whether international inspection teams may yet find undisclosed atomic projects in Brazil. The German Government speculates as to whether the reasons behind nonratification is prompted by the Brazilian Senate's failure to understand that this is a far-reaching subject that it has many implications, or whether there are "other motives" for its reluctance to agree to the international inspections. In official and unofficial remarks, German officials have noted, however, that they have no indication to conclude that Brazil is running undisclosed parallel atomic programs. The German Government is both perplexed and scared by Brazil. It has been openly contended here that a few powerful people are hurting the interests of the Brazilian nation in the name of "things of the past and of outdated positions," an argument that is often used to refer to the Brazilian Senate. Officially, the German Government is not supporting any country in the reorganization and (expansion) process of the UN Security Council. Informally, however, it is known that Bonn would support Brazil at the United Nations. Yet, this will fundamentally depend now on the nuclear issue. German perplexity does not stem from the behavior of the legislature -- which is marred by corruption scandals -- alone but also from that of the executive branch. In Bonn, no one knows for sure whether the construction of Angra-2 will be completed. Wishing to conclude the project, the Germans have expressed desire to supply additional credit and even to finance Brazilian counterpart funds (nearly $750 million), arguing that it would be cheaper to complete the 1,300 megawatt plant now than to cancel the entire project. It is not known, however, what President Itamar Franco will decide. In 1978, Franco presided in the Senate a congressional investigating committee on the Brazilian-German nuclear agreement. Another problem that scares many people in Germany is the fact that Brazil is having difficulties in obtaining agreement with the IMF, a condition for reaching an agreement with the Paris Club, which encompasses all of Brazilian governmental creditors. Germany is the main trade partner of Brazil within the European Union and it is the second leading investor of risk capital in Brazil, second only to the United States. The German Government is thus concerned about the constitutional revision because it believes foreign investors in Brazil are treated differently from or worse than domestic investors. It has been noted in Bonn that German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel touched on all these topics during his visit to Brasilia in October. The Brazilian foreign minister's visit, which seeks to strengthen German-Brazilian relations, which was described as strategic for both countries (during the Geisel administration) could be seriously undermined if the Senate does not change its position. It is feared that Amorim may come to Bonn only to hear complaints, without being able to give any kind of explanation.
