In a communique, the ministry praised the mediating efforts of the special United Nations envoy and of neighboring countries and expressed the hope that the Nairobi accords "will facilitate the rapid re-establishment of conditions of greater trust and agreement" and "institutional solutions" that may keep Somalia united. Italy will remain present in Somalia through its diplomatic seat and its development aid efforts and will take part in the country's reconstruction process, "as soon as conditions allow," said the ministry. The agreement calls for "voluntary disarmament" and a national reconciliation conference in May to elect a president. It also repudiates all forms of violence as a means of resolving conflicts and calls for a meeting of Somali factions in Mogadishu on April 15 to set up rules and procedures for voting and criteria for participation in the reconciliation conference. The reconciliation conference will allegedly elect a president, vice president and prime minister for Somalia. [passage omitted]
