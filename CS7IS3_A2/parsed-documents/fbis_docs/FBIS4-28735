The Socialist Republic of Vietnam, through its embassy here, held the Khmer Rouge guerrillas accountable for the massacre. The Embassy's open letter, received here recently, said an armed group of the Khmer Rouge stopped the fishing boat belonging to Le Van Tuong, 80, and his son Le Van Thanh, 20, who were claimed to have lived here for a very long time. The guerrillas were reported to have abducted the two Vietnamese and beaten them to death on the heads with rowing oars. The dead bodies were found afloat in the river recently by the bereaved family who were searching for the missing members, according to the Embassy. The Embassy has criticised the local police for delaying further investigation when informed by a representative of the Vietnamese immigrants. The Embassy also said another four Vietnamese residents were missing recently and their names and whereabouts have not been verified yet. The Vietnamese government looks forward to assistance from the Royal Government in investigating and taking effective measures to prevent the recurrence of the incident. As far as illegal immigration is concerned a number of newspapers here strongly condemned the Vietnamese government for what they call encouraging Vietnamese migration to this country, while the Royal Government has not been able to tackle the problems of mismanagement and loose administrations within the concerned authorities. The newspaper SAKOL recently said "the influx of Vietnamese immigrants into this country reveals the long-term objective of the late communist hardliner `Ho Chi Minh' who wished to annex and swallow Cambodia two decades ago". "There are new Vietnamese squatters at Chrang Chamres, near Monivong Bridge, who cannot speak a word in the Khmer language," the paper reported. The paper accused the Royal Government of being indifferent to the increasing number of illegal immigrants. However, the Royal Government has managed to resolve some of these immigration problems. Reports from Takeo Province said about 50 armed Vietnamese people have agreed to withdraw from Boreicholasa District where they came from and did farming without the knowledge or permission of the host district governor. Previously, they illegally encroached on the nation's territory 70 metres deep and 1,500 metres long for rice farming. After several rounds of negotiations, the two governors of Takeo-Cambodia and An Giang-Vietnam finally reached a solution. It should be noted that the National Assembly has already adopted the Immigration Law but the implementation is rather slow.
