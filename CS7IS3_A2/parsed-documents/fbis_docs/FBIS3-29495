Tsutomu Tanaka, administrative vice minister at the Economic Planning Agency, told reporters that the yen's latest advance against the dollar is somewhat excessive in light of economic fundamentals in Japan and the United States. "I'm concerned that this level will linger and do damage to economic recovery," he noted. The dollar finished at 104.57 yen in Tokyo Friday, up 1.09 yen from Thursday's close but still far below the 110 yen level seen before the weekend Japan-U.S. summit in Washington.
