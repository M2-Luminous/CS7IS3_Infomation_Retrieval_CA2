ACTION: Notice of a finding of no significant impact. SUMMARY: Pursuant to Section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969; the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations (40 CFR Part 1500); and the Soil Conservation Service Regulations (7 CFR Part 650); the Soil Conservation Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, gives notice that an environmental impact statement is not being prepared for the Asaayi Lake Watershed. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Humberto Hernandez, State Conservationist, Soil Conservation Service, 3003 North Central Avenue, Suite 800, Phoenix, Arizona, 85012. Telephone: (602) 280&hyph;8808. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The environmental assessment of this federally assisted action indicates that the project will not cause significant local, regional, or national impacts on the environment. As a result of these findings, Humberto Hernandez, State Conservationist, has determined that the preparation and review of an environmental impact statement are not needed for this project. The project proposes a combination of land treatment and structural practices to reduce erosion and the resulting sedimentation into Asaayi Lake. This action will extend the useful life of the lake from 15 years to 43 years. The land treatment includes planned grazing systems, grazing management, and proper grazing use. Also included are forest road obliteration, fencing, livestock pipeline, range seeding, brush management, and rangeland water spreaders. Structural measures include sediment and flood control structures, grade control and bank stabilization structures, improved recreational facilities, an irrigation water delivery system and 15 pools for improved fish habitat. The Notice of a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) has been forwarded to the Environmental Protection Agency and to various Federal, State, and local agencies and interested parties. A limited number of copies of the FONSI are available to fill single copy requests at the above address. Basic data developed during the environmental assessment are on file and may be reviewed by contacting Mike Sullivan, Assistant State Conservationist for Water Resources, at (602) 280&hyph;8787. No administrative action on implementation of the proposal will be taken until 30 days after the date of this publication in the Federal Register . (This activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under NO. 10.904, Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention, and is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.)
