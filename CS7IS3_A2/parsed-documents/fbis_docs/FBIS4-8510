We had very long and strenuous negotiations in the past 48 hours, Churkin stated, stressing that he had traveled between Pale and Sarajevo three times. Churkin singled out as positive the fact that the region of Gorazde is more peaceful. He added that he has received assurances from the leadership of the Bosnian Serbs that no offensive actions will be continued in this area. In return the Serbs expect adequate confirmation by the other side, Churkin said. "Apart from that, as regards the continuation of fighting in other areas, what we are going to do and what we can do here in Sarajevo is not to talk about Gorazde alone, but rather about the situation in general," the Russian envoy said. The ultimate aim of all activities is, he said, a political agreement, and he asssessed that there are no special opportunities for success unless all sides realize that without mutual cooperation and cooperation with the international community there can be no political agreement or normalization of relations in this area. "When I say normalization, I am thinking here of the lifting of sanctions and the return of Yugoslavia to normal international life," Churkin added. He pointed out that he made to President Karadzic "some specific proposals which include placing the warring sides under control" and that "the implementation of these initiatives on the ground could ensure stability in this area."
