The full text of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's answers were carried by the Cuban publication. The full text of his answers reads as follows: [Kim Il-song] I appreciate your congratulations on my birthday and welcome your visit to our country. Hoping you will achieve a new success in your just communication and information business, I will answer your questions. [PRENSA LATINA] The United States and the South Korean authorities are straining the situation by insisting that the DPRK has nuclear facilities to produce nuclear weapons. What is your country's position regarding this? [Kim] We built nuclear facilities with our own strength and technology to further strengthen the country's energy base. Our nuclear activities are every inch peaceful. We have reiterated on many occasions that we have neither the will nor the ability to develop nuclear weapons. We do not need to develop nuclear weapons and, even if we make one or two nuclear weapons, they are of no use [solsa handugaeui haengmugirul mandundaeya kugosun amu soyongdo opsumnida]. The Government of our Republic has invariably made efforts to realize the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula originated from the United States' bringing of nuclear weapons into South Korea. The United States occupied South Korea, a strategic point, and brought large-scale nuclear weapons into South Korea to realize its aggressive Asia-Pacific strategy opposing our Republic. Under the condition created in recent years, in which the Cold War ended internationally and North and South Korea adopted an agreement on nonaggression and the Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, the United States has lost the justification for retaining nuclear weapons and its aggression army in South Korea. Since then, the United States has tried to find a ruse to keep occupying South Korea and has deliberately strained the situation on the Korean peninsula by crying over the fictitious nuclear suspicion on us aimed at crushing [apsal] our Republic. The South Korean authorities are also frenzied in the new war provocation maneuver, following the U.S. nuclear commotion. The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula must be resolved through dialogue between us and the United States since it originated in the hostile U.S. policy against Korea. The United States also recognized [injong] that the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula should be settled by the DPRK and the United States, and acceded to DPRK-U.S. talks last year. The joint statement that the DPRK and the United States announced at the talks after reaching an agreement clearly stipulates that the United States should not pose nuclear threats against us, that both countries should respect each other's sovereignty and should not interfere in domestic affairs, and that they support the peaceful reunification of Korea. The United States, however, is persistently adhering to the anti-Republic maneuver even after the announcement of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement. The United States has driven the situation of our country to an extreme one [kuktanuro moragago issumyo] by overturning the agreement with us and rupturing DPRK-U.S. talks, and is maneuvering to pressure us by even mobilizing international organizations. Pressure cannot be a method to resolve the issue. If one thinks that one can bring our people, who regard sovereignty as their life, to one's knee with pressure and strong-arm tactics, it is a miscalculation. If the United States continues adhering to commotions of pressure against our Republic, we cannot but take due defensive steps in order to defend the nation's dignity and sovereignty. It is our consistent position to resolve the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula through dialogue. If the United States sincerely wants to resolve the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula, it should discard the international anti-Republic pressure commotions and come to DPRK-U.S. talks with a sincere attitude. Whether the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula can be resolved peacefully or not totally depends on the U.S. attitude. Besides, international organizations should not follow the unjust demands of big nations but should do what is helpful to a solution of the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula by keeping the principle of justice and fairness. [PRENSA LATINA] What are the bases of the foreign policies of the DPRK and how are its relations with neighboring countries, including China, developing? [Kim] The foreign policy of our Republic is based on the ideal of independence, peace, and friendship. The ideal of independence, peace, and friendship is a just ideal reflecting the common aspirations and desire of our people and the progressive people of the world to build a new, independent, peaceful, and friendly world against various dominations and subjugations. Based on this ideal, the government of our Republic is actively making efforts to develop friendship and cooperative relations with socialist countries and nonaligned countries. It concluded good neighbor relations with capitalist countries that respect our nation's sovereignty, and is developing economic and cultural exchanges with these countries. In particular, the government of our Republic pays deep attention to developing relations with our neighboring countries in a good manner. The relations between nations cannot develop in a good manner with the effort of only one side. Among our neighboring countries, there are nations that have good relations with our country while others do not. The relations between our country and China are good. The two countries of DPRK and China are neighbors with a river in between, and the Korean and Chinese people are close and friendly [chingunhan] comrades-in-arms and brothers who are struggling for a common cause. The people of the DPRK and China have fought firmly hand-in-hand and by shedding blood against the imperialists. They supported and closely cooperated with each other in the struggle for socialism. The traditional DPRK-PRC friendship is continually developing in all domains -- political, economic and cultural -- thanks to joint efforts of the parties, governments and peoples of the two countries. Japan is also our neighboring country. However, normal relations have not been achieved between the DPRK and Japan. The Japanese Government implemented hostile policies against our country in the past. Recently it is disturbing a solution to the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula by taking part in the United States' anti- Republic maneuvers, and is attempting to pursue its insidious political and military purposes. If the situation on the Korean peninsula is aggravated and an unexpected state [puluiui satae] is formed, it will not be good for Japan, either. The Japanese Government should look at the reality and act with discretion. [PRENSA LATINA] As a socialist country, what policy is the DPRK adopting concerning foreign countries' investment in its territory? [Kim] It is the consistent policy of our Republic's government to expand and develop economic and technological exchanges with various world countries on the basis of building a self-reliant national economy. In accordance with the further development of our self- reliant socialist economy on the basis of modern technology, our foreign economic relations, too, will expand and develop in various forms such as joint ventures and collaboration as well as trade. This is of help to our economic building, and is also compatible with the progressing tendency of international economic cooperation. We have enacted and promulgated relevant laws, including the Foreigners Investment Law, with a view to encouraging foreign investors to make investments within the boundary [yongyok] of the Republic, protecting their investments, and to guaranteeing their legitimate rights and interests on the basis of complete equality and reciprocity. As is already widely known, we have proclaimed the Najin-Sonbong District a free economic trade zone, and have been providing a more favorable environment and conditions for foreign investments in this zone. Because of its vast economic potential and favorable natural, geographical conditions, the Najin-Sonbong free economic trade zone, which is located on the border area of Korea, China, and Russia, is attracting great interest from foreign investors, and there are many countries hoping to invest in this zone. If foreign investors make investments in the Najin-Sonbong Free Economic Trade Zone, this will greatly contribute to expanding and developing the regional economic cooperation and the economic and technological exchanges among various world countries. The government of our Republic is always opening doors of investment to foreign investors. [PRENSA LATINA] What do you think of the prospect for Korea's reunification? [Kim] The division of our nation imposed by outside forces has been continuing for nearly half a century. It is the supreme task of the nation--which cannot be put off even for a moment--to end the tragedy of the national division and realize the reunification of the fatherland. Our party and the government of the Republic are making all efforts to realize by all means [ottokehana] the historic cause of the reunification of the fatherland in the nineties. We put forth the 10-point program for the grand unity of the whole nation for the fatherland's reunification last year. The 10-point program for the grand unity of the whole nation reflects the unanimous desire of all Korean compatriots in the North, the South, and abroad who wish to realize the nation's reunification and prosperity by firmly uniting as one while transcending the differences in ideologies, ideas, and systems. We have hoped that the people in the South Korean authority come out on the path to reconciliation and cooperation by responding to our 10-point program for the grand unity of the whole nation. This notwithstanding, turning their face away from the whole nation's desire for reunification, they have been traversing the road to dependence on outside forces and to confrontation between the North and South. The present regime in South Korea is a flunkeyist, nation-selling one which is following the outside forces in a thorough way. Due to the maneuvers of opposing reunification and provoking a new war by the people in authority in South Korea, there lay a grave obstacle and difficulties on the road before our people aspiring to the fatherland's reunification. But, we are optimistic about the prospect of the fatherland's reunification. Our nation is a homogeneous one with a long history of 5,000 years. No force can divide our nation into two forever. The fatherland's reunification is a unanimous wish and a vital demand of the whole nation. Those running counter to this are only a tiny fraction of the flunkyist, nation-selling force. It is inevitable for a nation, which has artificially been divided by outside forces, to be reunified into one. The forces aspiring for reunification will surely overwhelm and be victorious over the splittist forces. We have already put forth the most reasonable method for the fatherland's reunification, too. The method for the fatherland's reunification in the form of a confederal system based on one nation, one state, two systems, and two governments--we have put forth--is a just and realistic way for reunification which can help realize the country's reunification in an above-board manner, in an independent and peaceful way, and in the quickest fashion,--while one neither swallows up, nor is swallowed up [mokgona mokiujianko] by another--under the circumstances in which different ideologies and systems exist in the North and South of Korea. The formula for fatherland reunification based on a confederal system foresees our country developing into a neutral state without becoming a satellite state of another country or joining in any political and military alliance or bloc after our fatherland is reunified. For this reason, this complies with the earnest desire of our neighboring countries and the peace-loving countries of the world. As long as all fellow countrymen unanimously yearn for the reunification of the fatherland and as long as we have the most fair and aboveboard and realistic proposal for fatherland reunification, the historic cause of the fatherland's reunification will be achieved without fail. At this opportunity, I express my deep appreciation to the Cuban party, government, and people for always positively supporting our people's cause of the fatherland's reunification. [PRENSA LATINA] How do you assess the relations between your country and Cuba, and how do you recall your meeting with Comrade Fidel Castro Ruz. [Kim] Though Korea and Cuba are far apart with an ocean and a continent in between, the friendly ties between the people of the two countries are close like neighbors. The friendship between the people of our two countries is militant friendship between class brothers who oppose imperialism and struggle for victory in the socialist cause and a genuine and solid friendship based on revolutionary principle and comradely loyalty. The friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries have been developing on a new high stage since we and Comrade Fidel Castro met. I still emotionally recall our meeting with Comrade Fidel Castro in 1986 in Pyongyang. At that time, we had our historic first meeting that we had looked forward to for a long time and talked and conversed in a comradely atmosphere. The leaders of our two countries discussed the issue of further expanding and developing friendly and cooperative relations between Korea and Cuba and various other matters of mutual concern, reached a consensus of views on all issues under discussion, and further consolidated our intimate relations. Comrade Fidel Castro's visit to our country left an unforgettable impression on our people. Comrade Fidel Castro's visit to our country was followed by unanticipated complicated events in the international arena. However, the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries are continuously developing according to the spirit, which was agreed on during the meeting between the leaders of the two countries, without shaking even in the vortex of history which determines the destiny of socialism. The Cuban people are heroic people who are solidly defending the socialist post in the Western Hemisphere under difficult circumstances in which the imperialists are continuously maneuvering to isolate and crush [korip apsal] them. Our people highly assess the fraternal Cuban people for the fact that they are excellently carrying out strategic tasks in a special time in a peaceful period [pyonghwa sigiui tukpyol sigi] after strongly uniting around the Communist Party of Cuba led by Comrade Fidel Castro, the outstanding leader of the Cuban revolution, and extend full support for and firm solidarity with them. Further expanding and developing friendly and cooperative relations between Korea and Cuba is the common desire of the people of the two countries, and marching under the uplifted banner of socialism in our two countries would greatly contribute to defending and maintaining the socialist cause and carrying out the cause of independence for mankind. The Korean people will also in the future make every effort to develop the friendly and cooperative relations with the fraternal Cuban people. I convey my friendly greetings to the fraternal Cuban people and sincerely wish that the Cuban people will bring about greater achievements in their struggle to defend the independence and sovereignty of the country and build socialism.
