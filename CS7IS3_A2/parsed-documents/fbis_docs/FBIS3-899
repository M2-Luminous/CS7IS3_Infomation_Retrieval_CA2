The striking workers are accusing the government of trying to transfer EPA workers into another department without having made any prior arrangements. According to the unions, the authorities' decision stems from a promise made to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to keep salary commitments at the current level of 42 billion CFA francs. For two months now, the EPA personnel expenses have allegedly been charged to Chapter 21 of the national budget, which is on subsidies, and not to Chapter 11, which is on salaries. In the unions' view, this is likely to make the EPA personnel's salary situation precarious in the long run. The state could gradually transfer salary costs to the departments which employ them. For several months now, the authorities have been saying that the rearrangement is purely technical. It should be pointed out that they have decided to increase salaries by 15 percent, 10 percent of which will be paid as of 1 April and 5 percent in October. In Bamako, FM transmissions on Radio France International and Africa No. 1 were interrupted due to the strike, which has also affected all the major hospitals in Bamako and its surroundings.
