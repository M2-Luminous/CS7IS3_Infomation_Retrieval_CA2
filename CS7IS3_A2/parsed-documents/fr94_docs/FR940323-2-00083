SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Program Background and Objectives The specific goal of the Healthy Start Initiative_Special Projects is to significantly reduce in two years high infant mortality rates in rural or urban designated project areas through accelerated implemention of innovative strategies. Therefore, it is expected that the programs will incorporate the principles of innovation, community commitment, and personal responsibility and, in doing so, improve access to care. To accomplish this goal, prospective applicants must have an established consortium which has a minimum of two years experience with planning and implementation of infant mortality strategies, including an extensive public information campaign. In addition, applicants must have the capacity and willingness to develop a management information system to track project interventions and to participate in an extensive national evaluation with currently funded Healthy Start projects. Finally, Federal Healthy Start Initiative_Special Projects grant funds may only be used to supplement, and not to supplant or replace, either existing State or local funds, or State or local funds that would otherwise be made available to the project. Eligible Project Areas Areas targeted under the Healthy Start Initiative_Special Projects are those in which infant mortality problems are most severe, resources can be concentrated, implementation is manageable, and progress can be measured. A project area is defined as one which is composed of one or more contiguous geographic areas or neighborhoods for which improvements have been planned and are being implemented with the principles of: Innovation, community commitment and involvement, increased access, service integration, and personal responsibility. Project areas must represent a reasonable and logical catchment area in which a consortium for delivering services is already operational, and for which infant mortality reduction strategies are already designed.
