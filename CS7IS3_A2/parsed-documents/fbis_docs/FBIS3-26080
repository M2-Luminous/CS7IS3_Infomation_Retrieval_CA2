In a message to President Boris Yeltsin, Rybkin said the treaty, scheduled to be signed on Thursday [3 February] at the summit between Yeltsin and Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze in Tbilisi, capital of Georgia, would destabilize the situation in the Caucasian region. Under the treaty, Russia would help Georgia form its armed forces and supply it with military technology, the report said. The Georgian parliament's deputy speaker Vakhtang Rcheulishvili said his nation expected "much from Yeltsin's visit," adding that the visit would mark the beginning of a new stage in relations between the two countries. However, Sokrat Dzhindzholia, leader of the secessionist Abkhazia region of Georgia, Tuesday expressed his opposition to the Russian- Georgian treaty. He stressed that such an agreement should be signed only after the conflict between Georgia and Abkhazia is completely settled and the latter's political status determined. Abkhazia, an autonomous republic of Georgia, declared its independence from the central government in July 1992. Since then, the two sides have been involved in a bloody conflict. Meanwhile, leaders of South Ossetia, another autonomous region of Georgia, accused Russia today of "inconsistency" in its approach to signing the treaty with Georgia. South Ossetia has had a long-time military conflict with Georgia since it declared independence from Tbilisi in November 1991. South Ossetian leaders complained that Georgia still refused to hold talks with South Ossetia on its political status. They feared that Georgia would use the treaty with Russia against South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, who arrived in Tbilisi today for preparations for Yeltsin's visit, stressed that the future of the military and political cooperation between Russia and Georgia partly depends upon the settlement of the political status of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
