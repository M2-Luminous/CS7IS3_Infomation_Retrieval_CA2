But they added that progress was slower in another dispute threatening to block membership for Austria, Finland and Sweden as well as Norway -- over how their entry would affect the delicate balance of power in the EU. German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said he was "cautiously optimistic" that the EU would reach an accord with Norway later Tuesday over a Spanish demand for increased access to Norwegian cod. He was speaking as the EU ministers were considering a new Norwegian offer to break the deadlock which has delayed agreement for Norway to join the 12-nation union along with the three other applicants on January 1. Kinkel told journalists: "If we should succeed in getting a positive solution for Norway, I cannot imagine that the entire enlargement process will be blocked (by the balance of power dispute)." Spain and Portugal are claiming the right to take about 25,000 tonnes of cod a year out of Norwegian waters in return for accepting Norway into the EU -- a condition which Oslo has refused. But a Norwegian diplomat said the EU had been offered a new and complicated fish catch formula which might satisfy Spain and "contains almost all the elements of an agreement." [passage omitted]
