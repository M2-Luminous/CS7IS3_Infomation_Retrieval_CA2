Talks on a political solution to the conflict, held in Geneva since Tuesday with Russian participation, will continue May 10 in Moscow. The idea is to create a decentralised new state within the same frontiers, said Brunner, special representative of UN secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. The United Nations is insisting on the principle of territorial integrity in the proposal, which has been presented to both delegations, and "the two sides have come closer on a certain number of points and ideas," he commented. Brunner could not say whether the Abkhazians, who have fought for independence throughout 1993, would accept such a compromise. "We are talking on the basis that they accept to discuss a state which is not an independant Abkhazian state, but I cannot read their hearts," he said. A ceasefire agreement signed in Moscow April 4 includes talks on the return of Georgian refugees to Abkhazia and the deployment of UN peacekeepers as well as the political settlement. Brunner said he was waiting for a response from the two sides this weekend to a framework proposal for a UN force including up to 30 percent Russian troops and contingents from other former Soviet republics. Last week UN and Russian negotiators came up with proposals for a buffer force of 2,500 international observers between the two sides along the Inguri River.
