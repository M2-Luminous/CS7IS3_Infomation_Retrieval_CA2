Hata, answering questions at the House of Representatives Budget Committee, said Japan and the U.S. have deepened mutual understanding through a series of recent contacts on the issue. The premier said vice ministerial-level negotiations in Washington on resumption of a new bilateral trade framework have neared conclusion, although he has not received a report on the results. Japan cannot accept such numerical targets, Hata said, "and I expect it (the outcome of the negotiations) is not likely to have such things." Tokyo has rejected a U.S. demand to introduce such targets, which led to a collapse in February's bilateral summit. According to Japanese officials, Japan and the United States late Monday resumed long-stalled talks on a new trade framework following an agreement that was clinched after four days of tough negotiations. They said the results of the agreement will be announced Tuesday night Japan time, but they did not provide other details. Hata reiterated that Japan must make efforts to further open its market on its own initiative, through deregulation and clarifying procedures to access the market.
