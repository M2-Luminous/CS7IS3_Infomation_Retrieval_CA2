FR940208-2-00107 FR940208-2-00074 OCC Rule 604(b)(2) and ICC Rule 502(a)(5) also specify a diversification requirement for a designated foreign currency fund's portfolio investments. Specifically, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, no more than 25% of a fund's total portfolio investments may be held in the securities of a single issuer and with respect to 50% of the fund's total portfolio investments, no more than 5% of such assets may be invested in the securities of a single issuer. 12 OCC and ICC believe that these standards create reasonable and prudent safeguards as they have been adapted from the Commission's rule applicable to money market funds. 12 OCC and ICC have been advised that the portfolios of such funds would be considered diversified under the requirements of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (``Code''). The Code's 25% limitation on investments in the securities of a single issuer applies to non-U.S. government securities. The current market value of deposited shares of each fund will be calculated by multiplying the number of deposited shares by the fund's last reported net asset valuation. That amount, less any ``haircut'' and, in the case of mutual funds denominated in a designated foreign currency, exchange rates that OCC or ICC apply for their protection, will represent the amount of margin credit given to a clearing member with respect to such shares. OCC Rule 604(b)(2)(B) and ICC Rule 502(a)(5)(B) contain other provisions that also are intended for OCC's and ICC's protection. OCC and ICC will be permitted to establish a limitation on the amount of the margin requirement in an account of a clearing member which may be met by depositing shares of any one fund. The chairman or president (or their designee) also will be authorized to limit the amount of margin credit given to each clearing member that has deposited shares of a particular fund to an account of OCC or ICC. 13 OCC and ICC further will be authorized to redeem or otherwise order the disposition of deposited shares at any time without prior notice to the clearing member regardless of whether or not the clearing member has been suspended. 13 For example, should the number of transferred shares of a particular mutual fund represent in OCC's or ICC's view a disproportionate number of the fund's outstanding shares, this authority could be relied on to limit the total percentage of shares given margin credit by OCC or ICC. With this authority, OCC and ICC may be able to take precautionary measures in order to limit their liquidation risks. This authority is premised on a similar provision contained in OCC Rule 1106(e), which was approved by the Commission in Release No. 34&hyph;27104. OCC and ICC contemplate that the shares of mutual funds will be uncertificated securities and that shares acquired by a clearing member will be deposited with OCC or ICC via book-entry. The shares will be registered in OCC's or ICC's name to secure the obligations of the depositing clearing member to OCC or ICC. Consistent with other OCC and ICC rules, all gain or dividends accrued on such shares (prior to their redemption or disposition) will belong to the depositing clearing member. In considering whether to accept mutual fund shares as a qualified form of margin collateral, OCC and ICC became aware of the Global Settlement Fund (``GSF''). GSF is an open-end investment company registered with the Commission. Based upon information presented by GSF concerning the portfolios that it offers, OCC's and ICC's boards have approved the acceptance of GSF shares. A complete description of GSF policies and operations is contained in its registration statement and amended prospectus, which are incorporated by reference herein. 14 The following paragraphs summarize the portions of GSF's prospectus on which OCC and ICC rely in accepting GSF shares. 14 The registration statement by which GSF is offering its securities was declared effective by the Commission on March 13, 1992. GSF's prospectus was amended on September 4, 1992. GSF currently is designed to offer three individual portfolios, each of which is represented by a separate series of common stock of GSF. The three portfolios are denominated in U.S. dollars (``U.S. dollar portfolio''), British pound sterling (``pound portfolio''), and Japanese yen (``yen portfolio''). At this time, GSF only offers shares in the U.S. dollar portfolio. Each portfolio is authorized to invest in specific instruments. The investments in the U.S. dollar portfolio are limited to U.S. Treasury securities with maturities of ninety days or less and repurchase agreements covering U.S. Treasury securities. Such repurchase agreements must be secured by U.S. Treasury securities having no more than two years remaining to maturity. 15 The average portfolio maturity of the U.S. dollar portfolio is fifty days. The pound and yen portfolios will be limited to investments in the short-term obligations of the British and Japanese governments, respectively, and certain short-term certificates of deposit, and demand or time deposits of British and Japanese banks, respectively, with credit ratings in one of the two highest rating categories of two NRSROs. In addition, the pound and yen portfolios will invest in the short-term debt securities of supranational organizations which have a credit rating in the highest rating category of two NRSROs. The yen portfolio also will invest in repurchase agreements secured by direct obligations of the Japanese government which have a remaining term to maturity of no more than two years. The average term to maturity of securities in the pound and yen portfolios is thirty days. Accordingly, the investment activities of the U.S. dollar, pound, and yen portfolios meet the applicable standards of proposed OCC Rule 604(b)(2) and ICC rule 502(a)(5). 15 According to GSF's prospectus, the U.S. dollar portfolio will not enter into a repurchase agreement with an issuer if, as a result of such repurchase agreement, the portfolio will have invested more than 10% of its total assets in repurchase agreements with that issuer.
