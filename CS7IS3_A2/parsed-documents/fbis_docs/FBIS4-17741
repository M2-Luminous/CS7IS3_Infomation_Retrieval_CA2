At the special meeting on Tuesday the faction discussed the draft statement which says that on April 25 the president's administration agreed to groundless concessions to the separatist tendancies of regional elites, by excluding from the text the unconditional priority of the Constitution of the Russian Federation over the constitutions of the Federation's constituent members. In view of this, the faction said that this violated the will of the people of Russia who voted on December 12, 1993 for the Constitution of the Russian Federation. The statement says that the faction can sign the treaty without the above changes. Faction members have proposed several wordings. Deputy Gleb Yakunin proposed to recommend that the Russian president postpone the signing ceremony before the treaty's text is fully coordinated. The faction will make the final decision on the signing before its morning meeting on Wednesday.
