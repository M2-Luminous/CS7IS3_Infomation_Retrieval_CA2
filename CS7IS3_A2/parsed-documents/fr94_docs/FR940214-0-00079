Introduction Manufacturers typically comply with the parking brake requirements in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 121, Air Brake Systems , by equipping their air-braked vehicles with spring brake systems. With these brake systems, air pressure holds the spring in the released position when a vehicle is being driven. Upon parking, the air pressure is vented, allowing the springs to apply the parking brakes. Consistent with NHTSA's policy to issue Federal safety standards that are not unnecessarily design restrictive, the agency has conducted a number of rulemakings to ensure that the standard does not unnecessarily prevent the manufacture of parking brake systems other than conventional spring brake systems (e.g., air-applied, mechanically held parking brake systems). See 44 FR 46850, August 9, 1979; 51 FR 10641, March 28, 1986; 56 FR 26927, June 12, 1991. In 1992, International Transquip Industries, Inc. (ITI), a manufacturer of an air-applied, mechanically held parking brake system, informed NHTSA that it believed two of Standard No. 121's current requirements are unnecessarily design restrictive or otherwise inappropriate for its brake system design. One of these requirements specifies that a vehicle must meet parking brake grade holding requirements on a 20 percent grade (or other equivalent requirements), with ``any single leakage-type failure'' of certain parts, including a failed diaphragm. See S5.6 of Standard No. 121. ITI argued that this requirement is unnecessarily restrictive with respect to its air-applied, mechanically held single diaphragm brake system. That company argued that its brake system is designed so that the diaphragm will never experience a major failure, and that vehicles equipped with its brake system can be parked on a 20 percent grade in the presence of the types of diaphragm failures that typically occur. The other requirement that ITI believed is inappropriate for its brake design is the supply line pressure requirement for trailers. See S5.8.2. This requirement addresses brake drag. According to ITI, it is inappropriate for its brake system, which is designed so that its brakes are either fully applied or fully released. II. Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Comments on the Proposal After considering ITI's arguments, NHTSA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that proposed certain changes to Standard No. 121. (58 FR 13437, March 11, 1993). Specifically, the agency proposed to amend the requirements related to the application and holding of parking brake systems and the requirements related to the supply line pressure retention for trailer brakes. In that notice, the agency tentatively concluded that these amendments would remove unnecessary restrictions, thus facilitating the use of air-applied, mechanically held parking brake systems. The agency further explained that the Standard should not unnecessarily prevent parking brake systems that are different than conventional spring brake systems. The agency believed that this proposal would provide regulatory relief by removing a restriction affecting the use of non-spring brake systems, while continuing to ensure appropriate grade holding performance of air braked heavy vehicles. NHTSA received twelve comments on the proposal. Among the commenters were ITI, which commented twice; the Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association (MEMA), a trade association that represents heavy duty brake manufacturers; spring brake manufacturers and spring brake rebuilders, including Midland-Grau, MGM Brakes, Neway Anchorlok, Allied Signal, TSE Brakes, and Ferodo America; heavy vehicle manufacturers including GM/Volvo White and Freightliner; and the American Trucking Associations (ATA). There was no consensus among the commenters about whether the proposal should be adopted. While ITI favored the proposal which it believed would eliminate an unnecessary design restriction, the manufacturers of spring brake systems opposed it. The spring brake manufacturers would experience increased competition from the additional use of air-applied, mechanically held systems, which, according to ITI currently represent 2 percent of the air brake chamber market. The ITI system would provide weight savings but would cost an additional $28 more per axle than spring brake chambers. The spring brake manufacturers argued that the proposal poses significant safety problems since they believe that brake diaphragms can and do experience rapid catastrophic failures. The commenters also addressed specific issues about the proposed test procedure for air-applied, mechanically held parking brake systems and the need to retain the supply line pressure requirement for vehicles equipped with these systems. The agency has analyzed the comments and responds to the significant ones below. III. Agency Decision A. Grade Holding Requirements 1. Background Considerations Standard No. 121 currently requires an air-braked vehicle to have a parking brake system that enables it to meet certain grade holding requirements. Manufacturers have the option of complying with either a 20 percent grade holding test or an equivalent static drawbar pull test. The purpose of the parking brake requirement is to ensure that an air-braked vehicle has adequate parking brake performance on a grade.
