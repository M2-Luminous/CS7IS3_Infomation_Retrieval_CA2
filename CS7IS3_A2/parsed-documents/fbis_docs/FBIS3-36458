The Agro-Industrial Complex Will Cost Russia 10 Times the Food Import"] [Text] In yesterday's session the Council of Ministers Presidium approved the Russian Federation Government resolution "On the Functioning of the Russian Federation Agro-industrial Complex in 1994" and issued orders for it to be finalized within 10 days. The draft was prepared by Zaveryukha's department with the participation of representatives from the Foreign Economic Relations Ministry, the Russian State Fishing Committee, the Central Bank, the Fuel and Energy Ministry, and was then approved by the Economy Ministry practically without comment. The sole department that strongly criticized this "lobby allowance" was the Finance Ministry. This must be why two days before the session Zaveryukha sent a letter to the presidium accusing the Finance Ministry of sabotaging the program for revitalizing the agricultural sector, and yesterday he stated: "Russia must feed its peasants." In addition to the measures of state support for the agro-industrial complex (an investment credit of 1.3 trillion rubles and 2.8 trillion rubles of centralized capital inputs for the first quarter of 1994), it was proposed to preserve subsidies for centralized food imports and establish subsidy coefficients for imported technological equipment. Furthermore it is envisioned to compensate 30 percent of expenditures for fertilizer purchases and to impose restrictive custom duties on the import of "white sugar, wool, flax and hemp fibers, and industrially harvested fur and pelt materials." According to Economy Ministry estimates, 24 additional measures to support the agricultural sector will call for an additional 14 trillion rubles of budget funds. The aggregate cost of the program for the state budget, however, will amount to 34 trillion rubles ($22 billion at the current exchange rate) which exceeds the volume of agricultural imports 10 fold. "It must be remembered that in Russian agriculture, the sowing season is immediately followed by harvesting," Sergey Vasilyev, head of the Working Center for Economic Reforms, which has not yet been dissolved, said at a press conference yesterday.
