High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to help repatriate Myanmar [Burma] refugees from Bangladesh, Foreign Ministry officials said Friday [14 January]. The contribution is in response to a UNHCR appeal in December for a donation of about 34 million dollars in total for the repatriation program, the officials said. The fund will be used to transport some 200,000 Myanmar refugees, provide goods for daily use and implement small-scale projects on agriculture, health, water and sanitation in support of resettlement of the repatriated people, they said. Islamic residents account for about 3.8 percent of Myanmar's population of 42 million people, according to Foreign Ministry statistics. Since 1991, Islamic Myanmar residents began moving to Bangladesh citing oppression, with the number of Myanmar refugees in Bangladesh reaching 250,000 by March 1992, they said. But based on an agreement between foreign ministers of both countries, the refugees began returning to Myanmar and more than 52,000 people have returned to date, they said.
