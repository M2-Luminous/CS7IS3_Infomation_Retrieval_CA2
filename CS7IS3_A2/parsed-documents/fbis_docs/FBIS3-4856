Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), said a reorganization of the cabinet and a Diet dissolution "are the rights given to the prime minister," and any move is up to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. "We are not in a position to comment on it," Hiraiwa said at a press conference in Hiroshima in western Japan. As for the state of the economy, Hiraiwa said he has an impression that the economic situation has been changing a bit since the start of this year. He noted that he expects the economy to improve following progress in corporate restructuring. Hiraiwa was asked for his comment on the Bank of Japan's latest quarterly survey of business sentiment released Tuesday that indicated a halt in the nine-month deterioration in the business outlook. Hiraiwa said, however, that a stronger yen could be a drag on economic recovery and warned that Japanese companies would be in trouble if the yen strengthens any further.
