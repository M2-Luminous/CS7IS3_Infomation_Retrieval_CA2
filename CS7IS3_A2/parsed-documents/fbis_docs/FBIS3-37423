Three reactors are being discharged, but even under such a fuel-saving regime the station's fuel reserves may run out in three months. The plant has no money to buy fuel, because power consumers do not pay their debts. Moreover, the "Electrostal" works which produced nuclear fuel for the plant also halted lines -- as its debtors do not pay either. The power plant from now on will be able to supply energy only to St. Petersburg and its region, while other consumers situated on a vast territory of the north-western part of Russia are likely to face energy shortages very soon. It is for the second time this year when the station is on the verge of stoppage. Early in January it warned it may shut down reactors as it had no money to buy fuel. Two days later it received four billion roubles (about three million dollars) out of the total 34-billion rouble debt from its clients. The plant's administration, however, warned that the four billion roubles would not last for long.
