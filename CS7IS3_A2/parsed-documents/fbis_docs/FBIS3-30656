"People are being shot at in a marketplace and negotiations are being held Geneva with those who are not in the least willing to prevent this," Medek said, adding that this absurd situation "is declassifying us all." Medek was reacting to the shelling of a marketplace in the center of Sarajevo on Saturday in which 66 people were killed and 200 wounded.
