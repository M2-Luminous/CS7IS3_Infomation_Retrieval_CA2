The petroleum ministers of OPEC member countries were not able to reduce their production ceilings at the Geneva session due to opposition by Saudi Arabia. Subroto, the OPEC secretary general, announced at the conclusion of the OPEC ministerial session that OPEC will retain the ceilings agreed upon for the first quarter of the current year until the year's end. Most of the OPEC member countries and some non-OPEC oil-producing countries had expressed their willingness to reduce oil production in order to boost prices. At the conclusion of the OPEC session, our Petroleum Minister Aqazadeh announced his displeasure at the latest OPEC decision and explained that the responsibility for the consequences of this decision will be solely on those who have prevented OPEC from reaching a consensus on reducing production and stabilizing the market.
