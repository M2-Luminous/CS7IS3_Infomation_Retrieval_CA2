When the county people rose in a powerful struggle against the development of nuclear weapons and the construction of the nuclear waste dump by the puppet clique on the 12th and 13th of May, the puppets ruthlessly cracked down upon the protesters and touched off a wave of arrest targeted at those who led the protest. The news analyst says: It is the Kim Yong-sam group that must be brought to justice in South Korea, the group that has introduced U.S. nuclear weapons and, as if it were not enough, is stepping up its own criminal nuclear development to impose a nuclear scourge upon the nation and is bringing sufferings to the people by dumping nuclear waste at random. The puppets, themselves being the criminals, are brutally suppressing the people in the anti-nuke struggle. This is a shameless and outrageous fascist violence, which reminds us of a thief crying "stop thief!". The Kim Yong-sam clique must immediately stop developing nuclear weapons and dumping nuclear waste and step down as demanded by the people.
