The opposition, deprived of power, is heaping reproaches and accusations on the government, particularly the prime minister. As usually happens, the more one tries to expose lies, the more one's truth is doubted. One day, however, history will tell us the true story about each government. Today, Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik has the word. [Melicharkova] Your government has been in power 100 days. It is time to render an account, and we can now safely say whether the individual members of the government are the right people in the right place. Do you have the feeling that your colleagues meet the criteria of the times? [Moravcik] In this period, the government has shown itself to be a well-functioning team. We may have different opinions regarding certain problems, but it is a very important fact that we have always been able to find solutions without having to vote on certain problems and actually count the yes and no votes. That is, practically all decisions are made unanimously after thorough discussion. It is an important fact that this government has been formed as a coalition government because all of the political groups that are participating in it wanted to give the best they had. This, in fact, is the logic of parliamentarism, which has proved itself effective also in this case. From this viewpoint, I can give a positive answer to your question. [Melicharkova] On what basis would you describe your government as successful after 100 days? [Moravcik] I will try to be concise. The biggest problem we had to face was the budget. It was ill-conceived and of low quality, which has mainly affected health care and education. In the first days of our government, we were forced to "quench" the problems that had arisen. We may consider it a positive aspect of this government that we were able to secure the conditions for these spheres to function normally. Moreover, we should mention another problem, related to the budget deficit. From the viewpoint of the transformation of the economy, it is very important for us to keep the deficit at a certain level. The approved budget contained great budgetary risks. It took a lot of energy to eliminate them. We have drafted a project that we are presenting to the National Council of the Slovak Republic. If it is implemented in the way we have proposed, the entire budget system should be consolidated. It is likely that this will have a strong impact in the next period. From this viewpoint, it is possible to consider this a positive aspect, despite the fact that it represents intervention in the tax system. However, we could not have agreed with the increasing deficit because it would only mean postponing the problem for the future, and, if other problems appeared, in addition, a critical situation could arise, which is what we want to avoid. The solution to this problem has a positive impact mainly on the economy, but, in a way, it is also a gift for the next government because it will not have to solve this problem. [Melicharkova] Some of the solutions will require a considerable amount of funds. We cannot expect them to come from abroad only.... [Moravcik] We have succeeded in discovering certain resources in the sphere of privatization, despite the fact that, in view of the specific privatization method in the previous period, the administration of the National Property Fund practically incurred a deficit. We had to quickly change the entire privatization concept and relations between privatization and the National Property Fund, and to draft our own project for recovering the National Property Fund. On the basis of our measures, we have found resources that we can now use as development resources. This means that, in the interest of certain development stimuli, we can use these additional resources to compensate for certain restrictions in the budget. We want to orient them, above all, toward comprehensive housing construction, the road network, the construction of highways, and development of small and medium-size enterprise. At the same time, we have been solving a number of problems associated with the normal functioning of all of the branches. [Melicharkova] How are relations between the government and parliament? The serious misunderstanding between the former government, parliament, and president are well known. Are the constitutional officials at the head of this state people who are able to communicate and find consensus in the interests of the Republic? It is a known fact that the chairman of the National Council of the Slovak Republic is a member of the opposition Movement for a Democratic Slovakia. Do you not have confrontations with him? [Moravcik] There is no situation that would allow a confrontation. I am not interested in a confrontational policy, and it would not even be advantageous. The same applies to relations with parliament. As regards our relations with the president, communication is very efficient and trouble-free. It is in full harmony with what is anchored in the Constitution of the Slovak Republic. [Melicharkova] Which of the problems that you inherited from your predecessors have you already successfully solved? [Moravcik] The problem of the social fund was critical. The solution adopted by the former government was terrible. We succeeded in getting the situation in the social fund into tolerable shape. However, we are not fully satisfied with everything we have achieved. It is a compromise, for sure, and we will try to find a more systemic solution. [Melicharkova] People who do not wish you success (and thereby slander our state, in fact) affirm that this state has no control mechanisms. For example, can the state apparatus function without control mechanisms? Is it at all possible? [Moravcik] It is impossible. Every system has to have control mechanisms. We do not know the real arguments of those who say we do not have control mechanisms. Such an idea is really absurd. Each sector has its control bodies. Financial control, provided by the Slovak Republic's Finance Ministry, has a specific place. Also, the government has a control mechanism. At the Office of the Government of the Slovak Republic, there is a control department to control the fulfillment of government resolutions. The Supreme Control Body of the Slovak Republic has a most important place. We have abolished the specific control body at the Office of the Government of the Slovak Republic because such a thing is very strange from the viewpoint of the usually accepted control mechanisms. It is something that does not exist anywhere in the world. To establish a control body at the government office, which, in fact, serves the government, and to make a central state organ from the office of the government is a concept that is not known anywhere in the world. We were possibly the only state in the world that had an absurd thing like that. It was therefore quite logical for us to change this system and harmonize it with what is usually done in the world. The fact is that the control system of the Office of the Government of the Slovak Republic was often misused to settle personal accounts or to pursue personal goals. Such a way of "self-realization" in the state administration is unacceptable.
