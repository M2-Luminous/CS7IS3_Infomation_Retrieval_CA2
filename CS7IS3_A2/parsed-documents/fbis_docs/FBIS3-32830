He added the U.S. participation as part of the support group has not been confirmed yet. [Begin recording] [Torres y Torres] CCD congressmen are not stating the Peruvian Government's official position. In this specific case I have expressed an opinion as an independent congressman and now as CCD president. [sentence as heard] The country's position is taken by the president of the Republic and the Foreign Ministry, however. [Unidentified reporter] Has the United States in any way confirmed its participation in the support group? [Torres y Torres] Nothing has been stated yet regarding support being suspended or anything of the sort, just the U.S. concern on this issue. We have agreed on the need to wait a few more days or weeks so this chapter related to the La Cantuta issue can be played out by events to come. Concerning La Cantuta, we at Congress expect an effective pronouncement, a just and exemplary sentence, and we expect it will complete the outlook of to what we have been referring. We expect that resolution will take place very soon. [end recording]
