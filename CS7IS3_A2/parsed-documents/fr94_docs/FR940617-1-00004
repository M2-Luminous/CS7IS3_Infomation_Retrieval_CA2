U.S. Office of Personnel Management. James B. King, Director. Accordingly, OPM proposes to amend 5 CFR parts 870, 871, 872, 873, 874, and 890 as follows: PART 870_FEDERAL EMPLOYEES' GROUP LIFE INSURANCE PROGRAM 1. The authority citation for part 870 continues to read as follows: Authority: 5 U.S.C. 8716; §870.202(c) also issued under 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2); subpart J is also issued under section 599C of Pub. L. 101&hyph;513, 104 Stat. 2064, as amended. 2. In subpart A, §870.102 is revised, §870.103 is redesignated as §870.104, a new §870.103 is added, and newly redesignated §870.104 is amended by revising the introductory test of the definition of Employing Office and by adding paragraph (d) to the definition of Employee Office to read as follows: §870.102 Correction of errors. (a) The employing office may make corrections of administrative errors as to coverage or changes in coverage any time. Retroactive corrections of coverage are subject to the provisions of §870.401(h). (b) OPM may order correction of an error upon a showing satisfactory to OPM that it would be against equity and good conscience not to do so. §870.103 Initial decision and reconsideration. (a) Who may file. (1) An employee may request his or her agency to reconsider an employing office's initial decision denying insurance coverage or the opportunity to change coverage. (2) An annuitant may request his or her retirement system to reconsider its initial decision affecting insurance coverage. (3) A judge may request his or her agency, or retirement system if applicable, to reconsider an employing office's initial decision that denies an entitlement related to assignments under 5 U.S.C. 8706(e) of this chapter. (b) Initial employing office decision. An employing office's decision is considered an initial decision as used in paragraph (a) of this section when rendered by the employing office in writing and stating the right to an independent level of review (reconsideration) by the appropriate agency or retirement system. However, an initial decision rendered at the highest level of review available within OPM is not subject to reconsideration. (c) Reconsideration. (1) A request for reconsideration must be made in writing, must include the claimant's name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, reasons for the request, and, if applicable, retirement claim number. (2) The reconsideration review must be made at or above the level at which the initial decision was rendered. (d) Time limit. A request for reconsideration of an initial decision must be filed within 30 calendar days from the date of the written decision stating the right to a reconsideration. The time limit on filing may be extended when the individual shows that he or she was not notified of the time limit and was not otherwise aware of it, or that he or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from making the request within the time limit. An agency or retirement system decision in response to a request for reconsideration of an employing office's decision is a final decision as described in paragraph (e) of this section. (e) Final decision. After reconsideration, the agency or retirement system must issue a final decision, which must be in writing and must fully set forth the findings and conclusions. §870.104 Definitions. * * * * * Employing office means the office of the agency or retirement system to which jurisdiction and responsibility for life insurance actions have been delegated. * * * * * (d) For judges of the United States Court of Veterans Appeals, the employing office is the United States Court of Veterans Appeals. * * * * * 3.
