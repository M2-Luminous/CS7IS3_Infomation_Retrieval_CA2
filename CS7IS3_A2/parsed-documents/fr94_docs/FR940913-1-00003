FR940913-1-00003 FR940913-1-00001 Sections 1650.21(e) and 1650.22(d) are added to explain that the requirements for establishing an exception in a loan application in 5 CFR 1655.18 are the same as those for establishing an exception in a withdrawal application. It is for this purpose that the loan provisions are cross-referenced. Finally, §1650.22 provides that the Executive Director may grant an exception to the requirement that the participant obtain his or her spouse's signature where there are exceptional circumstances that warrant such an exception. In §1650.22(b)(2)(iii) the example of an acceptable court order which would relieve a participant of the obligation to obtain his or her spouse's signature is revised. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. They will affect Board procedures relating to the processing of requests for exceptions to spouse signature and notice requirements applicable to certain requests to withdraw account balances. E.O. 12291 I certify that this is not a major rule. Paperwork Reduction Act I certify that these regulations do not require additional reporting under the criteria of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.
