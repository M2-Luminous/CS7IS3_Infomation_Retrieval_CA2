He spoke with reporter Algimantas Brazaitis, former chairman of the Lithuanian Cinematographic Committee. [Brazaitis] Welcome to Lithuania. We, the former colleagues, used to meet in Vilnius quite often. However, I would call this meeting the first one due to your different position -- you are the first Belarusian envoy to independent Lithuania. [passage omitted] [Voytovich] I am convinced that we will preserve the tradition of friendship. The first indicator was the cultural agreement between Belarus and Lithuania as independent states, which I had the honor to sign with Dainius Trinkunas, your minister of culture and education. [Brazaitis]This agreement was really the first sign of spring. However, after changing your position from the Belarusian minister of culture to that of the first Belarusian envoy to Lithuania, you will have to develop most diverse relations. How do you imagine this mission and the future of Lithuanian-Belarusian interstate relations? [Voytovich] Any civilized state, and I believe unconditionally that Lithuania and Belarus are such countries, gives priority to its relations with the closest neighbors. This is particularly vital to our nations with long-standing friendship and similar fates. Due to their position in the center of Europe and a peculiar buffer role between the East and the West, they have experienced many crucial ordeals. [passage omitted] Having achieved independence, our nations are creating democratic European states. In this case, the goals of Belarus and Lithuania coincide. We have mutual interest from the geopolitical and economic viewpoint. Our state has no access to the sea, while the shortest road to a Baltic port runs across your country. Your most direct transit routes to Ukraine, Russia, and other Eastern states run through Belarus. Those countries have a vast economic potential and boundless markets. There are several other factors promoting cooperation and providing chances for mutual benefit of our nations. While presenting my credentials to His Excellency Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas, I stated: I believe that my key and strategic goal and spiritual vocation as a Belarusian envoy to the Republic of Lithuania is to do everything possible in developing and strengthening our constant political and economic relations. I am ready to keep my word. [Brazaitis]Your persistence deserves respect. I know your friendly attitude toward Lithuania which you demonstrate in resolving the problems of cultural cooperation. However, some politicians caused a commotion when you called Vilnius the capital of Belarus in the Belarusian paper ZVYAZDA. [Voytovich] While giving an interview for this paper, I spoke about historical, cultural, and spiritual relations between our nations. I really stated that Vilnius was also the capital of the Belarusians in the past. Our nations lived in the same state and had one capital -- Vilnius -- during the times of the Grand Dutchy of Lithuania. I am convinced that history unites rather than divides us. There was not the slightest hint in this phrase that I claimed your beloved capital. Other interpretations of my words are incorrect. I even stressed in the same interview that "all issues must be resolved following the provision of the Helsinki Final Act on the inviolability of borders in post-war Europe. In my new office, I will place emphasis on mentality and a peaceful attitude -- the traits typical of both nations. At the same time, I will execute the conceptual policy of my parliament and the government." This is exactly what was said and written. [Brazaitis]Could you tell us a few words about Adutiskis? This issue is still being discussed in the Lithuanian and Belarusian press and politicians' offices. [Voytovich] A problem does exist. However, I would request reporters not to dramatize this situation. Emotions and strong words are only an obstacle. A bilateral commission is working on the delineation of the border, and it has already accomplished much. The positions of the two parties have differed even in 40 cases. However, following the principles of parity in international relations and of the established use of land, we have found a solution. I hope that by working in this manner, the commission will find a solution for the Adutiskis railway station acceptable to both parties. [Brazaitis]Mr. Ambassador, while representing the interests of the state, one must bear in mind the political forces and consider relations between the ruling group and the opposition in one's country. What could you tell TIESA readers about such most prominent political leaders as V. Kebich, S. Shushkevich, and Z. Poznyak? [Voytovich] [passage omitted] I assess all the persons you have listed as normal statesmen and politicians. I am convinced that there can be no civilized state without an opposition. Certainly, I wish the latter were less emotional and angry and more objective, and had more arguments. The upcoming presidential and parliamentary elections will show the weight and recognition of political forces among the population. [Brazaitis]Yevgeniy Konstantinovich, our readers would like to learn more about you. [Voytovich] I was born in a village near Minsk. I graduated from a technical school and an institute. I also finished postgraduate studies. I am a master of economics. My work record is rather vivid -- from a metal worker to a minister and an envoy. I wish I had been a teacher. Pedagogical experience would be very useful now. I am fond of theater, music, and art. I also read fiction, but I prefer historical novels. I play chess. What about a game? I promise a tied score. [Brazaitis]Thank you. I understand that tied scores are the most valuable victories for diplomats.
