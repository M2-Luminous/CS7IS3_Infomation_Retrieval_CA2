The German Steel Federation yesterday announced that the action brought against the EU Commission proposes that the decision to authorize 100 billion Luxembourg francs worth of subsidies for ILVA be reversed. It was reported that the joint action with Preussag Steel AG, Thyssen Steel AG and the Netherlands steel company Hoogovens B.V. would be submitted this Friday. The Council of Ministers approved the subsidies in December at the Commission's proposal. The European Independent Steel Producers' Association EISA has already brought an action against it, and British Steel and the Danish Det Danske Stalvalsevaerk announced such a step. Dark Veil The Steel Federation and companies argued in their action that the massive subsidy was causing severe damage to the private steel companies in all the EU states. The subsidies were unlawful, because they were not consistent with the Steel Subsidies Code. According to the plaintiffs, there was no room for an exemption. The Commission had not asked favored companies for a sufficient commitment in return in the form of a production capacity reduction. The Steel Trade Association welcomed the fact that the Council of Ministers on steel issues has not given any general authorization for subsidies on Wednesday in Luxembourg. The German Steel Federation declared that "a close examination of the individual cases is required before further subsidies are authorized." Until now, they had been cloaked in a thick veil.
