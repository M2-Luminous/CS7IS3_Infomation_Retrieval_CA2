Chop Chomo noted that the first Hercules plane flight departed at 1210 local time, while the second flight departed at 1600 local time en route to Playa Grande, Guatemala. Chop Chomo added that the third flight scheduled for 17 May was canceled due to mechanical failure. Another 360 Guatemalans are expected to return 18 May on two more flights, one at 0900 and another at 1300 local time. Chop Chomo said that representatives of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR] and the Mexican Commission for Aid to Refugees accompanied the refugees to the airport of Playa Grande. He indicated that the Guatemalan Army refuses to allow international observers to accompany the refugees until they reach Pueblo Nuevo, Mayalan, and Santa Maria Tzeja, where returning refugees will settle. According to UNHCR reports, 1,717 Guatemalan refugees will return voluntarily to their country by plane from 13 to 19 May. This operation constitutes the fourth collective return since 20 January 1993 when some 2,500 Guatemalans returned to their country and the first returned by plane. Some 43,000 Guatemalan refugees have lived in camps in southeastern Mexico since the early 1980's, when they began fleeing from attacks by the Guatemalan Army. Meanwhile, Gilberto Ocana Mendez, prison director in Chiapas State, announced that four of the 42 inmates, who began a hunger strike on 16 May, suspended the action following the promise that they would be returned to their country. Guatemalan nationals Alfonso Gabriel Mendez, Juan Lopez Ramirez, Nicolas Vasquez Gabriel, and Marcos Prez Sanchez were arrested after being charged with violating the General Population Law of Mexico. Guatemalan Consul in Chetumal Jose Ignacio Salan Casados visited the inmates to tell them that within hours they would be returning to Colotenango, a community in the northwestern Guatemalan Department of Huehuetenango.
