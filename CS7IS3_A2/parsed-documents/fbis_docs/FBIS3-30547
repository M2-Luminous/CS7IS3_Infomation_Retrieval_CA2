I am not trying to escape from this tragedy, but I am telling you that it is technically difficult [to say where the shell came from]. The day before this attack the shell that landed on Dobrinja came from Serbian positions. Everyone knows that. It killed 10 people. It is a difference of degree, but we know that that shell was Serbian. [Hourdan] And we do not know about this one? [Cot] Technically no. I cannot tell you any more. [passage omitted]
