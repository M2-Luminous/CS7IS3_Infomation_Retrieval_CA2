Sanchez Belisle] [Text] If Panama does not take a tough stand against drug traffickers operating along the Colombian border, in the future they will not only grow coca, but also poppy, Government Minister Jacobo Salas told LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA. "Panama is not only a place where drug trafficking occurs, but also a place where coca plants are grown, and, in the future, if not given the proper attention, poppy fields will also be planted," Minister Salas said after reporting that, in the Darien region, 200 hectares of coca plants were destroyed with herbicides in the latest police operation in March. The official added that every citizen must become aware of the necessity of taking financial steps to equip police with new helicopters to patrol Darien to detect coca plantations. "The number of police units in Darien must be increased. At the same time, they must be adequately equipped to combat the drug traffickers who use the Darien jungle to grow and process the drug," Salas added. The government and justice minister believes the Colombian-Panamanian Treaty that is being advanced by both countries not only will define the borders and outline special services for immigration, customs, and drug trafficking, but that it also will help keep Colombian rebels from using Darien as a base. "I think the danger is alarming, and I hope that with the conclusion of this treaty, which should reach the Legislative Assembly soon, agreements will be formalized that will allow the two countries to join forces to prevent these crimes," Salas added. He also asked the deputies of the National Assembly's Drug Commission to approve the anti-drug bill as soon as possible. "This bill should be approved because there is not one family in Panama that is exempt from the possibility that one of its members, especially a son or daughter, could have a drug problem," Salas said.
