I wish to say that the president of the Republic should not take advantage of the difficult situation we are in by trying to set up transitional institutions the way he wants them. That is why I wish to explain to Rwandans the situation affecting the setting up of the transitional institutions and also to inform them about the content of our talks. [passage omitted] It is not the prime minister's fault that the transitional government has not been formed, but that of the president of the Republic, who wants things done his way so that he can put in place his own ministers from parties he agrees with and also appoint deputies of his choice. Concerning the Republican Democratic Movement, I would like to reiterate that the Arusha agreement specified 11 deputies, not seven. Therefore, I cannot agree that the governmebnt be formed before the four deputies are reinstated. No one took them to court; I am the one who was taken to court. Let them allow me to defend myself and be defeated. Even if I were defeated, so long as the deputies are not taken to court so that they are defeated on their own account, they should [words indistinct]. I would like to add that the meeting of parties called for by the president of the Republic for Friday [25 February] will be useless [words indistinct] with the Rwandan Patriotic Front in accordance with Article 14 of the Arusha agreement. In accordance with that article, the meeting should be called by the parties. If the president wished to take part so as to hear what the parties say, then it is possible, but I do not think that he has the power to call such a meeting. It cannot lead us to anything tangible, since he has already taken decisions about which he informed Rwandans. Thank you for allowing me to address the Rwandans.
