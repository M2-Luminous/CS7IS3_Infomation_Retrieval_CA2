Svanidze opened the program by looking briefly at the immediate accommodation problems facing the new Federal Assembly over video of building work in progress. The interview was interspersed with brief voice excerpts over video of Chernomyrdin speaking on 5 January and of Yegor Gaydar speaking at today's press conference. Svanidze began by asking Burbulis why the Russia's Choice faction left the talks over election of a parliamentary speaker. Burbulis replied: "We realized that these talks had very little to do with the final results of electing a chairman. They were cunningly demonstrative and, moreover, the Russia's Choice bloc risked losing its political face which is something we cannot allow. We are very worried about the possible domination of parliament by two extremist political forces, namely the communist and national- fascist ones and we cannot be linked with decisions worked out hand- in-hand with them." Svanidze then said: "I have learned that a split is developing in the Russia's Choice bloc, or rather has already developed. Incidentally, you were not there next to Gaydar today at the press conference, nor have you formally become one of the bloc's leaders and I have even learned from the lobbies that Andrey Makarov has sharply criticized Yegor Gaydar." Burbulis replied: "I think those observations are rather surface, superficial ones. We criticized not only Gaydar but also each other. Most importantly this partial assessment was needed to evaluate honestly the causes of the relative defeat that we suffered in the elections." Svanidze pressed him further: "If the criticism of Gaydar is connected with a search for reasons for the election defeat, then it would be logical to assume that you link this defeat with the name Gaydar?" Burbulis replied: "No it is not so simple, not so straightforward." Asked whether the Russia's Choice faction should now lobby the present government, Burbulis said; "No I don't believe so and I think that it would be useful both for the government and for the country if our tactics were to draw a precise and clear distinction between those government actions and decisions which correspond to our notion of reform of the country's economy and those which do not correspond to it at all but which manifest contrary interests and aims." Svanidze inquired: "So you do not like being associated with the government?" to which Burbulis responded: "We do not like this and we made a serious mistake in the election campaign when we took on full responsibility for the actions of the government and our opponents readily exploited this." Burbulis added that Russia's Choice would very much like to be able to coordinate its actions with the president, actively and constructively and asserted that "the country needs a new political culture, a culture of coalitional activity. This is required of the president, it is required of the government and it is required of all of us." Asked whether now he personally regarded himself as Yeltsin's political supporter, Burbulis said: "To the extent that the president adopts decisions and acts while preserving the country's reformist, democratic future, yes I am Yeltsin's supporter. Where his actions do not correspond to that future and where they give rise to considerable problems and difficulties in the system of government, I cannot support him and I will not support him." On Russia's Choice's attitude toward Zhirinovskiy, Burbulis had this to say: "Any political or ideological contacts with Zhirinovskiy and his grouping are totally unacceptable until an assessment, including a legal one, has been made of the obscurantism which he has offered the country today." He added: "Any compromises with the national-fascist ideology which threatens to appear and find a mouth-piece in parliament are totally unacceptable," but he accepted that his faction would have to find a way of working with other factions in parliament.
