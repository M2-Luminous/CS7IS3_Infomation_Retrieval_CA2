[see page 5 of 29 October Terrorism Report for arrest reporting] It is amazing that a man who had committed no crime in Belgium and who in no way threatened the interests of the country could be kept under lock and key for so long. The authorities will of course argue that the name of the President of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) is listed with Interpol, and that is reason enough. We will not therefore continue to labor this point. On the other hand, it would be wrong of us to close the matter just because Mr. Amanullah Khan has been released. Too much doubt remains at various levels not to give us cause for concern. Thus, firstly from a diplomatic point of view, we should repeat once more the conclusions of certain analysts who are convinced that the arrest of the JLKF leader in Brussels on 18 October was organized at the request of the cabinet of Mr. Willy Claes, keen to serve a foreign power -- not to put too fine a point on it, the United States -- irritated at seeing the European Parliament participate in the Kashmir crisis. In the light of this, it is interesting to note that a magazine published in Hong Kong and specializing in Asian questions recently carried an in-depth article on Washington's particular and recent interest in Kashmir. As the saying goes, there is no smoke without fire... On a domestic level, certain points at the Foreign Ministry also attract attention. Reliable sources say that Mr. Claes's cabinet may have been informed beforehand of the invitation issued to Mr. Amanullah Khan by the British socialist group at the European Parliament. There is no reason to doubt it, since the Belgian foreign minister is president of the European socialists: between comrades, it is a fairly logical thing to respect the customs required by simple politeness, a point that the German and French diplomatic heads for their part found it convenient to ignore when, during a recent visit to Warsaw, they offered to implement a process of rapprochement between Central Europe and the Western European Union. Indeed, Mr. Claes, who had other things on his plate these last six months, was perhaps not personally informed of Mr. Amanullah Khan's visit before he arrived in Brussels. This is what he claims. If he is telling the truth, however, why then does he not censure the leader of his cabinet, Mr. Willems, who is said to have played a major role in this affair. Moreover, if Mr. Claes is as innocent as the proverbial lamb, why is the minister so keen to drag his ambassador in Islamabad in the mud when his successor, Wilfried Geens, has already been secretly appointed? Could not Mr. Staes too have been unaware of the plot that was being hatched in the office of one of his colleagues -- the consul, in fact. That being said, it is nonetheless significant that Mr. Staes, this non-commissioned officer, this balding and scruffy individual, accused by the minister of having committed "a serious error" will not, it appears, pass before a disciplinary committee. He will "only" be subject to an administrative inquiry. Informed sources say that he will be reprimanded or given a black mark in his file before being invited to wander like a suffering soul through the corridors of the ministry for the good reason that the minister cannot lose face! It all depends on whether you are a prince or a pauper...
