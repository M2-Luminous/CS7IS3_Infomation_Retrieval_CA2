According to the sources, this reflects the most recent Hamas line -- namely, that the organization will not obstruct Palestinian rule in Gaza and Jericho. The sources claim that this clause has created tension between the Islamic Jihad and Hamas, as well as between two Hamas branches: the pro-peace Ahmad Yasin branch and the branch comprising the 10 rejectionist organizations that oppose the agreement. [A related report by Dan Avidan on page 2 of Tel Aviv DAVAR in Hebrew on 26 April cites "Arab sources" as saying that "PLO and Hamas delegations are conducting secret negotiations in Cairo in an attempt to conceptualize the ties between the two movements on the eve of the Israel Defense Forces withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho" and that "the PLO-Hamas encounter was arranged through the mediation of Hamad Abu-al-Nasr and Sayf al-Din al-Banna, leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood movement in Egypt."]
