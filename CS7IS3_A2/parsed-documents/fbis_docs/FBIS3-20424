A Year of Conscientious Enforcement Has Brought Countless Great Achievements On 19 November 1993, the State Council Peasant Burden Enforcement Inspection Group fully affirmed Liaoning Province's work in lightening peasant burdens. In 1993, Liaoning has lightened peasant burdens by over 200 million yuan. The Liaoning Provincial Party Committee and Peoples Government have inventoried 98 documents on 113 items involving peasant burdens; they have published and issued 700,000 copies of the "Regulations on Peasant Responsibility for Costs and Labor Management," with supervisory organs having dealt with 28 cadres for discipline violations; Liaoning Province and all townships have set up committees on lightening peasant burdens, with many peasants having received "burden cards"; according to State Council provision, direct payments by peasants throughout Liaoning of village charges and township overall planning fees have been kept under 5 percent of the previous year's per capita net income. Heishan County has discontinued 410 village mess halls, saving 1.68 million yuan a year. Peasants report that these actions have provided real incentives. But Peasant Burdens Remain Quite Heavy in Some Areas As to the current existing problems in peasant burdens, I interviewed Xiao Zuofu [5135 0155 4395], director of the Liaoning Control and Management Commission on Lightening Peasant Burdens. Vice Governor Xiao pointed out sharply that: "We are now again suffering certain setbacks in peasant burdens, the real root of which is the higher authorities, with beyond-quota apportionments occurring at times, in which some departments mandate apportionments through executive orders, while the leaders of certain other departments give them a free hand. This needs to be stopped at the source, with investigation and prosecution of each case, not even a single case going unpunished, and the disposition results being broadcast in the media and published in the papers for public viewing." Good! Just take a look at this example. On 18 December 1993, I interviewed an office director in the Shenyang Municipal Government Office on Lightening Peasant Burdens, who waved a document at me and complained that: "Even we are being obstructed. Despite our decision to charge peasants only 2 fen [cents] a KWh for power, the province has issued a document raising this to 2.5 fen." The units issuing this document were the "Provincial Pricing Bureau, the Provincial Agropower Office, and the Provincial Power Industry Bureau." When I reported this matter to Vice Governor Xiao, he immediately made a phone call to investigate it, telling me that "without the approval of the Liaoning Management Committee on Lightening Peasant Burdens, arbitrary issuing of documents to raise prices is prohibited." Such "audaciousness" is not limited to this one case alone! While the Liaoning Party Committee and Government published in LIAONING RIBAO on 2 July 1993 its first group of 10 peasant burdens to be eliminated, one of which was the "charge for keeping a dog," departments, such as the Anshan Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Anshan Management Office on the Keeping of Dogs, still issued an official document in September, brazenly charging peasants 50 yuan per dog, which one case alone cost peasants the huge amount of millions of yuan! Good, that's enough! Any more such details might lead to concern that I was seizing on these incidents to exaggerate the matter. But there are even more infuriating cases. In Changtu County, 59 percent of the salaries of public school teachers are actually paid by peasants, meaning that the over 14 million yuan becomes a peasant burden! And for the whole city of Tieling, this figure reaches a high of 27.9 million yuan. And even this is not the whole extent of the problem. Peasants complain bitterly about tractor fees. I investigated this matter in the two cities of Shenyang and Jinzhou, finding that 1,000-2,000 yuan a year has to be paid to the authorities for one "small four-wheeler," with more than 20 fees, and even an idle tractor requiring the payment of an eight-month road toll! The city of Benxi has 3,400 tractors, meaning an extra annual expense of over 50 million yuan, which forces peasants who own tractors to collectively appeal to the authorities for help. Even worse, peasants in the vicinity of Gaotaizi Township in Benxi had to pay 5 yuan to drive their tractors across a bridge, and the same toll again on their return, which ended only after the toll booth had been repeatedly toppled by the peasants. A host of mandated press charges weighs heavily on peasants. I discovered in Shengli Township, Heishan County that the township was unable to stop the assessed quotas assigned by various departments, with 803 press subscriptions throughout the township for 41 newspapers and periodicals, costing over 40,000 yuan. Such burdens are also very much the same for other townships. In addition, peasants are also threatened by certain other hidden peasant burdens: 1. While certain peasant-burden items have been removed in 1993, their staffs and agencies are still not fully dismantled. While the burden of "timber buying- and selling-agent fees" has been abolished in the Kuandian Manchu Autonomous County, the 286 personnel in company-installed centers in all villages have certainly not yet been dismissed. 2. While the center has clearly ordered that peasant burdens are to be controlled at 5 percent, with no one daring to overstep this limit, certain poverty-stricken townships have too many economic problems to cope with, so are forced to raise money by borrowing from Peter to pay Paul. And how could such debts not be later put onto peasants heads? 3. Peasants complain bitterly about the public fundraising problems of the Taizi He [river] dredging project. In the next four years, the Liaoyang section of the Taizi He will need 25.52 million yuan to be raised, or 18 yuan a year per capita, amounting to 1.6 percent of peasant burdens; and the Haicheng section will require an additional 60 million yuan, costing peasants 20 yuan a year each. 4. Certain townships have persistently high spending on entertainment, with it being common for donkey carts to come to collect the empty wine bottles. Might not such extravagant entertainment be running wild? And there are 5, 6, 7, etc. So what does all of this say? As to resolving the fundraising by all departments, no one is willing to "fill up the holes." And the projects that need stopped or slowed are like stiff-necked "ducks." This is the concentrated expression of a problem: Some departments are so blinded by greed and insatiably avaricious that it makes one boil with anger! In their own selfish interests, they brazenly exploit their authority to wantonly hold out their hands to the peasants. Unless such regressive corruption is ruthlessly and thoroughly punished, its cheating of the peasants will grow even worse. What Is the Root of the Heavy Peasant Burdens? "While the problem of heavy peasant burdens shows up in the rural areas, it is rooted in all upper-level departments." The center has sharply pointed out the crux of the matter. In a document entitled "The Pace of Reform Needs Speeded Up," Comrade Deng Xiaoping has pointed out acutely that: The objective that our reform needs to reach is to develop the productive forces under the leadership of the party and the socialist system. Rural reform was necessary to stimulate peasant initiative. Why did reform have to start in the rural areas? This is because the rural population makes up 80 percent of China's population so that, without rural stability, our overall political situation would be unstable and, unless peasants overcome their poverty, China will not cast off its poverty. Lightening peasant burdens is essentially the major matter of stimulating peasant initiative. Today's peasants, as producers and consumers, are the most important players in China's market economy, so that their initiative is the most vital element of the productive forces. Formalistic things among the abovementioned leading cadres of certain departments, such as not yet having escaped in their heart of hearts from the longstanding planned-economy trap, still being accustomed to issuing the same old orders, going in for grandiose achievements, and engaging in unrealistic striving for position, competition, and reaching standards, are precisely the real root of the heavy peasant burdens! What they lack is exactly the key line of an objective approach! No wonder the first group of 46 rural standard reachings that were eliminated by Liaoning included those, such as "reaching toilet standards," "rat-extermination standards," and "fuel-economy standards." The following jingle is spreading in the area around Changtu, Liaoning: "Tobacco, big sheds, and irrigated wheat are the peasants' three scourges." The disaster is that certain cadres apply or copy mechanically, without regard for the relation beween market supply and demand, forcibly raising funds from peasants to start projects. From this "construction project" and that "reaching of the standard" to your village raising funds to install a computerized telephone system, everything is praised, so that my village too must install one. Such "left" formalistic things that proceed not from reality have pervasively infiltrated from life to the system and directly into the bones of certain leading cadres, thus leading to a onesided emphasis on enlarging and developing the collective economy at the expense of property-rights components, and to a unilateral stress on the dominance of the publicly owned economy to the neglect of the reality of the coexistence of diversified economic components. How could an ideological method and workstyle that so distorts reality not make peasant burdens too heavy? On Daring To Ask the Way The basic way to solve the heavy peasant burden will be for the leading cadres of the abovementioned departments to give their minds a rest, by genuinely shifting their standpoints from a planned economy to a socialist market economy, and conscientiously establishing objective ideological concepts. As a socialist market economy is one that is governed by law and order, particular attention needs to be paid to establishing laws and regulations for the rural economy and peasant assets, in order to strengthen oversight and inspection mechanisms, so that peasants dare to face up to their material interests, by taking a genuine part in the legislative process. It is only in this way that the laws and regulations to protect and lighten peasant burdens will be able to lead the way out of the burdens that infringe on peasant interests! Whether Liaoning's second undertaking can now rely on taking off on the two wings of agriculture and industry, by lightening peasant burdens to stimulate peasant initiative, is of extreme importance. As peasant problems are of importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood, better lightening peasant burdens is a top priority for Liaoning's intensification of rural reform! We can no longer allow man-made problems to make peasants run our roads carrying such heavy burdens. This is a demand and a call of history and of the times!
