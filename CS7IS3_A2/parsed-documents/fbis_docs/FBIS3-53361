Welcome, Mr. Minister, to Radio Algiers. To begin with, we would like you to talk to us about the economic and financial situation of Algeria. The first question is about the policies of the treasury. Algeria's budget deficit in 1993 was estimated at 190 billion dinars; this year's budget deficit is estimated at 125.3 billion dinars. This question is how is this deficit going to be met, and what are the repercussions of it on the inflationary pressures which are quite high anyhow. [Benachenhou] One should start by saying in the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate, before anything else. I would like to thank the radio for giving me this opportunity to explain a number of matters of interest relating to the citizens' daily life, including economic and financial problems. Your question was a direct and clear one and I can answer in two parts. I will be talking in the first part about the state expenses and in the second part about the revenues to finance such expenses. [passage omitted] In order to find new revenue we have carried out a study of the economy and found new resources which have never been used before. We have included them in this year's budget. Thanks to these measures we have managed to reduce the budget deficit for this year. Nevertheless, we cannot say that we are fully happy with such a reduction; we would have liked to cut the deficit even further because the more we cut the budget deficit the better we can control inflation. However, we cannot go back overnight on our economic and social commitments. [Correspondent] The 1994 budget was drawn up on the basis of an oil price of $18 per barrel. Some say that this price is very optimistic, in view of the current situation of the oil market and the expected development. If this price is not achieved in the market, what measures does the government intend taking to face this, because this will lead to a reduction in oil revenue, and ultimately perhaps increase the deficit? [Benachenhou] At any rate the government has these expectations on the basis of studies carried out by two international organizations, the IMF and the World Bank. The studies of these two organizations are taken into consideration by all the states which export raw materials, that is, industrial and advanced states or developing states such as Algeria. We based the $18 price on official reports prepared by professional people working in the World Bank and the IMF. There is in fact a reduction in oil prices; there is a fluctuation. We do not know whether the price will go up or down. We had to make a decision in order to prepare the budget of this year and this decision -- as I have said -- was based on international studies which are internationally guaranteed for their feasibility. [passage omitted] [Correspondent ] This year's budget includes for the first time a clause on bankruptcy and legal settlement with regard to public enterprises; is this clause an indication of an effort to overcome the problem of the fate of the public sector and public enterprises? [Benachenhou] We can say two things regarding the role of the public sector in the economy. First, the public sector's share of this country's production is 65 percent. Second, the public sector, including the administrative and industrial sectors, employs about one third of the work force in the country. When we start talking about the reorganization of the public sector we are talking about the reorganization of almost the whole of the Algerian economy, and even the reorganization of Algerian administrative departments. There is no economic scope for a country in which there is no direct or indirect intervention. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Still with the budget law: This year's budget has envisaged reduction of some taxes, i.e. the tax on companies profits, and the reorganization of the income tax as well as a reduction in VAT [value added tax] and the abolition of compensatory tax. Also this year's budget envisages for the first time the provison of extra revenue, about 50 billion dinars, through combating tax evasion. Will the tax authorities have the material and human resources to be able to face up to tax evasion? Also, aren't you afraid that tax reduction will lead to less revenue for the state? [Benachenhou] I would like to stress here that this government is determined to fight tax evasion; tax is a duty and a right. [passage omitted] As far as your second question is concerned I can tell you that there is no direct link between tax revenues and the level of tax imposed on economic activity, which is subject to taxation. In many instances it is better, in order to increase tax revenues, to reduce the percentage of the tax. And this is what we have done. There are instances when the high level of taxation would convince people that it is worthwhile to try to hide their earnings all together from the tax people in order to pay no tax at all. Hence, although we have reduced taxes, we are convinced that such a reduction will increase tax revenues because people will be more inclined to pay them. [Corresponden] [passage omitted] What is the way, in the opinion of the government or the Ministry of Economy, for reviving the national economy? [Benachenhou] Since its formation, the government has taken several measures to raise the confidence of the private sector. This is because, with regard to the public sector, there is a direct and continuous intervention by the state so that the level of production capability will not be lowered further than the current level. The government's idea is that the private sector has capabilities, that is to say, bigger participation in the revival of the economy. Therefore, the government enacted the law on investment which provided tax and financial concessions, so that people in the private sector who have the entrepreneurial spirit and have ideas on investment will be encouraged and take the necessary measures to begin investment. This is the first thing. The other thing is that one knows that banks play a major role in the economy. The government therefore has taken several measures to improve the working and management conditions of banks so that they will participate in a more effective way in financing the economy and particularly in financing investments. The government has been working for five months only, during which it took legal measures, as I outlined earlier, which concern the financial sector and measures within the framework of the financial law. All these measures require time before they begin to have noticeable results in the market. What have we noticed? Generally speaking, we noticed that some kind of revival has taken place. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] On 15 January, an important date, talks resume with the IMF. For the first time since the start of the debt crisis in 1982, Algeria is officially announcing that it is unable to pay its debt service on time and guarantee a minimum level of imports to meet its food needs while continuing its other matters. What are the proposed solutions to surmount this problem, especially as we notice that several expressions and concepts are being used: some people are talking about rescheduling, others are mentioning a multilateral restructuring, and others are suggesting the cancellation of part of the debt? [Benachenhou] The question you have just asked is extremely complex, and I have no immediate answer for it because we are still talking to the IMF and intend to be very thorough at these talks. We will have to discuss almost every sentence included in the reports presented by us and by the IMF. We must also discuss the figures which will define the country's internal financial situation and the figures which will give an idea on the external financial situation. When we have drawn some kind of a joint conclusion, which can only be drawn after we have resumed our talks with the IMF in the second half of January, we will then decide what the most effective way will be to reduce the external debt, because the most important thing is to alleviate the burden of the debt service, irrespective of the expressions used. This is as far as our relations with the IMF are concerned. Moreover, there are states and international banks and financial institutions which have granted us loans. We must also hold talks with these sides in order to reach a formula which will take into account Algeria's interests and our interests [as heard]. We must now stress that the government's objective is to reach a formula which will enable us to alleviate the burden of our external debt. [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, you have touched on the relations or the talks with the IMF and you have said that these talks are both complex and thorough. On the other hand, we know that the IMF, as a financial institution which has experience in negotiating with countries, has almost a model prescription which is well known; namely, a devaluation of the dinar, a reduction in state intervention, and redundancies. On the basis of these facts and this prescription, what room for maneuver does the government and Algeria have in light of lower revenues and the collapse of oil prices? [Benachenhou] I have talked about negotiations and I have not talked about obeying orders from an institution. In any case, Algeria is an independent country and a member of the IMF. Within the framework of its participation in the IMF, it has duties and it also has rights. These duties and rights exist in the context of an international agreement. There is no international institution which can force Algeria to take measures that are not in its interests or that transcend the international relations and legal foundations which exist between our country and the IMF. I should have stressed this at the onset. This means that Algeria has total freedom for maneuver, regardless of the financial and economic difficulties which it is experiencing. In the end, it is for Algeria to decide whether it is economically, financially, socially, and politically able to absorb the IMF's proposals and recommendations or whether these proposals are acceptable. Algeria is totally independent of the IMF regardless of its financial circumstances. You talked about a unified model. I would like to say that this model is not a model that can be exported directly from one country to another. Every country has its own peculiarities regarding its economic and financial structure. Any measure that will be taken or that is agreed upon in the framework of an IMF program must take into account the country's social, financial, and economic peculiarities and also the country's own economic and financial structure. If we had found ourselves in the clear situation which you talked about and in which there would be a unified formula that is applied to all the countries, then there would be no need for talks and we would ask the IMF to send us the list of its measures and we would start implementing them. Then we would ask the IMF: Please send us the money. This is clear. Negotiations are taking place in the real sense of the word. [Correspondent] Your Excellency, you spoke about negotiations with the IMF and stressed that they were negotiations and not a model prescription. But no doubt the issue of the national currency will be raised with the IMF. We note in the market that there is a wide gap between the official rate, which is about 4.5 dinars to the franc, and the black market where the rate sometimes reaches 13 dinars to the franc. How will the problem of the dinar be settled with the IMF, bearing in mind that there are people who are saying that the dinar should be devalued by 50 percent, and others who say that the devaluation should be gradual, 1 percent per month? How will the problem be settled? [Benachenhou] Regarding this problem, it is linked to several factors; there is no direct solution, nor a direct decision with regard to the value of the currency because this rate is linked to other things, including issues which we spoke about earlier, such as the financial deficit and how to finance the deficit. The problem is not that of a financial deficit, but of financing it by existing revenues. In other words, the financial deficit has no influence over the value of the currency. I do not want to conceal from you that when we speak to the IMF we cover all issues relating to the economy and finance, including the budget, foreign trade, the value of the currency, and so on. But the value of the currency is the result of the influence of several factors which are linked to the method of issuing the currency to finance the economy and to the way in which the economy functions and its effectiveness, meaning the production capability available in the economy. People have noticed a kind of fall of the dinar in the black market. I wish to stress two things with regard to the black market: one, what is the value of the deals which are being made within this black market? I do not know. Are these deals marginal in comparison with the volume of all the deals which are made within the economy? Has the parallel market got a bigger role than one can imagine? No one can provide you with an analysis of this. We know and cannot deny that there is a black market, and that the value of the dinar in the black market is less than the official value of the dinar. But there is no direct connection between this black market value and the real value of the dinar. If we tomorrow totally free the value of the dinar; if, for example, tomorrow the Central Bank decides to totally cease fixing the value of the dinar, will this value fall to the level of the black market value or not? No one can tell you. Besides there are no capabilities to estimate or calculate this. What concerns us at this time is to know that the government within the framework of negotiations with the IMF does not accept suggestions which cannot be economically, financially, and socially absorbed, no matter what these suggestions may be, and even suggestions relating to the value of the dinar. [Correspondent] We must not forget that there is a psychological facet concerning the dinar which is greater. Maybe the situation would change if the Central Bank declared its revenue. [Benachenhou] This is true. There is a psychological facet. We can say that there is a flaw in the method of financing revenues in this country. There are matters [word indistinct] linked to trade which could influence the value of the dinar in the black market. Consequently, we must not take that value as a gauge. We must set the real value of the dinar within the framework of the market where there is supply and demand for the dinar and for hard currency. [Correspondent] The other issue which is always raised with that of the IMF is the issue concerning public sector enterprises. In this year's budget, nearly 80 billion dinars have been earmarked for the financial reform of these enterprises and their restructuring. This restructuring requires a mass reduction in the workforce. Has any final decision been taken by the government and the Economy Ministry and what are the expected effects on the unemployment rate, which is already high at nearly 25 percent? [Benachenhou] Indeed, 76 billion dinars have been earmarked in this year's budget for the reorganization of the public sector enterprises. This huge amount of money highlights the state's commitment to take all the necessary measures to revitalize this sector and maintain the economic and social role it is playing at the moment. Moreover, the problems concerning the restructuring of the public sector are very marginal for the IMF institution gives us some recommendations on ways to come out of the crisis. It is our duty as a state to take all the necessary measures to enable this sector to contribute more to the revival of the economy. This contribution is linked to the difficult conditions which the Algerian economy is going through and also to the way these enterprises are managed internally. What are we going to do? We are going to adapt these conditions imposed on the public and private enterprises alike. However, these public enterprises must, as independent enterprises, also take numerous measures to improve their management and reduce the costs which are not directly linked to their production capacity. In any case, we cannot say that these enterprises are waiting for the IMF recommendations to take these measures; several measures have been taken with the collaboration of the social partners. I must once again stress that the restructuring and reform of the economy will not be done at the expense of a given social category. This must be clearly understood. [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, still on the same subject. When we compare figures of the study for 1992, we find that the amount earmarked for financial reforms was 160 billion dinars, in 1993 it was 83 billion, and this year it is estimated at 76 billion. Every year, since 1990, we have been saying that the reorganization of public enterprises would be completed that year. Yet, every time the same problem is raised in the same way. For example, workers' wages are not being paid by many enterprises. Is it possible for the state to continue financing them in this way? [Benachenhou] The state has decided on new bodies for the running of public enterprises. I am talking about the 1989 laws. Their aim was to raise the level of economic and financial responsibility of those enterprises. Within this framework, the state set in motion a number of financial measures in order to restore some financial balance and organization in those enterprises to enable them to become independent. The state has played its role to make those enterprises have an independence built on clear and rational bases. However, for many reasons, some of which are internal to the public enterprise and others connected to the difficult financial and economic conditions experienced by Algeria, those enterprises were not able to reach the required financial balance. Therefore, the state continued to contribute to the financing or refinancing of those enterprises from the funds allocated in the budget for financial assistance. As a government, we are hoping that the time will come when the enterprises will be able to contribute more toward the state budget than allocated to the running of the enterprises. However, circumstances make it necessary for us to support public enterprises for economic reasons because they have a great production capability, and for social reasons too. Those enterprises employ a large number of people and the rate of unemployment would rise if those people were not employed. [Correspondent] Negotiations started recently with the General Union of Algerian Workers. Some are saying or proposing that, since prices are rising rapidly and that there is shortage of numerous basic commodities, wages should be index-linked and raised. What does the Economy Ministry think about this proposal? Will this lead, for example, to an inflationary spiral? [Benachenhou] Negotiations are currently under way with the trade union, the General Union of Algerian Workers, which has an important and essential role to play in providing social protection for the workers. The government is listening seriously to all the analyses which are made by this trade union and which are linked to its role and mission. Several in-depth, frank, and lengthy discussions have taken place with this trade union. These discussions will continue until we reach a formula which will take into account the country's economic and financial conditions, because we cannot take any measure which could have a negative impact on the economic balances and which could lead to a rise in the inflation rate. Any rise in the inflation rate would make the social situation of the workers worse. All I can say is that we are talking to the trade union with an open mind, but we are talking under complex and very difficult circumstances. [Correspondent] The minister delegate of commerce has announced that Algeria has expressed its intention to join GATT, the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade. What are the reasons behind this request, and, if Algeria was to be allowed to join GATT, what would the expected effects be on the national economy, since we know that Algeria exports only hydrocarbons at the moment? [Benachenhou] In any case, several international organizations are in charge of financial, economic, and commercial affairs worldwide. Algeria is probably one of the very few countries which did not participate in GATT, despite the fact that the latter comes under the same general agreements governing the creation of the IMF and the World Bank. Therefore it was necessary for Algeria to complete its membership in these economic institutions and join GATT. We had to join GATT as a complement to our participation in the IMF and the World Bank. In regards to the second part of your question, you are right in saying that Algeria exports on the whole only petroleum and hydrocarbons, but it must organize its foreign trade in order to give itself the opportunity to create and develop other exports. Its participation in GATT would also enable it to take part in the negotiations which are under way on the organization of international trade to the benefit of countries which have products to export, whether these products are raw materials or products that can be linked to services. In any case, GATT has very complex rules and arrangements which cover problems pertaining to the protection of the domestic market. We should not play down the results which we could obtain from our participation in GATT. Thank you very much. [Correspondent] Thank you, Mr. Minister, and goodbye.
