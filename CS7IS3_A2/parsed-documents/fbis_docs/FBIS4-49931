A total of 4,497 Chinese-funded enterprises had invested U.S.$5.16 billion around the world, Mr Li said yesterday. Meanwhile, China had a total of 174,000 foreign-funded projects with actual investment of U.S.$63.9 billion. "China's economic reform is deepening, and its opening to the outside world has made new progress," he said. The rate of overseas investment in China was growing, he said. Last year, the mainland saw foreign investment equal to the total of the previous 14 years. China would continue to carry out preferential treatment for foreign investors, he said. However, "China will gradually implement national treatment towards foreign-founded enterprises, creating a competitive environment on an equal footing for Chinese and foreign investors." The country would introduce further "helpful" reform measures Mr Li said. "In the field of reform, we should focus on invigorating large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises by transforming their operating systems and actively setting up a modern enterprises by trial and error." "We should strengthen and improve macro-control and meticulously implement various reform measures in taxation, finance, investment and the foreign exchange system, while ensuring that these are smoothly carried out," he said. This year it was important for China to speed up the establishment of a socialist market-economy and maintain sustained, rapid and healthy development of the national economy. "Now, China is advancing toward its second goal in its economic and social development drive and establishing a new socialist market economy," he said. Mr Li was speaking at the opening of the '94 China Summit Meeting held in Beijing. The meeting provides a multilayered opportunity for Chinese and foreign officials, entrepreneurs and economists to meet and discuss economic theories and practices. At the summit, Chinese Trade Minister Wu Yi launched a thinly veiled attack on the United States for politicizing trade issues in his keynote speech that mapped out China's trade strategy for the 1990s. Describing the next seven years as a "crucial period", Ms Wu outlined plans to shift the focus of China's export production, narrow regional economic disparities in the country and complete the construction of a legal framework governing foreign trade by 1997. While China is committed to the "extremely heavy and arduous task" of economic development, Ms Wu said progress was being threatened by countries exerting economic pressures for political ends. Ms Wu also made it clear that trade disputes with Beijing could penalise other countries, predicting that total imports to China in the next seven years "may well reach U.S.$1 trillion".
