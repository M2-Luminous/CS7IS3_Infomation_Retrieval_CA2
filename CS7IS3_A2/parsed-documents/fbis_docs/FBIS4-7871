This is enough for certain things and too little for others. A few minutes after the new prime minister appointed Pavol Kanis deputy minister of the Slovak Republic, we had the opportunity to ask Moravcik several questions. It is up to our readers to decide whether they were the correct ones. [Correspondent] Sir, what do you think can be done in the defense sector before the elections? [Moravcik] I believe that we have to use the six months to proceed in the main direction of the development of the Army. I may be influenced by the fact that I was foreign minister. I am mainly stressing integration links. The Army should become more active in that direction--that is, it should continue with the integration trends that have started because our security is based at present on the principle of collective security. Collective security requires integration. This is what I consider the main direction, on which many other things are dependent, as regards the structure of the Army, its training, etc. [Correspondent] Many of our Army's problems are caused by a lack of funds. Do you believe we will be able to defend the Army's budget when other sectors raise their demands? [Moravcik] This year, I have no doubt about it. However, there are pressures in this direction. We have to be patriots--that is, we have to keep the Army on at least such a level as permitted by the budget for this year. Next year, we will see. If we can take a tougher step in the economic sphere to prevent the declining trend in national production, we will have more opportunities for the Army. I firmly believe that we will manage it. [Correspondent] As regards the Army, we have gotten used to the idea that political decisions take precedence over military ones. Do you believe this era has already ended? [Moravcik] I would not draw a sharp line between military and political decisions. Some decisions are purely military and technical. Politics has no place there. It would be absurd. On the other hand, other important decisions regarding the Army are highly political. I do not see a problem here. [Correspondent] How do you view the prospects of the Army in the next years to come? [Moravcik] We have to modernize the Army further. I believe that this trend has already begun and that the Army has become self-confident, which is very important. If the Army becomes even more confident in contacts with other armies of Western Europe--and I believe it will--everything will be all right. We have to proceed in that direction.
