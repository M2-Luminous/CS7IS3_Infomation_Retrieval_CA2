Israel's delegation is headed by Agriculture Ministry Director General Yehonatan Bashi, and the Palestinian delegation is led by Khalid al-Qidrah, a PLO leader in the Gaza Strip, who recently arrived from Tunis. The talks are aimed at working out procedures for agricultural trade between Israel and the autonomy and measures to make ascertain the quality of the agricultural produce entering Israel. There is special concern about the use of pesticides and the health of the animals in the autonomy. Our correspondent notes that even before the talks started it was decided that mutual agricultural trade will take place only if the standards used in Israel are upheld in the autonomy. Our correspondent recalls that under the autonomy agreement, the borders will be opened to free passage of agricultural produce, except for five sectors, in which temporary quotas have been introduced. These are: tomatoes, potatoes, cucumbers, eggs, and spring chickens. There is no doubt that hoof-and-mouth disease, which has recently been uncovered in Jericho, and ways to prevent it from spreading, will undoubtedly come up in the talks.
