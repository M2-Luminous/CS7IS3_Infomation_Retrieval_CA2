According to the Russian Federation foreign minister, the first meeting about Bosnia between the foreign ministers of Russia, the United States and five European Union countries, which was held in Geneva on 13 May, "created a good foundation for peace." This foundation is, first and foremost, "full equality of rights for the peoples of Bosnia-Herzegovina and full equality of choice for the Bosnian Serbs." In the near future "We intend to attempt to hold a second ministerial meeting which will provide an opportunity to reach a very important agreement on this basis, precisely within this framework." By opting for peace, A. Kozyrev continued, the Bosnian Serbs will be able to count on Russia's most resolute support. Among other things, Russia believes that when the territorial issue is decided the Serb people of Bosnia-Herzegovina should hold 49 percent of the territory. History has decreed that although the Serbs form only around 33 percent of the Bosnian population, they are entitled to claim a large and fair slice of territory. When peace is restored, sanctions will be lifted, Yugoslavia will rejoin the "family of nations," and assistance will be given with the rehabilitation of the war-damaged economy. In order to avoid misunderstandings, the Russian minister went on to say, I would also like to issue a clear warning. There is another option, leading to war -- unwillingness to accept reasonable compromises and an intention to hold on to 70 percent of the territory which is now being held by the Bosnian Serb as a result of the war. If you do opt for war -- and we believe that this will not happen -- we must state just as firmly that you will not, in that case, be able to count on Russia. "As real friends, we only support fair play," A. Kozyrev stressed. "Russia will not support injustice."
