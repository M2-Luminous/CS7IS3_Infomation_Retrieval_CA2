Lula attacked the plan in noting that "it foments misery; it overlooks development, the distribution of income, and the creation of jobs; and it funnels social investment funds into the Social Emergency Fund." He also charged the economic team with "interfering in an absurd manner with the Judicial Branch" in asking regional labor courts to refrain from granting compensations for salary losses. Lula said: "The right thing would be to first negotiate with the workers a basic agreement that would not result in losses for them." He also defended his vice presidential candidate, Senator Jose Paulo Bisol (Brazilian Socialist Party), who had proposed amendments to the federal budget that resulted in the allocation of a total of $8.6 million to the municipal government of Buritis (Minas Gerais State), where Bisol has a ranch. Lula said: "It is absurd to criticize a senator for distributing funds to municipalities. This is an entirely normal action." Lula added that Bisol's action "is altogether different" from that of Deputies Joao Alves and Ricardo Fiuza, who were involved in the budget scandal. He said: "Bisol is a friend of the mayor of Buritis. He is not like those two, who allocated funds to municipal governments of their electoral districts."
