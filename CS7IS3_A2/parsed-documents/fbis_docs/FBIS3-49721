Taking part in the talks were, among others, Energy Secretary Boris Sovic; Savo Trepse, duty official of the Slovene Electricity Board; and Ostoj Kristan, director general of the Slovene Electricity Board. After the meeting, Joze Skok interviewed Mr. Kristan: [Begin recording] [Skok] Mr. Kristan, let us first ask the following question: Is neighboring Croatia, or more specifically, its electrical power generation industry, taking the electricity from our network into its system? [Kristan] Well, the two systems are connected and they are synchronically operating [words indistinct]. After we had been told by the nuclear power plant that it is giving us the (?entire) power from the beginning of its operation after the repair, we have made the appropriate programs and sent them to our partners because it was [words indistinct] that they do not get energy from the (?nuclear power plant), certainly not this quantity. As of that time, they have been taking electricity as if one-half belongs to them, therefore they have not been respecting the (?schedule). [Skok] Therefore, we can say that they have been (?taking the electricity) from the very beginning of the work of the nuclear power plant? [Kristan] They are taking the electricity without unauthorization. We are registering this as deviation from the program of operation and are warning them every hour in written form, by a faxed message. [Skok] What quantity, (?that is) for how long the Croatian Electrical Power Generation Industry is [words indistinct] unauthorized seize of electricity? [Kristan] That (?deviation) amounts to (?80) megawatts, which is approximately one-half of the production of the nuclear power plant. This is no technical problem for us, but is certainly a commercial, expense problem. A decision should be made certainly [words indistinct] their reaction. We are going to warn them tomorrow, [words indistinct] stand, to give us back this electricity next week. And if [words indistinct] in interstate relations, the programs will be changed. And if they refuse to give electricity back next week, that is, if that deviation exceeds a bearable level we should certainly take measures with a view to protecting our reserves and our network [end recording]
