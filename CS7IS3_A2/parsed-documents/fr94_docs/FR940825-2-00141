FR940825-2-00141 FR940825-2-00093 The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 6 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the Federal Register in order to allow the Exchange to list without delay ELNs linked to securities (including sponsored ADRs) that are traded in the U.S. securities markets and that are issued by non-U.S. companies subject to U.S. reporting requirements and that satisfy the proposed listing guidelines. Amendment No. 6 provides that ELNs may be linked to equity 30 securities issued by non-U.S. companies and traded in the U.S. as ADRs, ordinary shares, or otherwise, and significantly enhances the existing listing criteria in Sections 107A and 107B of the Guide for ELNs linked to securities issued by U.S. companies. 30 Telephone conversation between Claire McGrath, Managing Director and Special Counsel, Derivative Securities, Amex, and Brad Ritter, Attorney, Office, Division, Commission, on dated July 19, 1994. The Commission believes that broadening the universe of securities that can be linked to ELNs beyond ADRs, as originally proposed, to also include securities traded in the U.S. as ordinary shares or otherwise that are issued by non-U.S. companies subject to U.S. reporting requirements, does not raise any regulatory issues that the Exchange has not adequately addressed with respect to ELNs linked to ADRs. Furthermore, the Commission believes that the enhanced listing criteria proposed in Amendment No. 6 which will apply to ELNs linked to any security issued by a non-U.S. company, combined with the numerical listing standards currently contained in Sections 107A and 107B of the Guide, ensure that the Amex has the ability to detect and deter manipulation with respect to both the ELN and the underlying security. Finally, the Commission believes that Amendment No. 6 conforms the proposed rule change to the procedures approved by the Commission for the listing of options on ADRs. 31 As stated in the ADR Approval Order, the Commission continues to believe that these standards will ensure that the U.S. market is the relevant pricing market for the ELN and the underlying security where there is no comprehensive market information sharing agreement with the primary market for such security (for ADRs, the primary exchange in the country where the security underlying the ADR primarily trades). 32 Accordingly, the Commission believes that good cause exists for approving Amendment No. 6 to the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis. 31 See ADR Approval Order, supra note 13. 32 Id. Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment No. 6. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C.

It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 33 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;Ammex&hyph;93&hyph;46), as amended, is hereby approved. 33 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988).
