Among other things, they will discuss the question of reorganizing the Internal Affairs Ministry. It is worth noting that Yuriy Skokov, Viktor Yerin, and Viktor Ilyushin already held a meeting the other day. According to the source, these consultations may precipitate significant reshuffles at the Internal Affairs Ministry in the near future. In particular, Viktor Yerin's first deputy, Mikhail Yegorov, who is also chief of the Internal Affairs Ministry's Main Administration for the Struggle Against Organized Crime, may be appointed internal affairs minister.
