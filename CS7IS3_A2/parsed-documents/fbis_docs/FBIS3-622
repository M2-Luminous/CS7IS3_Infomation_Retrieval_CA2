The Committee for the Defence of Human Rights (CDHR) said in a statement that leaders of the two neighbouring nations "can and should seek" an amicable solution to the conflict in order to avoid imminent "war that now stares both countries in the face" "We cannot at this time afford to go on a war whose disastrous end no one can predict", the statement said.
