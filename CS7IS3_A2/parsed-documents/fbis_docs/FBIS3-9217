On March 4, 91 state radio employees were dismissed and 38 sent to retirement, including several leading editors and reporters. Opposition parties accuse the government of having given their tacit support for the firings, which also affected a number of journalists known for their oppositional views. The ruling parties have repeatedly stressed the independence of radio leadership in the dismissals, and the government's lack of influence in the decision. Hungarian Radio presently has a workforce of about 2,000. Radio leaders explained the sackings in terms of budgetary constraints. IFJ's fact-finding committee, including first IFJ Vice-President Gustl Glattfelder, British Journalist Trade Union Secretary-General Jacob Ecclestone and Austrian Journalist Federation Vice-President Paul Vecsey, examined the situation at Hungarian Radio. Glattfelder said they have not yet finished the inquiry and will present their report to the IFJ directorate at a later date. However, they summed up recommendations in four points after meeting with Hungarian Radio Vice-President Laszlo Csucs, Prime Minister's Cabinet Chief Endre Marinovich and Prime Minister's Office State Secretary Jozsef Kajdi. The IFJ delegation recommends that the dismissed be returned to their posts; that an ethical code be drawn up and published for the election campaign (the first round of Hungary's parliamentary elections will be held on May 8); that an independent parliamentary committee look into the radio's economic situation; and the new parliament give preference to the drafting of a media law after the elections. Answering questions, Glattfelder said, "It is our belief that the radio employees were dismissed for political reasons."
