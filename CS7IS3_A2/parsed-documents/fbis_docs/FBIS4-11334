The establishment of an embassy for the Eastern Caribbean in Barbados, the normalization of diplomatic relations with Grenada, and the establishment of ties with Antigua and Barbuda helped to close Cuba's diplomatic circle with its closest neighbors. After years of mutual indifference, Cuba and the Lesser Antilles began to pay more attention to each other this decade as a result of the debacle in the socialist camp and the former Soviet Union and the formation of large trade blocs, two events that severely affected the foreign trade of many countries. Deprived of 85 percent of its trade, which consisted of barter agreements and other beneficial agreements with the USSR and the rest of the socialist countries of Eastern Europe, Havana saw the need to promote trade on a lesser scale but with a greater variety of Latin American and Caribbean countries. In fact, relations with the Caribbean Common Market (Caricom) date back to the late seventies. Through agreements with this regional integration organization, hundreds of students from the English-speaking islands studied at Cuban universities. A particular thread of persuasions make up the web of relationships between Cuba and the Anglo-Caribbean, a region that gave ample proof of its independent spirit when four of its most important members -- Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, and Barbados -- established ties with the island in the 1960's and 1970's, during the full enforcement of the OAS prohibition -- instigated by the United States -- that mandated the diplomatic isolation of Cuba in the hemisphere. In bilateral issues, the Caribbean nations were usually cautious and exhibited their well-known British phlegmatic nature -- a product of their colonial heritage -- before establishing ties beyond formalities, at international forums the Antillean group always voted with Cuba. Subjects such as the defense of the Caribbean as a peace zone, condemnation of the use of force anywhere in the world, apartheid in South Africa, and [support for] independence movements, united the Spanish and English-speaking Antilles into a single bloc. On a strictly economic plane, it became obvious Cuba needed to join Caricom, which procrastinated implementing its own decisions for full integration, something that even today lacks a solid basis: free trade, a common currency, and the freedom to travel and to contract labor from among the member states. Some of the smaller states' prevalent fear of a presumed overwhelming predominance of Cuba over the members of the Anglo-Caribbean community gave way to a spirit of cooperation, once it was proven that one side needed regional integration as much as the other. Although Cuba has twice as much territory and people as all of the Caricom countries combined, it is struggling through an economic and financial crisis that forces it to expand as soon as possible into markets by offering its products and services for which, especially in biotechnology and medicine, there is still room in the Caribbean. In addition, an initial obstacle -- how countries which traditionally depend on tourism as a source of income could deal with the take-off of the Cuban tourist trade -- was solved by the admission of Cuba into the Caribbean Tourism Organization (CTO). Wisely, the smaller tourist island paradises in the region -- Jamaica and the Bahamas taking the lead -- decided to share instead of compete against Cuba, when faced with the irreversible reality of the future rebirth of the Pearl of the Caribbean as the area's preferred vacation spot. Branwell Shepherd, a Jamaican businessman whose Salasaventura travel agency has a multi-destination tourism program with the island, told PRENSA LATINA that "once the U.S. blockade against the Cuban Government is lifted, the influx of U.S. tourists will be unstoppable." Under these circumstances, said Shepherd, the rest of the Caribbean nations must be willing to reach mutually beneficial agreements with Cuba, instead of lamenting over something that is inevitable. Sources at the Cuban Institute of Friendship with Peoples (ICAP), which handles most of the donations received by Cuba, revealed that 50 percent of the donations received in 1993 came from the Caribbean countries. "We have raised our voice many times in defense of the smaller countries' right to exist, and have expressed our opinion at international forums. However, we have sometimes neglected our relationship with the Lesser Antilles, our closest neighbors, and this is now one of our most important political priorities," Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina told PRENSA LATINA last November during his tour of seven nations in the area.
