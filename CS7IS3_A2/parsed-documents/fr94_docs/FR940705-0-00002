FR940705-0-00002 FR940705-0-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Commodity Credit Corporation 7 CFR Part 1421 RIN 0560&hyph;AD74 General Price Support Regulations for Grain, Rice, and Oilseeds for 1993 and Subsequent Crop Years AGENCY: Commodity Credit Corporation, USDA. ACTION: Interim rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: This interim rule amends the regulations with respect to the price support loan programs for grains and similarly handled commodities, including oilseeds (canola, mustard seed, rapeseed, safflower seed, soybeans, and sunflower seed), which are conducted by the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) in accordance with the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended (the 1949 Act), and other acts. The amendments made by this interim rule will provide greater clarity, enhance the administration of CCC programs by providing uniformity between CCC price support programs, eliminate obsolete provisions, provide more authority to State and county committees in administering the programs, lessen the administrative actions CCC imposes on producers who violate the loan and loan deficiency payment (LDP) agreements, and correct errors. DATES: Interim rule effective July 5, 1994. Comments must be received on or before August 4, 1994, in order to be assured of consideration. ADDRESSES: Submit comments to Director, Cotton, Grain, and Rice Price Support Division, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), PO Box 2415, Washington, DC 20013&hyph;2415; telephone 202&hyph;720&hyph;7641. Comments received may be inspected between 9 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays, in room 3623, South Agriculture Building, USDA, 14th Street and Independence Avenue, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Margaret Wright, Program Specialist, Cotton, Grain, and Rice Price Support Division, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, USDA, PO Box 2415, Washington, DC 20013&hyph;2415; telephone 202&hyph;720&hyph;8481. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Executive Order 12866 This rule has been determined to be not-significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been reviewed by OMB. Federal Assistance Program The title and number of the Federal Assistance Program, as found in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, to which this rule applies are Commodity Loans and Purchases_10.051. Regulatory Flexibility Act It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is not applicable because the CCC is not required by 5 U.S.C. 553 or any other provision of law to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to the subject matter of these determinations. Environmental Evaluation It has been determined by an environmental evaluation that this action will have no significant impact on the quality of human environment. Executive Order 12372 This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115 (June 24, 1983). Executive Order 12778 This interim rule has been reviewed pursuant to Executive Order 12778. To the extent State and local laws are in conflict with these regulatory provisions, it is the intent of CCC that the terms of the regulations prevail. The provisions of this interim rule are not retroactive. Prior to any judicial action in a court of competent jurisdiction, administrative review under 7 CFR part 780 must be exhausted. Paperwork Reduction Act Public reporting burden for the information collections contained in this regulation with respect to price support programs is estimated to average 15 minutes per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collections of information. The information collections have previously been cleared under the current regulations by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and assigned OMB Nos. 0560&hyph;0087 and 0560&hyph;0129. In accordance with the provisions of 44 U.S.C. 35, the information collection requirements that are revised as a result of this rule will be resubmitted to OMB for review. Comments Since producers are currently making decisions regarding commodities which may be pledged as collateral for CCC price support loans, the provisions of this interim rule are effective upon publication in the Federal Register . Comments are requested, however, and will be taken into consideration when developing the final rule. This interim rule will be scheduled for review so that a final document discussing comments received and any amendments required can be published in the Federal Register as soon as possible. Background The 1949 Act sets forth the statutory authority for CCC price support programs. CCC price support programs are intended to stabilize market prices and provide interim financing to producers to assist in the orderly marketing of eligible commodities. This interim rule amends regulations found at 7 CFR part 1421 to provide rules for administering CCC price support programs for the 1993 and subsequent crop years.
