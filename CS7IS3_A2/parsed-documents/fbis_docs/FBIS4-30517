The embassy first secretary, (Wu Changshui), said China had no objection to legal immigration, but the decision by the New Zealand Government was linked with Chinese internal affair and not in keeping with the facts. He said it was entirely unacceptable to China. Permanent residency status has been given to up to 600 Chinese students who fear going back to China since the 1989 crushing of pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing. The Chinese Students Association in Wellington says it welcomes New Zealand's decision and says it believes the Chinese granted residency will make a part of the contribution to New Zealand's economy and culture.
