The Chinese president said that the current visit by President Ballen will surely help promote the bilateral relations, which have been developing steadily and smoothly since the two established diplomatic ties 14 years ago, especially since President Ballen took office in 1992. The Chinese Government attaches great importance to developing Sino-Ecuadorian ties, and it is willing to make concerted efforts together with the Ecuadorian Government to further promote the relations of friendship and cooperation, especially in trade and economic cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. The Chinese president told the Ecuadorian guests that exchanges between the Chinese Mainland and Taiwan have been developing steadily and the reunification should be realized under the guidance of the principle of "one country, two systems." Jiang expressed his appreciation and thanks to the Ecuadorian Government for its long-term adherence to principles on the establishment of Sino-Ecuadorian diplomatic relations and its "one China" policy. President Ballen said that Ecuador has, as always, supported the cause of China's reunification. Ballen said that he has seen with his own eyes the great achievement that China has made in its economic construction and China's experience is very useful to Ecuador. The Ecuadorian president said that he is confident that through his current visit, friendship and understanding between Ecuador and China, as well as bilateral trade and economic cooperation, will be further enhanced. President Ballen expressed his thanks for China's effective economic assistance to Ecuador over the years. President Jiang said it is very difficult for people of different countries to understand one another, because each nation has its specific geographic location, different cultural background and different levels of economic development and that makes it necessary for leaders of various nations to exchange views frequently with one another so as to promote understanding and eliminate differences. President Ballen agreed with President Jiang's stand. He said that each nation has its specific conditions and that each nation, in dealing with its internal affairs, should adopt ways that fit its conditions instead of copying others. This is what China has done and so it is with Ecuador. During the talks, the two leaders agreed that the two sides have common or similar views regarding many major international and regional issues and that the two share common interests in many areas. The two sides also exchanged views on further strengthening bilateral cooperation in the fields of economy, trade and education. President Ballen invited Jiang to visit Ecuador at his convenience, and Jiang accepted the invitation with pleasure. After the talks, President Jiang and Ballen attended the signing ceremonies of a series of cooperation agreements between China and Ecuador. These agreements included an agreement on economic and technological cooperation between the two governments, an agreement on encouraging and protecting mutual investments, exchange of notes on China's providing general merchandise to ecuador and a cooperation agreement between two petroleum companies of the two countries. Prior to the talks, President Jiang presided over a ceremony to welcome President Ballen. This evening, Jiang hosted a banquet in honor of President Ballen and his party. This afternoon, Chen Muhua, vice-chairman of China's National People's Congress Standing Committee, met with Josefina Villalobos de Duran Ballen, wife of President Ballen. President Ballen arrived in Shanghai on March 18 and arrived here from Xian at noon today.
