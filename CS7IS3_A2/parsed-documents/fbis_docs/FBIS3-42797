According to the official version of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this decree primarily accommodates a package of Russian-American agreements related to reductions in strategic offensive weapons, envisioning, in particular, the provision of technical assistance to Russia in the area of disarmament. Products and transportation vehicles classified as free technical assistance or as those imported or exported temporarily are exempt not only from customs duties and fees but also from licensing. However, this precedent may very well be built on in a quite unexpected manner. In principle, nothing stands in the way of extending the changes in the regimen of tariff and nontariff regulation of foreign trade to the trilateral Russian-Ukrainian-American agreement on Ukrainian missiles which was signed in Moscow during Bill Clinton's recent visit. The essence of the agreement of the three presidents is as follows: Ukraine will ship to Russia the warheads of its missiles; in turn, Russia will deliver to Ukraine nuclear fuel for atomic power stations; the United States, which controls 50 percent of the world uranium market, will expand opportunities for uranium exports from Russia; foreign exchange proceeds from the latter will be split between Russia and Ukraine by way of compensation for their disarmament outlays. The trilateral agreement opens the American uranium market to Russian exports for 20 years. The United States will withdraw its traditional charges of dumping. The liberalization of foreign trade transactions related to disarmament could contribute to the situation where counting on obtaining $12 billion from uranium exports is justified. Ukraine has not been wronged, either. It counts on receiving its share of foreign exchange proceeds, which is estimated to come to $1 billion. Besides, Kiev hopes that pliancy on the issue of START 1 may yield Ukraine another $1.5 billion in credit from the IMF and $700 million from the World Bank. The United States, having bolstered its shaken authority as peacemaker, will also receive quite palpable economic results, acting as an intermediary element in the subsequent resale of the Russian-Ukrainian uranium. At first sight, the cancellation of the licensing of trade within the framework of disarmament, which is envisioned by the government decree, does not in any way fit this broad version. However, the issue is easy to resolve. Russia has already assumed international obligations in the area of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and has joined the international regimen for controlling the exports of relevant materials and technologies within the framework of the so-called English Club, to which 26 country-suppliers of nuclear technology belong. Since compliance with international obligations enjoys priority, the cancellation of licensing does not apply to uranium, whose exports from Russia are controlled by the Ministry of Atomic Energy. The preservation of export control is undoubtedly in the interests of all participants in the trilateral agreement. [begin box] Withdrawal of Nuclear Weapons From Ukraine to Russia --Ukraine has agreed to transfer to Russia no fewer than 200 warheads from the SS-19 and SS-24 missiles within 10 months. Ukraine has 130 and 46 of these missiles, respectively. During the same period of time, all intercontinental missiles located in Ukraine will be deactivated. --Ukraine has undertaken to achieve complete nonnuclear status within seven years (as provided by START 1).
