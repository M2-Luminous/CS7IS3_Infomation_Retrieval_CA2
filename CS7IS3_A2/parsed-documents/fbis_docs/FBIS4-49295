Under the new system, enterprises need no longer get approval from government bodies other than the Industry and Commerce Administration to go into operation. To start an enterprise, an investor need only submit three documents instead of the previous 11. An eligible application will automatically be approved by the Industry and Commerce Administration, which will then issue the business permit and give public notice of the same, official sources said. The new system also attaches no restrictions to an enterprise's business range, except where state monopoly, public security or health are involved. Therefore, no special licenses are necessary, the sources said. They noted that the new system is not yet fully applicable to stock companies, solely state-owned companies or group companies, as it is still in the experimental stage.
