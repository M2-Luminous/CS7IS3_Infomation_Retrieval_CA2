According to a document, signed last February, and the contract, which was discussed by representatives of the two countries in September, Russia is to process 500 tonnes of weapon uranium over a period of twenty years. This uranium, after proper treatment, will be delivered to the United States as fuel for that country's nuclear power plants in amounts worth twelve billion U.S. dollars. Russia will use the obtained money for switching its defence enterprises to civilian rails, enhancing the safety of its nuclear power plants, supporting fundamental sciences, and cleaning the environment in polluted areas. Moreover, the Russian Ministry for Atomic Energy expects the participants of the summit to sign an agreement allocating 75 million U.S. dollars to Russian organisations from the Nunn-Lugar Fund. They will be used to build storages for weapon plutonium. The point in question is an additional allocation of 75 millions, preliminarily negotiated by the Russian Ministry for Atomic Energy and the U.S. Defence Department to pay for the work done by building organisations, to grant subsidies to the region, where the storages will be held, and also to finance social requirements. Two such storages are to be built in Russia -- one in Tomsk region and the other in Chelyabinsk region. The Ministry for Atomic Energy is looking forward to U.S. assistance in the construction of one of these storages. The construction of the other one will be financed by Russia. Russian specialists also believe that the presidents of the two countries will discuss the earlier signed agreements and will conclude other bilateral agreements on new areas of cooperation in using atomic energy for peaceful purposes. These areas include nuclear power sources for space vehicles, joint efforts of Russian and American weapon laboratories to develop more effective procedures and technological means for the system of the International Atomic Energy Agency's guarantees against the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies.
