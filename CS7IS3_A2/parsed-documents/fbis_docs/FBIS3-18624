Expressing regret at recent comments by James Molyneaux, Mr Spring, leader of the UUP [Ulster Unionist Party], told the Dail [parliament] yesterday he did not believe a strictly internal solution to the Northern problem would work. The most likely result of such an approach would be to marginalise the role and influence of the leaders of the Unionist community, at a time which could be of considerable importance for the future of the island. He hoped those leaders would reflect very carefully on their position. "Their rightful place is at the negotiating table. Recent opinion polls suggest that is where their own electorate, as well as the two Governments, wish to see them." Replying to Fine Gael leader John Bruton, the Tanaiste stressed that no party had a veto on the resumption of the three-stranded talks process. Both Governments were working towards a framework to set out a basis for these talks. He hoped very sincerely that electoral considerations would not prompt any modification of the generally constructive line the Official Unionists had taken over the Downing Street Declaration. This agreement was far too important to allow it to be exploited by political manoeuvering in the context of the European elections. Mr Bruton stressed the importance of the Government making contact with the Unionists to dissuade them from pursuing what the Taoiseach [prime minister] had aptly called a cul-de-sac. The Government should table proposals on strands 2 and 3 of the talks process to dispel suspicions -- wrongly held, he believed -- in the North that Dublin was not really serious about these strands. The Tanaiste replied that efforts had been made over the last year to build up a relationship with the Unionist parties because of the important role they had to play in determining the future of this island. The Government would do everything possible, including the handing over of papers setting out their ideas for solution to the problem, to ensure that any doubts on the part of those in the Unionist community were ended. He would be holding further discussions soon with the Northern Secretary on how the talks process could be advanced. Mr Spring will meet Sir Patrick Mayhew informally in Dublin tomorrow ahead of a full session of the Anglo-Irish Conference in London next Thursday [10 March].
