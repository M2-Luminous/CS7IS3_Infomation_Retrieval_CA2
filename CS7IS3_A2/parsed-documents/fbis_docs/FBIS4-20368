The annual deficit was roughly between $2.1 and 3.7 billion for the first seven years of the 1980's, but has soared dramatically since 1987. It rose from $4.862 billion in 1987 to $9.7 billion in 1991. The figure nearly doubled in five years, averaging a 39.8 percent increase annually. Calculated on the basis of the 1991 figure, which was already high, the 1992 deficit surged further by more than 24 percent. As for 1993, Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan for the first 11 months already totaled $12.9 billion. An estimate made by Taiwan's "Board of Foreign Trade" puts the whole year's deficit at $14 billion, which is a new record high, standing 8.5 percent above the $12.9 billion deficit registered in 1992. Over the past few years, the Taiwan authorities have left no stone unturned to solve the trade deficit with Japan. To explore new markets, Taiwan's "Ministry of Economic Affairs" formed a "Commission for Reduction of the Trade Deficit With Japan" in early 1993. Since then, several Taiwan commodity sales exhibitions have been held in Japan, and delegations have been sent there for sales promotion purposes. Other actions taken include establishing the Taiwan Trade Center and the Joint After-Sale Service Center in Japan, requesting Japanese manufacturers in Taiwan to sell their products back to their home country, diversifying sources of imports, and removing trade barriers. With respect to industrial structural adjustment, the Taiwan authorities have adopted seven measures, namely, assisting industries in raising their product quality, helping improve industrial designs, strengthening the central-and-satellite-plant system, beefing up quality control and inspection, encouraging manufacturers to develop their own technology and make key parts and components independently, actively introducing advanced technology from abroad, and promoting investment. In implementing the above measures, the "Industrial Development Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs" in Taiwan has, among other things, energetically promoted the production of 66 key products, parts, and components to ensure the independence of the island's industry and free it from Japan's control in a bid to radically solve the trade deficit problem. The results are not so effective, however. What is noteworthy is the relations of trade between Taiwan on the one hand and Japan, the United States, and the Chinese mainland on the other. Generally speaking, in the mid-1980's, Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan was offset by its trade surplus with the United States. When the trade deficit with Japan increased, the trade surplus with the United States generally went up; that is, they changed directly with each other. In those years, Taiwan's exports to the United States rose with its increased imports from Japan. After 1987, Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan continued to climb each year, but its trade surplus with the United States kept declining, except for a slight pickup in 1989. In 1993, Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan continued to surge sharply while there was only a slight upturn in its trade with the United States. In contrast, Taiwan's direct trade with Hong Kong and indirect trade with the mainland both shot up considerably. In 1992 the total of these two trade sectors reached $17.2 billion, accounting for over 12 percent of Taiwan's external trade. The trade surplus with Hong Kong and the mainland that year totaled $13.6 billion, way above the $7.8 billion surplus with the United States. As of the end of November 1993, Taiwan's trade surplus with Hong Kong and the mainland already reached $15 billion, up 23.9 percent over the corresponding period of the preceding year. That was roughly 2.5 times the $6.3 billion surplus registered with the United States for January-November 1993. It is estimated that the 1993 trade surplus with Hong Kong and the mainland will exceed $16.5 billion. As can be seen, Taiwan's trade surplus with Hong Kong and the mainland in the 1990's has been approximately equivalent to its trade deficit with Japan, playing a key role in maintaining Taiwan's overall trade balance. The State of Over-Reliance on Japan Cannot Be Changed Shortly Economic and trade relations between Taiwan and Japan are centered on vertical international division of labor. Japan is moving overseas its industries and enterprises with decreasing comparative profits, whereas Taiwan's economic and other conditions are suited to the acceptance of such Japanese industries and technologies. This has resulted in Taiwan's sizable trade deficit with Japan and the relatively large amount of Japanese investment on the island. From 1952 to December 1991, Japan's direct investment in Taiwan was $4.2 billion, accounting for 32.7 percent of the direct investment the island received from overseas. During this period, Japan made 2,181 technology transfers to Taiwan, or 60.4 percent of the technology transfers Taiwan received from abroad--an indication of Taiwan's heavy reliance on Japanese technology. After the third post-war surge in its overseas investment in the mid-1980's, however, the share of Japan's investment in Taiwan in its total overseas investment has been declining. In 1985, Japan's investment in Taiwan accounted for 1.19 percent of its direct overseas investment, which totaled $12.2 billion. In 1989, its direct overseas investment surged to $67.5 billion, while only 0.95 percent of this amount was invested in Taiwan. In other words, while its overseas investment expanded 5.5 times, the share of its investment in Taiwan dropped 20 percent. The first half of 1993 saw only 29 new Japanese investment projects in Taiwan, with a 60 percent drop in the total investment amount compared with the record registered a year ago. Technological cooperation projects numbered only 39, down by 20 percent from the 1992 record. As can be seen, the Taiwan authorities' policy of absorbing Japanese technology to upgrade the island's industry has not produced any appreciable results. On the surface, Japan's investment and technological cooperation projects have enabled Taiwan manufacturers to purchase more raw materials, spare parts, machinery, and equipment from Japan. Moreover, while Taiwan is changing its economic mode, high-tech enterprises on the island have to rely more on Japan for the supply of parts and components for making high-tech products. On the other hand, most of the export products made with Japanese technology, materials, parts, and components are not sold back to Japan, but are destined for European and American countries. This is why Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan has become greater each year. A radical analysis reveals that the development and structure of economic and trade relations between Taiwan and Japan are principally subject to the following factors: Firstly, as far as Taiwan's economic and industrial structures are concerned, small and medium-sized enterprises are the main producers of export products. Many of them are original-equipment manufacturers (OEM) for big Japanese companies, which manipulate their raw material supply and sales channels. Under such circumstances, these small and medium-sized enterprises can hardly free themselves from the Japanese companies' control. Given the current technological and industrial conditions in Taiwan, there are two reasons for Taiwanese manufacturers to choose Japan instead of any other country for their OEM operation: Either the Japanese products are of good quality or they are more competitive in price. It may be said that Taiwan-Japan economic and trade relations are founded on the comparative advantage of international division of labor necessitated by industrial development. Such relations can give some benefits to both sides within a certain period of time. Secondly, the Japanese market is of a closed nature, which is seldom seen in Western economic systems. Its quality and specification requirements and the inspection system are almost overcritical, and its marketing process and practice are highly intricate. Certainly, without a thorough knowledge of the Japanese market and a sufficient strength, it will be difficult to enter into that market. What is more, most of the Japanese companies doing business or making investment in Taiwan are aimed at exploiting the local market or using Taiwan as a place to manufacture or process their products to be sold to the United States. They are different from those American investment projects in Taiwan whose products are by and large sold back to the United States. Such being the case, it is, of course, inevitable for a double imbalance to exist between the two countries--Taiwan suffers a trade deficit with Japan, and Japan's investment in Taiwan far exceeds Taiwan's investment in that country. Thirdly, in the field of science and technology, Taiwan's research and development are still at a relatively low level and cannot form a foundation for upgrading its industry. As Taiwan has been inclined to follow Japan's example in every aspect of its post-war economic development, it still relies on technology imports from Japan even today. Taiwan manufacturers import from Japan a sizable portion of their raw materials, parts, components, machinery, and equipment for making products to be exported. Take the electronics industry as an example. Taiwan's export of electronics amounted to some $18 billion in 1991, ranking the sixth in the world. However, it should be noted that Taiwan's electronics design and manufacturing capabilities are still rather inadequate despite its 30 years of development efforts and the decision made in 1982 by the authorities to designate the electronics industry as a "strategic industry." Of the parts and components required by the electronics industry, only a fraction is made domestically. For the industry's downstream sector, over 80 percent of the parts and components have to be imported, especially from Japan. As a striking example, over 90 percent of Taiwan's requirement for integrated circuits--an essential component for information electronics--is met by imports. Taiwan's economic development is not accompanied by the optimization of the entire economy, nor is it a process associated with a gradual progress in science and technology. Instead, it is a quantitatively expanding profit-making process through continuous absorption, but not digestion, of foreign technology and capital to make products for export. This process has resulted in the present pattern of economic and trade relations between Taiwan and Japan. Despite the Environmental Change, the Prospect Is Not Optimistic Taiwan's industry is in the course of upgrading. Industrial upgrading and product updating will certainly boost the demands for new technology, equipment, parts, and components. In recent years, over 80 percent of Taiwan's imports from Japan are machinery, equipment, and various parts and components. Such imports are prerequisites for Taiwan's survival and development. Meanwhile, Taiwan has adopted the following measures to improve its economic and trade relations with Japan: 1) exploring markets in Japan for Taiwanese goods so as to cut trade deficit; 2) adjusting industrial structure to reduce reliance on Japan; and 3) improving the status of export-processing zones, diversifying markets, and exploring new sources of technology and equipment through "liberalization and internationalization" measures. Development of Taiwan-Japan economic and trade relations are affected by the following external factors: In the first place, it is affected by the slowdown of economic growth of Western developed countries. According to forecast by international organizations and research institutes, the economic growth rates of the seven major Western developed countries for the 1990's will be lower than the 1980's. During the late 1980's and the early 1990's, Japan's economic situation is that following a 4.6 percent growth rate in 1988, a rather quick growth was scored in 1990, pushing the growth rate to 5.2 percent. In 1991, however, the economic growth rate fell to 3.3 percent. Following that, the growth rate is expected to remain at a level below 4 percent, as forecast by most people. This provides a favorable condition for Taiwan to import Japan's technology and equipment to meet its industrial-upgrading requirements. But the negative effect is that Taiwan will encounter hard-to-overcome obstacles in exploring markets in Japan. Secondly, the acceleration of global economic regionalization will also have some impact on Taiwan-Japan economic and trade relations. Progress in building a Single European Market and the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement have made it a general trend of the times that countries of the central Pacific-Asia region want to cooperate in checking and balancing the control and blockade imposed upon them by European and American countries. For this reason, both Taiwan and Japan have deliberately strengthened their ties, adjusted their bilateral relations, made a number of proposals, and sent delegations to visit each other from time to time in a bid to reinforce and improve their economic and trade relations. In addition, the 1990's will witness the acceleration of science and technology advance in the world. Accordingly, the international diffusion of technology will also become faster. Based on its relatively large foreign exchange reserve and fairly sound economic and technological foundation, Taiwan will speed up the absorption of advanced technology from abroad. It will become a major potential recipient that Japan will consider for further accelerating nonsophisticated technology transfers in the Pacific-Asia region. From the above it follows that before Taiwan completes its industrial upgrading, there will be no radical change in its unfavorable trade balance with Japan. Because of its limited market capacity, however, Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan will slide down slowly after attaining a certain level. What is worth mentioning is that the two sides of the Taiwan Straits, with their increasing contacts, will enter a new phase of economic and trade relations in the late 1990's. Escalation of their economic cooperation will assist Taiwan in upgrading its industry, thereby reducing its reliance on Japan.
