Ricupero recommended: "People sometimes get more emotional over the forest because it is more spectacular. We also want industrialized nations to give the same attention to arid and semi-arid areas." Ricupero participated on 9 March in the opening ceremony of the Latin American Seminar on Desertification. The minister today will propose to Bo Kjellen, the Desertification Convention Negotiations Intergovernmental Committee chairman, to avoid implementing an approach "merely based on providing assistance" and provide support for the development of the population living in the areas affected by this problem. Ricupero noted: "Even though we admit that the priority is Africa, the most affected continent, we want the donating countries' commitment to Latin America to be mandatory." According to Ricupero, overcoming desertification in Latin America will require expenditures totaling $2 billion. The minister said the outcome of the National Conference on Desertification, which ended on 9 March, will manifest to our country "a problem of which the people have thus far been unaware" and yield contributions for the National Antidesertification Program. Ricupero said: "We want to define this policy, which does not exist yet in either Brazil or most Latin American countries, with the exception of Mexico." Delegates from the interested countries have to draw up a proposal for Latin America by 11 March.
