FR940927-0-00035 FR940927-0-00004 Compliance With Executive Orders 12612, 12778, and 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq.), and the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Ch. 35) This rule was not reviewed under Executive Order 12866. SBA certifies that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. This rule is necessary to resolve a possible discrepancy between the Small Business Act and SBA's size regulations concerning the size eligibility of certain nonmanufacturers for small business set aside and section 8(a) contracts. It will have no significant effect, however, on the amount or dollar value of any contract requirement or the number of requirements set aside for small business or the 8(a) program. As such, it is not likely to have an annual economic effect of $100 million or more, result in a major increase in costs or prices, or have a significant adverse effect on competition or the United States economy. For purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. Ch. 35, SBA certifies that this final rule contains no new reporting or record keeping requirements. For purposes of Executive Order 12612, SBA certifies that this rule does not have any federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For purposes of Executive Order 12778, SBA certifies that this rule is drafted, to the extent practicable, in accordance with the standards set forth in Section 2 of that Order.
