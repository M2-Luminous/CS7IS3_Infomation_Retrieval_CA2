The claims also encompass all private debts. The claims by the United States are correct based on the view that the new government should inherit all the legacies from old governments. Logically, however, the United States' demands appear to be totally unreasonable. It is widely known that the Polpotists seized all private assets, whether or not they were owned by U.S. or Cambodian individuals or any other countries. It is widely agreed that the current government cannot be accountable for what the Khmer Rouge clique seized. The Khmer Rouge pulled themselves out of the UN-organized peace process. They should be asked to pay for private property they destroyed. If Washington is determined to claim compensation, it would only be diplomatic excess. Moreover, it is worth noting that what happened in Saigon and what happened in Phnom Penh after 1975 were completely different -- the communists who confiscated private assets in Cambodia have already been outlawed, a situation completely different from that in Vietnam. [passage omitted] The United States should forget about compensation claims from Cambodia as it has done with other Third World countries. What the Cambodian people want to see from the United States is its determination to make a success of the international conference on the reconstruction of Cambodia to be held in Tokyo, Japan, on 10 and 11 March 1994, according to the wish of Cambodia, one of the poorest countries of the world.
