A number of businessmen mingled with Arab and French diplomats and political leaders, mostly of the RPR [Rally for the Republic] or associated groups. In total, some 50 guests attended what looked very much like a gathering of "Gaullists," nostalgic for "France's Arab policy," including former representatives of companies in Iraq who have been silent since the Gulf crisis. Now "attitudes are changing. This evening proves it," according to one of the organizers. The visit to France by an Iraqi parliamentary delegation provided the opportunity for a dinner-cum-debate. A deputy from the Baghdad Parliament sat in the room, as did the representative of the Iraqi interests section in Paris, al-`Azzawi [name as transliterated]. The invitation was issued by the Fifth Republic Christian Movement (MCVe), whose chairman is Michel Grimard. The organization is closely associated with Jacques Chirac's RPR. When he invaded Kuwait in August 1990 Saddam Husayn fell into an American "ambush," the assembled company was told by Roselyne Bachelot, the RPR's deputy for Maine et Loire. "It is certain now that Baghdad received assurances from the highest diplomatic level that the United States would not oppose their troops' crossing the border." The deputy, who is chairwoman of the National Assembly's France-Iraq group, developed the conspiracy theory at some length before demanding "the opening as soon as possible of an economic interests section in Baghdad, the release of Iraq assets held in French banks for the purchase of food and pharmaceuticals supplies, and a more flexible policy on visas." In solemn tones, Paul Depis, a former ambassador to Baghdad, recalled the golden years of Franco-Iraqi cooperation. French enterprises "invested 130-150 billion francs" from 1973 through 1989. Above all, he said, by advancing beyond the Euphrates, France succeeded in encroaching on "a British reserve." Having long been in the minority, the advocates of a new Paris-Baghdad axis -- if not political, then at least economic -- can now count on the support of part of the Balladur government. Thus Daniel Garrigue, another RPR deputy, expressed satisfaction with France's action within the UN Security Council. For the first time since the Gulf crisis, its representative in New York on 17 March publicly opposed the United States and Britain over the renewal of the international sanctions against Iraq. As it does every two months, the United Nations had to renew the oil and military embargo and the measures to freeze Iraqi assets abroad. This time Paris, backed by China and Russia, urged that recognition be given for the "progress made by Baghdad." The destruction of its chemical, nuclear, and biological weapons is being completed. The long-term monitoring of Iraq's arsenal of death is being established. According to French diplomats, these "efforts" deserve to be encouraged. The United Nations is giving itself six months in which to establish an adequate surveillance system. France is pleading for the lifting of the oil embargo as soon as this trial period is over. It accuses its former allies of trying to impose on Iraq conditions not envisaged by the UN documents. The English [as published] and British consider this too short a time and are refusing to grant Baghdad a blank check. They maintain that Saddam Husayn is simply trying to allay suspicion. He has not recognized the new line of the Iraqi-Kuwait border and is still violating human rights. [passage omitted] Sa'di Mahdi Salih, speaker of the Iraqi Parliament, welcomes France's new stance. The Balladur government "can persuade the other sides, including the United States and Britain, to lift the embargo," he told us Friday [25 March]. Western diplomats do not fear a French defection, but do consider the policy a dangerous one, "because it threatens to mislead the Iraqis into believing that the Western camp has weakened." Already on the eve of the UN vote, Saddam Husayn adopted a louder tone and massed troops near Iraqi Kurdistan, in the belief that he could thus bring pressure to bear on the Security Council.
