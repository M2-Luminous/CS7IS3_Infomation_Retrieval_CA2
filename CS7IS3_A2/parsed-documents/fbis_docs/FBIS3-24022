The trend in the slump in the gross national product and national income continues, although some slowing down in its rate has been noted. Difficulties with material-technical supplies, the disruption in economic relations, the continuous increase in prices, and the insolvency of enterprises have led to a further drop in industrial production. The slow process in destatization did not give positive results. A reduction in production occurred at enterprises of almost all forms of property, except collective, but its negligible proportion had no effect on the results of the work of all of industry. While in the first half year of 1993, the rates of cuts in production slowed down somewhat, in the second half of the year the slump in production intensified and for the whole year exceeded 7 percent. Labor productivity fell by 3 percent. Every second enterprise reduced the volume of production of products compared to last year. The biggest slump in production was in enterprises of the oil refining, chemical and petrochemical, and coal industries, in ferrous metallurgy, the building materials industry, and in light industry. The intensification of crisis phenomena in industry is connected in some measure with the reduction in production volumes in the fuel-energy complex. The extraction of the basic types of fuel in a standard calculation was reduced for the year by 12 percent. The extraction of oil and gas condensate was less by 5 percent, coal--by 13 percent, including coke--by 17 percent, and gas--by 8 percent. As a result of a decrease in extraction and a reduction in imported deliveries, the volumes of refined oil decreased by 15 million tonnes, or by 39 percent, and, as a consequence, the output of motor vehicle gas was cut by 35 percent (1.9 million tonnes), diesel fuel by 24 percent (2 million tonnes), mazut fuel by 40 percent (7 million tonnes). The shortage of fuel affected the volumes of production of electric power--at thermal electric power stations whose share in the total development of electric power exceeds 60 percent. For the year, the thermal power stations cut the production of electric power by 16 percent, as a result of which its total output decreased by 9 percent. At the same time, more electric power was produced by nuclear and hydroelectric power stations (by 2 and 39 percent, respectively) than in 1992. The tense situation with the production and supply of fuel-energy resources had a negative effect on other branches of industry, and especially on metallurgy, one of the most fuel and energy-consuming industries. By comparison with the 1992 level, the production of all of the main types of products of industry decreased. Production was cut in nonferrous metallurgy enterprises, in the chemical industry, in machine building, and in the building materials industry. The situation remained difficult in agriculture in 1993. At the same time, some symptoms of its stabilization appeared. The rates of reduction in the production of agricultural products were reduced substantially. The volume of gross products in comparison with the previous year decreased only by 2 percent, and, at the same time, plant-growing products increased by 7 percent. Farms of all categories produced 45.6 million tonnes of grain in weight after processing, which is 18.3 percent more than in 1992; sugar beets (factory)--33.6 million tonnes (by 16.8 percent); potatoes--20.9 million tonnes (by 3.3 percent more); vegetables--5.8 million tonnes (10.1 percent more); and sunflowers--2.2 million tonnes (at the level of the previous year). The situation in livestock raising remains acute. Sovkhozes and collective and interfarm agricultural enterprises in 1993 produced 2.6 million tonnes of meat in live weight, which is 23 percent less than in 1992; 11.6 million tonnes of milk (by 10 percent less); 6.1 billion eggs of all types (by 18 percent less). The production of livestock products in subsidiary farms of the population increased. A negative trend in the reduction of the total number of cattle and a drop in its productivity in the public sector continued. Capital construction during the report period was characterized by an imbalance between investment programs and the financial capabilities for their implementation in connection with the continuous increase in prices for building materials and energy sources. Because of inadequate financing (in the main), the start-up program for putting important production and environmental protection facilities into operation was not implemented. Out of 343 facilities that were included by name in Ukraine's 1993 state contract, only one-sixth were put into operation, of which almost a fourth were only partially implemented. A further worsening occurred in 1993 in the condition of national economic and passenger transportation by all types of transport of the country. During 1993, the unbalance of state finances became more pronounced. According to preliminary data of the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine, the consolidated budget of Ukraine for the year came to a deficit of 7.9 trillion karbovantsy, which constituted 6.8 percent with respect to the gross domestic product. There was an expenditure from the budget for the national economy of 12.6 trillion karbovantsy, or 21.8 percent of all expenditures; for defense--2.8 trillion karbovantsy, or 4.9 percent; for administration--3 trillion karbovantsy, or 5.2 percent, and the expenditures associated with the elimination of the aftereffects of the Chernobyl catastrophe totaled 1.8 trillion karbovantsy, which is 0.7 trillion karbovantsy less than the payments to this fund. The deficit of the state budget for 1993 totaled 10.3 trillion karbovantsy, and in December alone it increased by 2.9 trillion karbovantsy, or by 39 percent. Expenditures for the social protection of the population made up a substantial share of the expenditures of the state budget--37.4 percent of all expenditures. The volumes of credit investments of the banking system in the national economy for 1 January 1994 totaled 54 trillion karbovantsy. The emission of money for the year increased by a factor of 25 and totaled 12.3 trillion karbovantsy. The monetary incomes of the population totaled 65.7 trillion karbovantsy. The expenditures of the population totaled 54.2 trillion karbovantsy. The wages of the workers of the state sector of the economy for last year increased almost by a factor of 50 and in December 1993 totaled 793,000 karbovantsy, as compared to 16,000 in the corresponding month of 1992. The average monthly wage of kolkhoz workers increased for the year by a factor of 29.5 and totaled 106,000 karbovantsy. The level of inflation rose significantly in 1993. Prices for consumer goods and paid services increased by more than a factor of 100. The labor resources of Ukraine in 1993 totaled more than 29 million persons. A total of 557,500 temporarily unemployed citizens were registered with the state employment service. For 1993, 11 billion karbovantsy were expended from the population employment assistance fund for unemployment benefits. The size of the population of Ukraine on 1 January 1994 was 52.135 million persons, and it decreased in comparison with 1993 by 0.2 percent, or by 109,000 persons. More than one-fourth of the entire population of Ukraine consists of pensioners, whose number is increasing every year. The government has undertaken measures for the social protection of the population. The crime-conducive situation has remained difficult. The number of crimes registered by organs of Internal Affairs exceeded the level of 1992 by 12 percent and totaled 539,300 cases; every fourth registered crime is grave. An extremely tense situation, conditioned by a sharp decrease in the output of commodities, has developed in the consumer market. For the year they were produced in the amount of 74 trillion karbovantsy at wholesale factory prices, which is 16.5 percent less than in 1992. In 1993, the quality composition of the food ration of the population deteriorated. The consumption of meat and meat products was only 46 kilograms, which is less in comparison with the previous year by 7 kilograms, milk and milk products--275 kilograms (less by 10 kilograms), eggs--193 each (less by 34 eggs), fish and fish products--3.2 kilograms (less by 4.1 kilograms), sunflower oil--8 kilograms (less by 2.6 kilograms), sugar--39 kilograms (6 kilograms less). There was an increase in the consumption of bakery products, potatoes, fruit, berries, grapes, vegetables, and melons and gourds. * * * Seventy-one stock exchanges were established in the republic, and 41 were conducting practical activity. The volumes of concluded agreements on the exchanges totaled 313 billion karbovantsy, which is more than in 1992 by a factor of almost 10. The growth was due mainly to high prices for food products, commodities, and services. According to preliminary data, the volume of the foreign trade turnover of Ukraine with countries that were formed on the territory of the former USSR for 1993 totaled 58.8 trillion karbovantsy, including exports--20.7 trillion karbovantsy and imports--38.1 trillion karbovantsy, which resulted in a negative balance in foreign trade of 17.4 trillion (mainly owing to payments for natural gas, oil, and oil products), including with the Russian Federation--12.6 trillion. The Russian Federation has the biggest share in the foreign trade turnover of Ukraine with states of the former USSR--75 percent. In the second half of 1993, the process of destatization of the property of industrial enterprises accelerated somewhat. The proportion of enterprises of a nonstate form of property in the overall number of enterprises increased to 32 percent, as compared with 25 percent in 1992. These enterprises produced output for 47 trillion karbovantsy, or 29 percent of the total volume of products. The process of the destatization of enterprises in the sphere of services is continuing. The number of leased enterprises of everyday services of the population is increasing. The process of privatization of the state housing fund has started and has picked up considerable speed.
