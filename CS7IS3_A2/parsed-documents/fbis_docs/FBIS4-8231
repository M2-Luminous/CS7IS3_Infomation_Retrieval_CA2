The federal government sharply condemned the United Nations' decision to use NATO's air force, which amounts to its direct involvement in the civil war in former Bosnia-Herzegovina on the Muslim side, a statement by the Federal Ministry of Information said. The federal government particularly stressed that the United Nations did this without having fulfilled the assumed obligation of demilitarizing the Muslim army in Gorazde. Furthermore, it tolerated the planning and carrying out of Muslim offensive military operations launched from the protected area against Serb positions in the Gorazde area. Only when the Muslim spring offensive was defeated did the United Nations remember that Gorazde was a protected area and asked NATO fighter-planes to launch strikes against the Serb side under attack. It is regrettable that the United Nations, which is obliged by the Charter to preserve peace and international security, took steps that put in jeopardy the peace process and caused the escalation of the war. By taking such biased and war-mongering positions, the United Nations has seriously discredited its reputation as a peace-making force in former Bosnia-Herzegovina, and has assumed responsibility for all consequences of a possible further uncontrollable development. By acting as a side involved in the conflict, the United Nations has set a dangerous precedent, which can have far-reaching implications. The federal government stresses that the way out of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina should not be based on a policy of double standards, and on the world organization [UN] and other factors siding with any of the three warring sides in the civil war there, but on the same treatment of all three warring sides, as well as on unbiased and unselfish contributions to the peace process. Any deviation from this principle only boosts the Muslim side in its belief that by stubbornly obstructing peace efforts and continuing military hostilities it can win the civil war and impose the concept of a united Bosnia-Herzegovina. The federal government calls on the United Nations to immediately abandon the irresponsible and dangerous policy of getting involved in the war on the side of the Muslims and to fight against the war and fight for its unconditional, immediate, and lasting end by pursuing peace rather than war. By consistently pursuing its principled and peaceful policies in resolving the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will continue to provide support for all constructive efforts to reduce the present tensions and to bring an end to the hostilities, and to a just and comprehensive political solution to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. On this occasion, the federal government draws attention to the solidarity of all citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with the Serb people in the Srpska republic who are victims of the latest aggression, the Federal Ministry for Information says in its statement.
