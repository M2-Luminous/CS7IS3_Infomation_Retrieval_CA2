Knesset Speaker Shevah Weiss has decided to refer the matter to the Knesset's legal adviser. The Likud statement, calling for a continued Israeli presence on the Golan, was defeated by one vote, but four opposition MK's [Knesset Members] said their votes were not registered even though they pressed the correct button in the electronic vote. Now Knesset Speaker Shevah Weiss says he is willing to hold the vote again next week, if both sides agree, but as David Ze'ev reports, the Likud wants him to change the result without a revote. [Begin Ze'ev recording] Likud caucus chairman Moshe Qatzav says he is considering going to the High Court if House Speaker Shevah Weiss does not reverse the outcome of the plenum vote on the statement over the future of the Golan Heights. The coalition declaration of the Labor party and the Meretz bloc at the end of the Golan debate was endorsed without controversy. It said simply that the Knesset registers before it the government's position on the Golan Heights as stated by Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur earlier in the debate. But the statement by the opposition -- Likud, Tzomet, and the National Religious Party -- borrows terminology from the Labor platform, a move to embarrass the government. It calls for maintaining an Israeli military and settlement presence on the Golan. It failed by one vote, but four opposition MK's say their votes were not registered, and, in fact, on the Knesset computer sheet their names do not appear. [passage omitted] There are two issues at stake. One is a Knesset rule which says that the House speaker must change the result of a vote accordingly if Knesset members inform him of a problem after the voting procedure has been completed. That is the point emphasized by the Likud's Moshe Qatzav, who says the House speaker is distorting the will of the Knesset. But the speaker counters with what he says is the dangerous precedent that would be established if MK's start complaining that the computerized voting system sometimes gives the wrong result.
