During a full session of the CPPCC National Committee today, Zhou Shaozheng, chairman of the CPPCC subcommittee for handling proposals, delivered a report on the handling of proposals made since the last session a year ago. Over the past year, members of the CPPCC National Committee, various democratic parties and people's organizations have made a total of 1,981 proposals, he said, adding that his subcommittee had handled 99 percent of the proposals by February 25, 1994. He said that 1,506 members, 72 percent of the total, made proposals in 1993. Of these, 13 came from the Central Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, and groups of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Jiu San (September 3) Society and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. According to Zhou, 673 of these proposals, or 35.4 percent, deal with China's economic development; 617 of these, or 32.5 percent, involve education, science, culture, public health and sports; 394 of these, or 20.7 percent, cover political affairs, legal affairs, labor and personnel; and the rest deal with united front work, nationality affairs, religious affairs, and affairs relating to Hong Kong and Macao compatriots and Overseas Chinese. All the proposals made during the first session of the CPPCC National Committee, held a year ago, have been submitted to departments of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and the State Council for handling, he said. To date, those departments have either adopted or handled 82 percent of these proposals in various ways and have also explained why they cannot adopt the remaining, he said. He said that a considerable part of the proposals contain specific measures to accelerate reforms, open China wider to the outside world, step up the modernization drive, push forward the establishment of a socialist market economic structure, promote ideological and cultural progress, and improve the party's style of work and the building of a clean and honest government. For example, members made a number of proposals calling for increased investment in agriculture and faster construction of large water conservancy facilities. There are nine proposals requiring the undertaking of a massive project to divert water from south China to water-deficient north China. The State Planning Commission has listed diverting Chang Jiang River water to north China as a priority project and is now making a feasibility study of it, he said. Many members also proposed setting fair and rational tax rates and establishing a new rational taxation system throughout China. The party Central Committee and the State Council have decided to institute a tax assignment system since the beginning of this year, in an effort to tighten the central government's unified management of tax revenues, he said. Moreover, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress has adopted a proposal suggesting that an amendment to China's constitution provide for the establishment of a "multi-party cooperation and political consultative system under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party." The stipulation "a multi-party cooperation and political consultative system will exist for a long time to come and develop" has been included in China's constitution, he added. Zhou Shaozheng pledged to handle proposals by CPPCC National Committee members more efficiently in future.
