FR940926-0-00009 FR940926-0-00004 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION 10 CFR Part 110 RIN 3150&hyph;AE31 Specific Licensing of Exports of Certain Alpha-Emitting Radionuclides and Byproduct Material AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its regulations to establish specific licensing controls on the export of bulk tritium, transuranic isotopes americium-242m, californium-249, californium-251, curium-245, curium-247, and certain specified alpha-emitting radionuclides; revise and establish new general licenses for tritium and the specified alpha-emitting radionuclides which are keyed to the recipient country's membership in the Nuclear Suppliers Group; remove Argentina, Brazil, and Chile from the list of restricted destinations; and revise the general license for exports of Canadian-origin uranium. The amendments are necessary to conform the export controls of the United States to international export control guidelines and a treaty obligation of the U.S. under the U.S.-Canada Agreement for Cooperation. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 10, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Elaine Hemby, Office of International Programs, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, telephone (301) 504&hyph;2341. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On March 17, 1993 (58 FR 14344), the NRC published in the Federal Register a proposed rule that would amend NRC's regulations in 10 CFR Part 110 pertaining to the export of nuclear material and equipment. The proposed amendments would revoke the current general licenses for bulk tritium and alpha-emitting radionuclides having an alpha half-life of 10 days or greater but less than 200 years to conform NRC's regulations to the export control guidelines of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) for nuclear-related, dual-use items contained in IAEA INFCIRC/254/Revision 1/Part 2 and approved in 1992. 1 The alpha-emitting radionuclides subject to this rule are plutonium-236, plutonium-238, thorium-227, thorium-228, uranium-230, uranium-232, actinium-225, actinium-227, californium-248, californium-250, californium-252, curium-240, curium-241, curium-242, curium-243, curium-244, einsteinium-252, einsteinium-253, einsteinium-254, einsteinium-255, fermium-257, gadolinium-148, mendelevium-258, polonium-208, polonium-209, polonium-210, and radium-223 (specified alpha-emitting radionuclides). Consistent with the NSG guidelines, new general licenses would be established to permit the export of the specified alpha-emitting radionuclides and dispersed tritium to countries which are members of the NSG dual-use guidelines and to permit the export of the specified alpha-emitting radionuclides to most other countries when in a device, or a source for use in a device, containing less than 100 millicuries (3.7 GBq) of alpha activity per device (10 CFR part 71, appendix A, provides specific activities in curies per gram). 1 Tritium and reactor produced alpha-emitting radionuclides are the two commodities on the NSG dual-use list whose exports are regulated by the NRC. The other items identified on this list, including alpha-emitting radionuclides produced with nuclear particle accelerators, are subject to Department of Commerce export controls, and are contained on a list referred to as the Nuclear Referral List. The current general license for source material in ยง110.22(b) would be revised to reduce the annual limit of Canadian-origin natural uranium that can be exported to any single country from 1,000 kilograms to 500 kilograms to help assure U.S. compliance with provisions of the U.S.-Canada Agreement for Cooperation. The current general licenses for transuranic isotopes americium-242m, californium-249, californium-251, curium-245, and curium-247 would be revoked to conform NRC's regulations to the International Atomic Energy List of the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM). Although COCOM was dissolved in March 1994, the NRC is placing specific licensing controls on these isotopes because the U.S. and other COCOM member countries agreed to retain export controls on the existing COCOM list of items. Steps are now being taken by former COCOM member countries to propose that the NSG control most, if not all, of the nuclear commodities on the COCOM list. The proposed amendment to restructure Appendix A, which describes the nuclear reactor equipment subject to NRC licensing authority, will be addressed in a separate rulemaking proceeding. II.
