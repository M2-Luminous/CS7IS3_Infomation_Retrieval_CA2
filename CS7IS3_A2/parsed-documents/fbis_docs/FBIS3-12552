It is a poor response to the new emerging compulsions of the post-cold war era as well as to new opportunities and the search for a possible reversal of the decades long arms race in South Asia. Above all it hardly helps those in Pakistan genuinely desirous of achieving a better equilibrium between its requirements of legitimate defence and development needs. If India, which is already spending more than dollars six billion on defence continues to feel insecure internally and externally, notwithstanding its huge size and relatively much more developed industrial base, how can Pakistan lower its guards with a more sensitive strategic location, lack of depth and limited industrial potential. India's proposed military spending of dollars 7.6 billion for the new fiscal year is up by dollars 1.27 billion and covers much than what is justifiable by its inflation rate of 8.5 percent. The substantial new increase is reportedly the highest since 1986-87 when it recorded the highest jump of over 31 percent. On the whole the military spending maintains the tempo introduced into it since 1982-83. Apart from the three services, the border security force has also a higher allocation. In its other features the Indian budget now indicates a new flexibility to break the rigid postures of the past few decades and respond more energetically to the new economic changes of the day. Indian finance minister has eased access to foreign exchange in a bid to move towards a full float of the Indian rupee. Domestic industry is being exposed to greater foreign competition by reducing custom duties on imports. Taxable incomes now have higher exemption limit while corporate tax rate has been substantially lowered. Credit will also be cheap with the banks lending rated slashed. But the lowering of external tariff has been balanced by some concessions to domestic industry to pull it out of the recession of the past two years. Such measures undoubtedly will further reinforce the process of the profound economic change set in motion in India since 1991 to open its economy to foreign investors. Whether India can execute the process of the market-oriented economic reforms and achieve a balanced socioeconomic growth without containing her military spending is an open question. But Pakistani planners and economic policy makers need to closely monitor India's new moves to put it on the global investment radar screen, as emphasised by an Indian official recently. For a long time we have been used to superficial comparison of ours and the Indian economy. In a changing international and regional environment it is necessary to shed a complacent view and develop a more informed and critical understanding of the economic changes in India.
