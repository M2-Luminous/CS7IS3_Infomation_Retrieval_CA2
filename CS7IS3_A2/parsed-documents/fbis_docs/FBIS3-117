Mr Cassim confirmed on Monday [28 February] that he had tabled surprise proposals to a parliamentary committee last week, but added they had not yet been officially adopted by the IFP, but "this can become the IFP's line". The African National Congress [ANC] in Natal immediately rejected the postponement of elections -- "April 27 is non-negotiable," said provincial spokesman Dumisani Makhaye. "If you tamper with that date you'll be unleashing forces that will destroy everything in this country," he said. Mr Cassim said the proposals would be discussed at an IFP Central Committee meeting in Ulundi on Monday night. In terms of the suggestions, the April elections should be postponed in Natal/kwaZulu while they go ahead in the rest of the country. An interim administration, of which kwaZulu would be one component, should be put in place in Natal. The other components could be nominated by the state president or whoever is in authority, said Mr Cassim. "The people of Natal should then be allowed to develop a provincial constitution and then put this to a referendum." The IFP would, however, draw up this constitution which would have to be accepted by a 60 percent majority, he explained. "Then within 90 days, an election would take place and we would then join the rest of the country on the basis of a constitution that has the support of the people of this, the second most populous region in the country." The IFP believed it would win a "clear majority" in a referendum of this sort, he added. Mr Cassim said the proposals were important as time was running out. "If you can't stop time, the best thing is to take part of the process out of time constraints. The ANC says it will bend over backwards and the fact is that we must find a negotiated settlement. It would be wrong for us to stop the rest of the country if they're ready. Equally, it would be wrong to force an equally important province to hurry along to something it has been opposed to all along. Rather than adding towards conflict, it might be necessary to have an alternative approach... and prevent a total deadlock and impasse." Mr Makhaye, meanwhile, charged that the IFP was trying to buy time after having isolated itself from the country's negotiation process. "The patience of our people is not endless. But what has held them back from venting their anger is precisely because people are focusing on the April 27 democratic elections. I personally think the time has now come to move forward to democracy with or without the IFP or those wanting a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland]. We can't bend over until we break our spines."
