A Somali journalist said at least one person was killed in the fighting which lasted almost three hours. The fighting occurred between the K4 roundabout on Afgooye Road and the seaport. Militiamen exchanged machinegun and rocket fire. It was unclear which clans were involved in the fighting, but Somali journalists said it pitted "bandits from rival clans". South Mogadishu is the fiefdom of warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid of the Somali National Alliance (SNA). United Nations deputy military spokesman Major Asif Iqbal said no United Nations peacekeeping forces were involved in the fighting. "We don't know which clans were involved in this", Major Iqbal said. [passage omitted] Factional fighting has been escalating during the week, but previous clashes involved the use of small arms. Three SNA officials were reportedly killed near the October 21 Road on Sunday by a lone gunman who fired into a crowd, a Somali journalist said. SNA militiamen vowed to retaliate and surrounded a building near the stadium.
