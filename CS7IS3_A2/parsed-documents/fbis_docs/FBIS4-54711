In a relatively brief period of time after the Middle East peace process was launched in Madrid in late 1991, two of the most important participants in the negotiations have shown that political will, mutual compromises and concessions can result in considerable progress in the further solution of the complicated problems which have accumulated in the region over the past decades. Hailing the signing of this important document, the Republic of Bulgaria expresses its belief that it reveals real possibilities for continuing peace negotiations after the Madrid formula and creates the necessary preconditions for the signing of agreements between Israel and the other Arab countries taking part in the peace process, preserving and guaranteeing the balance of interests of all Middle East states, the declaration of the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry reads.
