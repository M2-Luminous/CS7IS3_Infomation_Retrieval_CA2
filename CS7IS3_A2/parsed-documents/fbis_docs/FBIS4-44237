Nicosia barrister Akhileas Dhimitriadhis, appearing on behalf of Kyrenia refugee Titina Loizidhou, and Attorney General Mikhalakis Triandafilidhis told the 19-member Grand Chamber of the European Court it should waive Turkey's objections and examine the facts of the case. They said Turkey, by virtue of its 20-year occupation, exercises control over the north. Earlier a member of the European Commission of Human Rights, which has also examined the case, told the Court it must uphold the Commission's report and examine the substance of the complaint. Loizidhou, who launched her campaign in 1989, has accused Turkey of stripping her of her fundamental human rights by preventing her return to her property in the occupied north. The case was first heard by the Commission under Article 25 on individual recourse. The Commission declined to rule on whether her right to property was violated and the case was referred to the European Court by the Cyprus government. Turkey, citing procedural points--including the date when it had ratified Article 25 and the reservations it had attached, told the European Court yesterday it should not hear the case. It also argued that it should not be party to the proceedings because there is a different "legal entity" in the occupied north.
