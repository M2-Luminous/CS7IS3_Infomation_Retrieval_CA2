Thus last weekend witnessed a meeting of the Russian Party's activists, who demanded to recall their party leader, Sergey Shuvaynikov's candidature, accusing him of attempting to conceal the sources of his campaign financing and embezzlement. A few hours later three unidentified persons broke into the apartment of Russian Society chairman (Anatoliy Los), whose voice was among the loudest to accuse Shuvaynikov, took him to the street and beat him up. According to some other members of the Russian Party Political Council, they were threatened with physical violence, too.
