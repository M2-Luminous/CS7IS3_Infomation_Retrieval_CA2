According to Zhirinovskiy, the LDPR is forced to do this "by the present course of the Russian leadership" which "does not justify the hopes" of Liberal Democrats for resolving problems facing the country. Speaking about policy towards former Soviet republics and other foreign countries, Zhirinovskiy called for closing down some sections of the state border and for expelling from Russia those who have no entry visas. He demanded that Russian troops be pulled out of all "flash points". "No contacts with NATO and no joint war games," thundered the LDPR leader. Turning to domestic problems, he favoured an immediate suspension of "privatisation a la Chubays". Zhirinovskiy said that the LDPR parliamentary group did not vote on Friday for the 1994 federal budget which, in the group's opinion, is "an anti-social budget". Zhirinovskiy disfavoured proposals on extending powers of the president and parliament. "We cannot adopt this version," the LDPR leader said at the lower house, giving, however, no explanations why his group favours this position.
