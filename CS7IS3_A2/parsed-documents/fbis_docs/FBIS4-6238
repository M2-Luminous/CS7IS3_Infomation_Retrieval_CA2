Some time ago, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry let loose outbursts that our nuclear development should be stopped even at the risk of another war on the Korean peninsula, that the United States will not rule out a preemptive strike against us, and that it will make military preparations against war. At the same time, the U.S. military circles are taking actions, such as bringing in massive military equipment, including Patriot missiles, to South Korea; concentrating its Naval force in the waters around our country; and frequently staging military exercises with the South Korean puppets. The outward escalation [nogoljogin hwaktae] of the U.S. military circles' military actions are extremely dangerous provocative acts designed to carry into practice the war scenario which they had rounded off through the Team Spirit exercises with the purpose of crushing [apsal] our socialism with force [him]. As it has been widely known, the Team Spirit joint military exercise is a test nuclear war and a preliminary war opposing us. The goal of such exercise is aimed at not only threatening us militarily but also rounding off their preparations to unleash a new Korean war. Now, the U.S. military circles attempt to carry their provocative war plan into practice. The step-by-step escalation of the U.S. military circles' military actions opposing our republic is an expression of the strategy of the expansion of arms market which had been worked out through back-door dealings [maghuhungjong] between the U.S. Administration and the U.S. war industry monopolies. The U.S. war industry monopolies try to aggravate the situation by all means in order to make enormous profits by manufacturing more weapons. However, with the end of the Cold War, it became more difficult for them to sell lethal weapons. The U.S. administration officials are, without exception, servants of big monopolies, especially munitions industry monopolies. Hence, they try to unleash a war on the Korean peninsula to fatten the munitions industry monopolies. In the meantime, the South Korean puppet clique, which tries to sustain its filthy life through outside dependence, maneuvers to massively bring in U.S. weapons to give enormous profits to the U.S. war industry monopolies and drive its fellow countrymen into a whirlpool of war. Stemming from these political goal and economic interests, the U.S. military circles have set themselves onto the stage of raising the curtain of the already-plotted Korean war scenario and buckling down to promote it on a full scale. Taking advantage of the reckless military actions taken by the United States, the South Korean puppets made public their war plan to invade the North, the New Operation Plan No. 5027, and issued a special alert on the puppet Army. In this connection, the puppet Armed Forces are fully prepared to kindle a war at any time. Currently, a very grave situation is being created on the Korean peninsula in which the flames of war may flare up even over a trivial and accidental element. This kind of situation was born wholly because the United States and the South Korean puppets have already entered a stage of actual military action to provoke a new war. It is brazen-faced for the U.S. military to depict such reckless antirepublic military action as if it were for its self-defense while talking about a diplomatic resolution through patience. It is a well known fact that historically, before attacking another country, the United States has used the method of advocating a diplomatic resolution and then justifying a military action. In the past, when committing armed invasion toward countries such as Grenada and Panama, the U.S. ruling class hung the seemingly signboard of protecting the U.S. citizens, the antidrug struggle, and so on. The active and tolerant diplomatic resolution which they are professing toward us constitutes war diplomacy to yield and gain supremacy over us through armed invasion. Also, their so-called defense is nothing but a smokescreen to hide their bellicose nature and aggressiveness. What is absurd is that some members of the U.S. ruling class are spreading falsehoods by saying things as if we were taking some kind of military action first, and are attempting to justify their military adventurous maneuver. This is a defilement of our peace- loving position and a nasty act which is to damage the self- defensive character our revolutionary armed force possesses. The international social circle officially recognizes our peace- loving position and policy. Our revolutionary armed force is through and through a self-defensive armed force in which its fundamental mission is to defend our republic's sovereign right and security. It is preposterous for some members of the U.S. ruling class to publicize about our so-called military attack, and is the same as the proverb, "Like a thief calling another a thief." During the Persian Gulf war, the United States put on a bold front of the single superpower, openly moved and deployed the aggressive forces in this region, and committed an overall war on Iraq. However, in our country, the United States laid a smokescreen of so-called self-defense, is concentratedly deploying armed forces in South Korea and its region, and is also trying to carry out a military attack opposing our republic. However, they have miscalculated. No forcible measures can work for us at all. Our people and the People's Army are sharply observing the unusual war attempt by the United States. If the United States and its cat's paw kindle the fire of war to the end, we will answer through a resolute counterattack by defending our country's socialist system and the Republic's dignity. The truth of history is that justice is victorious and injustice is defeated. The United States must not carry out rash and thoughtless acts, and it will be good for it to not forget the bitter lesson of the past Korean war.
