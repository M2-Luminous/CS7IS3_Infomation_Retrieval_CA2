FBIS4-29435 "dreas117_d_94037" FBIS-EAS-94-117 Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 South Korea Contract Signed for High-Speed Rail System Contract Signed for High-Speed Rail System SK1406075194 Seoul YONHAP in English 0729 GMT 14 Jun 94 SK1406075194 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, June 14 (YONHAP) -- The Korea High-Speed Rail Construction Authority (KHRC) contracted with Anglo-French Consortium GEC-Alsthom on Tuesday for the 2,101.6-million-dollar high-speed train system. KHRC President Pak Yu-kwang and GEC-Alsthom President Pierre Bilger signed the contract at the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) in downtown Seoul. The contract will take effect when the KHRC makes an advance payment to GEC-Alsthom after the authority takes out a loan with Indosuez Bank of France for 2,337 million dollars, a KHRC official said. With Tuesday's contract, the system for the high-speed railway linking Seoul and Pusan has finally been decided -- the TGV (Train a Grand Vitesse) -- almost three years after the KHRC invited bids from France, Germany and Japan on Aug. 26, 1991. Train manufacturers from France and South Korea will jointly design the TGV trainsets late this year with production slated for June next year, according to the KHRC. The high-speed train system will be established by September 2001, with the TGV trains running on the 410-kilometer track between Seoul and Pusan in 124 minutes at a maximum speed of 300 kilometers per hour with over 1,000 passengers aboard. As for technology transfers from GEC-Alsthom to South Korean businesses, KHRC officials said that at least 50 percent of the 46 trainsets must be localized and that if the localization rate does not reach 50 percent, Alsthom should pay a fine comprising 20 percent of the shortfall, according to the KHRC. Meanwhile, 12 Korean and French firms will participate in a consortium to manufacture and supply the trainsets, and the consortium will be divided into five groups, KHRC officials said.
