FR941227-2-00108 FR941227-2-00076 (10) What types of remotely-sensed data do you use, or plan to use, in concert with Landsat or Landsat-type data? (check all that apply) • Laboratory measurements/observations. • Ground-based measurements. • Aerial photography. • Non-photographic data from airborne platforms. • Space photography. • Very high spatial resolution (1&hyph;5 meters), non-photographic data from space-based platforms. • High spatial resolution (5&hyph;80 meters), non-photographic data from space-based platforms. • Moderate to low spatial resolution (>80 meters), non-photographic data from space-based platforms. (11) How do you currently rate the ease of obtaining Landsat data? • Readily obtainable. • Somewhat difficult to obtain. • Very difficult to obtain. (12) What is the primary difficulty you encounter with the use of Landsat data? • Cost. • Data characteristics (spatial/spectral resolution). • Data availability. • Other (please specify) XXXXXXXXX (13) In the past 6 months, have you used any commercial or public on-line service to search for, or browse Landsat data? • Yes. • No. (a) If ``Yes,'' which one(s) XXXXXXXXX (b) Did the service meets you needs? • Yes. • No. If ``No,'' please explain XXXXXXXXX (14) How many full Landsat scene equivalents did you obtain in calendar year 1994 (to date)? • <1. • 1&hyph;5. • 6&hyph;10. • 11&hyph;20. • 21&hyph;100. • >100. (15) For Landsat data you purchased since 1/1/93, please indicate the number of scenes acquired for each period. ␣ 1␣ 1MSS 1TM 1/1/93 to present 1/1/87&hyph;12/31/92 1/1/82&hyph;12/31/86 Before 12/31/81 (16) The cost of Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data from Landsat 7 is expected to be substantially less than the current cost of TM data. Assuming a per scene cost for ETM+ of $500&hyph;1000, will you plan to use • More Landsat data/year than now. • Less Landsat data/year than now. • About the same number of scenes per year as now. • Don't know. (17) Over the last five years, the number of Landsat scenes you have used has • Increased steadily. • Decreased steadily. • Remained about the same. • Varied from year to year. • Not applicable_not a data user in that period. (18) If the same data were available through a domestic station at double the price but with a substantially shorter delivery time than through a foreign station, which of the following would be true? • More likely to buy data from domestic station. • More likely to buy data from foreign station. • Makes no difference. • Data source may vary dependent on other requirements. • No opinion.
