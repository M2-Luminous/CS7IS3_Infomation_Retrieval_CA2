Referring to the fact that the uncontrolled inflation in Iran was a serious concern for both government and the people, `KAYHAN INTERNATIONAL' said in its editorial that the officials are aware that nothing could weaken or erode the achievements of the Islamic revolution like a runaway inflation. The damaging aspects of inflation could never be underestimated, the paper said, adding that, although material progress was not promised, social justice was, and at the heart of social justice lies an equitable distribution of resources and income. Referring to the measures taken by the government to control inflation the paper said that more time was required before they could produce results. It added that two points should be taken into consideration if remedy was desired: First, the country's economic problems "are partially political," secondly, irrespective of the changes in government policies, the desired economic performance would not be realized unless Iran's plans on privatization and joint venture investments have not been materialized.
