Every country in the world either has faced, or will face, an energy crisis in one form or another, and because of that, all possibilities must be determined and attempts made to avoid--as far as possible--being damaged by that crisis. With respect to consumer countries, if the aspect of that crisis is the supply or supplies of energy from abroad, then we, as a producing and exporting country, have another aspect of that crisis. The latter aspect is represented by the diminished price of this energy, its excess production and supply, and the drop in consumption, which will result in reducing the life of its reserves. Consequently, this natural wealth will dry up in a shorter period of time. This is especially true since our country is going through extremely critical circumstances, with regard to rebuilding the national Iraqi economy during this iniquitous blockade imposed upon our valiant nation. The process of air conditioning the buildings located on more than 200 commercial streets has changed the use of the land of those streets from residential, in accordance with the basic design agreed upon for the city of Baghdad, to commercial in accordance with decisions made by the Municipal Council during the last decade. This requires producing additional electrical energy, considered to be among those economic sectors that are capital intensive. This sector requires high investments as a result of the enormous sums of money needed to establish power stations, transmission networks and lines, and electrical transformers. This gives the allocated investments an active and influential role in raising or lowering growth rates with regard to the production of electricity. In Iraq, the capital-intensiveness of the electricity sector was reflected in consecutive increases in total fixed capital formation during the period 1970 to 1990. Through observing actual electricity production in Iraq from 1970 to 1990, it becomes clear that total fixed capital formation rose from 32.8 million Iraqi dinars [ID] in 1980, in fixed prices for the year 1970, to ID155.5 million for 1990. This shows an annual growth rate of 8.1 percent for 1970-90. The consumption of electricity fluctuated among the various sectors. The domestic household sector consumed 40 percent, while the administrative and services sector consumed 41.5 percent for 1988. These percentages rose in 1989 to 43.5 percent for the household sector and 36.6 percent for the administration and services sector, while the percentage of consumption for the industrial sector, which is the sector that forms the country's backbone, was no more than 8.5 percent in 1988 and 7.9 percent in 1989. We should note that those percentages are different in advanced countries. For example, in Sweden the percentage of electricity consumed in the industrial sector in 1985 was 40 percent of total consumption, and in the transportation sector it was 20 percent, while the commercial and residential sector consumed 40 percent. In the United States, the residential and commercial sector used about 17 percent of total electricity consumed in 1985, while industrial sector consumption was no more than 23 to 25 percent. The services sector used 35 percent of total consumption. Advanced nations try generally to guide their consumption and concentrate on the industrial sector, considering it the influential economic sector with regard to the state's economic structure. One should note that the industrial sector's consumption rates in these countries are generally close to or exceed the residential sector's consumption rates. Reducing the volume of consumption for air conditioning, which uses 55 percent of the electricity consumed per residential unit in Baghdad, is very necessary, especially if we consider that this consumption goes up to 80 percent from May to October. However, it is very unfortunate that changing the environment of these streets from residential uses to commercial (multistory buildings, with commercial shops on the ground floor and residential apartments, offices, and clinics on the other floors) has resulted in major economic losses in the consumption of electrical energy. This decision was made without regard to, or in violation of, one of the design principles that must be employed in architecture and urban planning when erecting any building in the city. That principle is to protect human beings from climatic conditions and provide a suitable environment for living, working, and recreation. In order to achieve that, it is necessary to provide that building with a group of architectural and physical characteristics that make it an appropriate social instrument to fulfill its various functions.
