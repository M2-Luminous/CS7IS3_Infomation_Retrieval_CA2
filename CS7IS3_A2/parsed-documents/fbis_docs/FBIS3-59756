Overview Japanese society and its economy continue to undergo remarkable changes: diversification and sophistication in the people's lifestyle and consciousness, changes in regional and industrial structures, a society made up of increasingly more elderly people, and globalization. In addition, there are calls for worldwide cooperation in tackling global environmental problems as an issue common to all of humanity. Towards the goal of coping with these socio-economic changes and improving the standard of living, technological development in the field of transportation plays an increasingly important role. During FY93 the Ministry of Transport (MOT) will develop railway technology, automotive technology, shipbuilding technology, ocean-utilization technology, space-development technology, and so forth, and will promote the development of technology that covers many fields: improving traffic and transportation safety, improving port and harbor construction technology, mitigating natural disasters, improving disaster-prevention technology, preventing pollution, preserving the environment, etc. Table 1 summarizes the MOT-related Special Coordination Funds for Promoting S&T in the FY93 budget. The subtotal of major expenses for research institutes that are under the MOT's control increased 3.3%. As for administrative department expenses, transport technology R&D expenses increased 3.6%, and geostationary meteorological satellite operation expenses increased 19.9%, resulting in a 19.1% increase in the subtotal. The overall expenses under MOT jurisdiction increased 9.8%, indicating growth that corresponds to the importance of R&D in the field of transportation. In addition to those expenses, ¥5.767 billion as subsidies for the development of railway technology, such as superconductive magnetic levitation train technology, and ¥996 million as subsidies for advanced ship technology R&D are appropriated in the general account.

B. Research at Major Research Institutes Table 2 shows the items implemented as special research in FY93, centering on MOT research institutes. This table also includes research items based on budgets appropriated in lump sums for other ministries and agencies and special accounts. Below we will explain those items that warrant special mention, centering on new research items. 1. Research on Structural Safety Evaluation To Accommodate Lighter-Weight Ships From now on, the demand for larger and faster ships is expected to increase, and various types of high-speed ships are being developed in Japan and other countries. With that, the current safety standards for light-structure ships are being revised by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and safety standards for the new high-speed ships are being studied in Japan as well. This research involves investigating structural safety, which is closely related to the safety of high-speed ships. Because the existing design standards are not applicable to some parts of the new types of ships, necessitating safety evaluation by means of direct calculations, the MOT will investigate weight-setting methods, structural analysis methods, and strength evaluation methods for that; clarify the necessary and sufficient conditions for ensuring safety; and study methods of safety inspections based on actual ship measurements. 2. Research on Aircraft Monitoring Methods for Shorter Vertical Control Intervals With the increase in the volume of air traffic, it is expected that altitudes of 29,000 ft and higher 1,000-ft vertical intervals will have to be adopted in order to effectively use air space. With that there has arisen a need for setting up a system that monitors, detects, and excludes aircraft whose altitude maintenance error exceeds a certain value. This effort involves researching the feasibility, configuration, etc., of a monitoring system for the purpose of establishing technology for monitoring aircraft altitude maintenance error. 3. Research on Advanced Earthquake-Resistant Design Methods for Seaside Facilities To Withstand Strong Earthquakes Directly Beneath Tokyo Recently, the increasing probability of a powerful earthquake occurring directly beneath Tokyo has been indicated, and the investigation of how Tokyo's seaside facilities will hold up in such a scenario has become an urgent issue. Accordingly, the MOT will conduct research to infer earthquake engineering characteristics, the dynamic behavior of structures and foundations that would result from such an earthquake, the amount of structural deformation in such a disaster, etc., in order to improve the level of earthquake-resistant design methods for seaside facilities. 4. Research on Technology for Evaluating the Safety of Advanced Urban Railway Transit Systems The introduction of "advanced transit systems" that use new technology in urban rail lines is thought to be very effective in solving problems such as congestion during commuting hours and the longer amounts of time people spend on trains. However, there have been hardly any technical evaluations of these advanced transit systems, and there has been little progress in making those systems practical. Therefore, safety evaluation technology must be improved so that it can handle the new technology and thereby facilitate the introduction of these transit systems. This research involves investigating technology for evaluating transit safety, brake performance, and train operation security systems, and gathering data on the safety of advanced transit systems. 5. Research on Advanced Technology for Predicting Global Warming Owing to the increase in atmospheric CO<inf> 2</inf> caused by fossil fuel consumption, global-scale warming has become an international issue; warming prediction, socio-economic affects, and measures for coping with global warming are being investigated in the IPCC. Because there will be an abundance of observational data in the late 1990s from programs such as TOGA and WOCE, this research involves developing technology for comprehensively analyzing that data, maintaining grid-point climate data, and developing atmospheric-ocean-coupled models of the entire globe. 6. Research on Methods of Platform Testing ABS-Equipped Large Vehicles Although regulations mandating ABS (anti-lock brake system) installation in combination vehicles and large buses are enforced, tests of ABS performance during usage have not been implemented, and only the electronic control sections of ABS systems are inspected. With the increase in ABS-equipped vehicles from now on, mandating periodic inspections necessitates the development of platform testing devices with which performance tests equivalent to road tests can be reproduced for the purpose of confirming the state of ABS operation during braking and the resulting safety. This research involves investigating the performance requirements for platform testing devices, formulating the specifications of and trial-producing a device, and obtaining materials on testing methods. 7. Research on the Application of NO <inf> x</inf> -Reduction Technology to Medium-Weight Gasoline Tank Trucks (Expenses for National Laboratories' Test Research on Pollution Prevention, etc.) Countermeasures against diesel exhaust are urgently needed because environmental levels of NO<inf> 2</inf> are not achieved near major urban roadways and floating particulates cause health problems. Such measures, however, are technologically difficult. If the kind of technology used in passenger cars for dealing with exhaust gas can be applied to medium-weight gasoline tank trucks, that would be an effective way to prevent air pollution in the future. This research effort involves studying ideal NO<inf> x</inf> -reduction technology that can be applied in medium-weight gasoline tank trucks (catalytic converter rhodium, etc.), measures for improving the durability of catalysts, and other such technology for practical use. 8. Research on Advanced Methods of Identifying Trace Amounts of Lubricating Oil (Expenses for National Laboratories' Test Research on Pollution Prevention, etc.) After fuel oil, the most prevalent leakage from bilges into the ocean is generally a mixture of fuel oil and lubricating oil. As time passes, the low-boiling-point components evaporate and mostly lubricating oil remains, but, with analysis methods up until now, identifying lubricating oil had been difficult. In recent years, however, the functions of analysis equipment have improved, and the analysis of high-boiling-point components in lubricating oil has become possible. This research involves investigating methods of analyzing those components, then combining those with existing methods to establish a way to identify bilges and lubricating oil with a high degree of accuracy. 9. Research on Technology for Utilizing Human Perception and Sensory Functions in Nuclear Power Plant Operation (Expenses for Nuclear Power Test Research at National Laboratories) In the operation of nuclear power plants and other such large-scale systems, conveying plant information to the operators through physical models is effective, but the manner in which the information is conveyed to operators must be compatible with human perception and sensory functions. For that reason, providing information that is selected with consideration for human capabilities and characteristics is important. In this effort researchers will investigate ways to convey information so that whatever is currently happening in a plant can be recognized with the five human senses, the purpose of which is to accurately convey automated, black-box plant information; operational methods based on the information that is conveyed; and ways for operators to be able to sense the effects of operations on the plant. 10. Basic Research on Foundation Measures for Nuclear Power Facilities in Coastal Regions (Expenses for Nuclear Power Test Research at National Laboratories) Because harbors are important as transportation nodes, basic research must be accumulated in connection with radioactive substance transport measures, nuclear power facilities in coastal regions, and evaluation of the safety of those.

This table does not include research based on Expenses for the Promotion of S&T and Expenses for Promotion of Global Environmental Research. C. Transport Technology R&D Expenses These are R&D survey expenses that have been appropriated since FY82 for facilitating cooperation between the government and private sector in the R&D of transport technology that relates to many fields. Table 3 shows the research that MOT will conduct in FY93. One such effort, "research studies on the development of transport-related multipurpose satellite systems," involves the development of repeaters for search-and-rescue communications (SAR) demonstration experiments. "Research studies on establishing comprehensive safety measures to cope with the changes in traffic environments in recent years" involves the development of technology pertaining to harbor facilities that will accommodate the safe navigation of super-high-speed ships during the night and in congested areas, the objective of which is to shift the demand away from road transportation, where worsening traffic environments are becoming a social problem, to marine transport. The objective of "development of on-rail trailers for low-pollution goods distribution" is to develop an on-rail trailer system that is suitable for faster combination vehicles, improved conveyance technology, smaller yard work space, and labor saving in order to facilitate converting the transport mode from trucks to railway in mid- and long-distance freight transport. "Research on public transport technology for the elderly and disabled" involves R&D of bus systems suitable for use by elderly and physically handicapped people, terminal guidance systems for visually impaired people, etc., because reducing the physical burden involved and improving safety are essential for the use of public transport by elderly and handicapped people.
