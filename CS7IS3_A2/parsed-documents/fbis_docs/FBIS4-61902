The Union advocates military action against Abkhazia. Speaking on national television, Kakubava said that many men could be mobilized by the Union in no time at all. What he needed, he said, was understanding with the authorities and the Union's Council would soon discuss the issue with Eduard Shevardnadze. Kakubava was confident that a united Georgia would find it very easy to defeat the Abkhaz separatists and mercenary forces. He said several hundred Georgians were fighting in guerrilla units on Abkhazian territory.
