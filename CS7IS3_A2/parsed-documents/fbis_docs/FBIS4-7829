Serbian fighters who managed to break up the strong Muslim offensive from Gorazde, despite cold weather today continued expelling Muslim soldiers from the remaining bunkers and strongholds in the direction of Viskovici and Gorazde. A veritable chaos is reigning in the units of the so-called Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina in this region and some mutual showdowns have taken place among them, that is, between those people who want to cross the Drina from its right bank to the left bank and the police forces who are making this impossible. Fighters from the units of the army of the Srpska republic are very carefully clearing the minefields that the Muslims have set everywhere. Major Andjelko Milicevic from the Command of the Joint Serbian Forces said this morning that Serbian fighters, starting from the directions of (Faljika) and Trebinjaca yesterday neutralized all enemy's firing positions without having suffered any losses themselves and took control over some typically Serbian places that were occupied by Islamic fanatics. The Serbian village of (Kirin), only half a kilometer away from Viskovici, was thereby liberated. The Command of the Joint Serbian Forces points out that the Muslim Army has suffered great losses, thereby denying Muslim [Sarajevo] radio reports that there were casualties among civilians.
