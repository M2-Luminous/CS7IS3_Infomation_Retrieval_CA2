He said: "Japanese and U.S. companies are talking to each other actively and in depth; I would like to think we may soon get some results from these talks." He was asked if he thought a settlement would be possible by 17 March, the date on which the United States says it will announce a list of sanctions measures against Japan. He said: "I don't know," but ended on a note of cautious optimism by saying the 17 March deadline could well prove to be "a turning point" in the negotiations.
