Prime Minister Mart Laar at a press conference after the Cabinet meeting said the permit had been issued for "a small group of military." Laar said "no problems or obstacles" had emerged over the issue of the nuclear reactors' pulldown with Russia. Estonia and Russia have also held talks over the possibility to bring into the country additional equipment necessary for the dismantling of the reactors. The Estonian leader added that also the Nordic countries had promised to extend help in the process if necessary. The government's special representative in Paldiski, Juri Tikk, told BNS on Friday [18 March] that both Estonia and Russia were ready to start taking out nuclear fuel from the reactors. The two countries' officials in joint staff and command maneuvers on March 16 trained coordination of activity for the case of emergencies. Tikk said the countries are ready to act effectively also if the worst happened and an explosion involving radioactive materials took place. "The Russian side has asked that in case if the `black scenario' really starts to happen, which the Russian military in Estonia would be unable to manage with, 200 Russian military experts together with the necessary equipment be brought into Estonia via the Amari airfield. The Estonian side has not objected to this plan in principle, but demands that an exact list of the military and their equipment be presented before the dismantling work begins," Tikk said. Tikk declined to confirm or dismiss the reports that work on taking radioactive fuel out from the reactors was going to start on Apr. 6. He said the date was still open.
