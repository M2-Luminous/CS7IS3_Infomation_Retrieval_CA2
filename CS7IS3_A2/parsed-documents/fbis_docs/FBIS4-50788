Li Ruihuan first briefed them on the achievements China has scored in implementing the policy of reform and opening up to the outside world. He said: The sustained and rapid growth of the Chinese economy has opened up broad prospects for economic cooperation and trade with foreign countries. It is estimated that the total volume of China's imports in the remaining seven years of this century will top $1 trillion U.S., thus providing an excellent opportunity for all countries, business circles of Denmark included, to carry out economic cooperation and trade with China. He said that Danish businesses are welcome to take part in China's economic development and he wished them greater successes in the Chinese market. Officials of close to 10 noted Danish businesses gave briefings on their experience in economic cooperation and trade with China. They spoke highly of the tremendous economic progress China has made in recent years and noted that they would work to expand cooperation and promote economic relations and trade between the two nations. In the afternoon, Li Ruihuan toured the noted Kasper [name as received] Brewery on invitation. Accompanied by the group's general manager Michael Yir, Li Ruihuan viewed the brewery's beer production and bottling facilities and heard a briefing on the brewery. [passage omitted].
