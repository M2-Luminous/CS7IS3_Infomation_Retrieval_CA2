In the past, journalists who ventured into the area have complained of harassment by militias who were widely believed to have been trained by the government during the rule of President Habyarimana. Rwanda's ambassador to Uganda, Claver Kanyarushoki, is in close contact with the interim government. In Kampala, Mwambu Wanendeya asked him how they see the French intervention. [Begin recording] [Kanyarushoki] The French Government has had a long cooperation history with Rwanda in many fields including the security [word indistinct], so it is true that France had cooperation with Rwanda, and among the fields of cooperation were the military and gendarmerie and so on. [Wanendeya] But these allegations that they trained these militias who people perceive as being responsible for most of the massacres. Is there any truth in that? [Kanyarushoki] I do not believe so. Definitely, they train the Army, parts of the Army like the Belgians were doing, like the Germans were doing with the gendarmerie, so they trained the regular Army, there is no doubt about it, but for the militias, I do not think they did unless there is any hard evidence, but I will doubt very much that they did ever train the militias outside the regular Army. [Wanendeya] Do you think the media coverage of this war has been biased in favor of the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front]? [Kanyarushoki] Yes, definitely. [Wanendeya] And why do you think this? [Kanyarushoki] I do not know. Perhaps, there might be so many reasons including the ground work done by the RPF itself, by their public relations, and by their own propaganda. I do not know, really. There might be some other reasons, but I think those are the ones, which is the fact that they do have a good network of public relations and good contacts in the media and so on. [end recording] Meanwhile, refugees sheltering in a church in the Rwandan capital have once again come under artillery fire. The 8,000 people in Sainte Famille have been waiting for weeks in the hope of being rescued by UN Forces. UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] has been trying to ferry people across the battle lines during the sporadic lulls in the fighting between interim government forces and the RPF rebels. On the line to Kigali, Raggi Omar asked Serge Arnauld of the French News Agency if the church had been badly damaged in the attack. [Begin Arnauld recording] Yeah, it did not hit the church itself. It was close to the church, but as there are so many refugees -- UNAMIR estimates that there are around 8,000 -- five of them have been killed this morning. [Omar] Have you managed to get down to the Sainte Famille Church yourself? [Arnauld] Yeah, a few journalists could go there with the UN, but we came after the shelling so we only saw the impact of the mortar shell. We did not see the bodies of the wounded. [Omar] What was the situation at the Sainte Famille Church once you were able to get there? [Arnauld] The situation is horrible. I mean there are thousands of refugees in the church, which is dark and (?stinks). It is really terrible. They are all asking to take them out. Now, the UN is... [pauses] It is already 10 days that they have not done... [pauses] They cannot do anything for these refugees, so the situation of these refugees is worsening and worsening. [Omar] Is there any idea as to who might have been responsible for the mortar bomb or is that impossible to tell? [Arnauld] There is an idea. It should be the rebel forces because they are shelling in this direction. The church is located in an area of the government troops who normally could be... [pauses] It should be the rebel forces who fired the shell. [Omar] Has this been the only incident of its kind today? [Arnauld] It was the only incident of its kind today. The fighting was not as strong as yesterday--only sporadic shelling, so it was the only incident we know. [end recording]
