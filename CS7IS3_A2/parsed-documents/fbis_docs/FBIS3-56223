This meeting will likely be recorded as a turning point in history and its results are interesting to everybody. We are subconsciously waiting for a miracle to happen; we are expecting our lives to get better. Therefore, a great many journalists gathered at a news conference held at the Supreme Soviet press center. My colleague Ivan Hladkiy was also invited. So, I am turning the microphone over to him. [Hladkiy] Interest in this news conference was enormous. It was manifested in the great number of journalists who took part in it. Their interest is quite understandable. Currently, everyone is speaking about the unification of two monetary systems -- Russian and Belarusian; about the upcoming visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton to Minsk, and about other urgent issues. The entire audience was eager to know what issues our Belarusian delegation settled in Moscow. This is how Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich characterized the results of the Moscow talks. [Shushkevich] "I am going to read the joint communique. It includes the following ideas: First of all, we have discussed the issues of the economic situation and other issues of bilateral relations. The most important thing is that we have arrived at a unanimous decision and I am pleased to mark that the treaty on cooperation, signed in December 1990, when the two states were parts of the former USSR, does not suit new realities. It is high time to immediately draft a new full-fledged treaty on friendship and cooperation. We have also discussed the visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton to Moscow and Minsk and reached an understanding on this issue, as well as on the issue of the unification of the Belarusian and Russian monetary systems; the merging of our monetary systems. It is very difficult to declare and then unite our monetary systems. Therefore, work on the adjustment of the positions of the two countries is being continued. In my mind, this work will be done in January, that is, [words indistinct]. Boris Yeltsin has authorized Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin to visit Minsk in January, where he will hold additional talks with the Belarusian Government. If by that time work on the rapprochement of mutual positions is concluded [words indistinct] and a legal footing for this unification [word indistinct]. I personally consider the issue of equal prices to be the key issue. I am satisfied with the fact that we could explain to the Russian leadership [words indistinct] about Chernobyl. [Words indistinct] some 15 percent of our state expenditures are represented by Chernobyl costs. Therefore, it is very difficult for us to stand on our own feet when Russia is pursuing its own pricing policy. I hope that we will [words indistinct] with Russian President Boris Yeltsin resolve this issue this month." [Hladkiy] The CIS Executive Secretary Vladimir Zalomay, Belarusian vice prime minister, said: [Zalomay] "Actually, the key issue on the agenda is the unification of the two monetary systems. Currently, the mass media are carrying various reports as to which stage this process has reached. I would like to note that this process is in the penultimate stage of being concluded. However, the work has not yet reached its final stage. The final step will be made in January in Minsk. We have completed all the preparatory work, which puts the unification of the monetary systems on a legal footing." [Hladkiy] There were many questions and they were very different. However, the prevailing majority of questions concerned the monetary union: What will be the exchange rate of Belarusian hares [nickname for Belarusian currency]? Will Belarus lose its state independence? What advantages will this monetary union provide Belarus? Belarusian National Bank Chairman Stanislav Bogdankevich addressed all of these questions. [Bogdankevich] "Answering the question on the exchange rate of Belarusian rubles, I can say the following: At the moment, we have no written agreement on the exchange rate. We understand that we can begin using an exchange rate of 10:1, in favor of the Russian ruble." [Hladkiy] "So, what was the reaction of international financial organizations to the possible unification of the Belarusian and Russian monetary systems?" [Bogdankevich] "The IMF has somehow expressed its concern with the fact that we do not properly inform it on the course of negotiations on the issue. I met with an IMF representative and explained to him the current state of affairs. Later, we received another IMF statement recommending that we think hard and adopt decisions carefully." [Hladkiy] "What can you say about the circulation of Russian rubles and Belarusian hares when our states unite their monetary systems?" [Bogdankevich] "The concern is that if the decision on the establishment of a 1:1 exchange rate of Belarusian hares and Russian rubles is adopted, then it will not be necessary to immediately withdraw our Belarusian payment notes from circulation. We should put into circulation that amount of Russian money that our population requires for [words indistinct]. I am emphasizing that we are approaching the signing of an agreement on this exchange rate, but it has not yet been signed. As for the unification itself, I think that if we unite our financial systems on a sound basis, on the basis of using and distributing Russian primary raw materials, primarily energy resources, on Belarusian territory, it will be easier to stabilize the Belarusian economy and to preserve markets in Russia and Belarus. In this aspect, the key issue is to agree and unite on the basis of using domestic Russian prices at the moment we begin using the Russian currency. Not later, but instantly." [Hladkiy] These are their opinions and prospects. However, my dear listeners, we can do nothing but wait. Let us hope for the best.
