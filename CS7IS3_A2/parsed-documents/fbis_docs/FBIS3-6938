Jali Ahimsa, director general of the National Atomic Energy Agency [BATAN], said this to reporters after opening a meeting of a working group of Asia-Pacific atomic experts in Kuta, Bali. According to the BATAN director general, a lack of funds is the main obstacle in the construction of the Gunung Muria Nuclear Power Plant. However, he attached great importance to the use of nuclear power because Indonesia will need huge electricity supplies, particularly in Java and Bali, in the future.
