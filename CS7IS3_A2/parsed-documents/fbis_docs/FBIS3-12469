FBIS3-12469 "drnes041dd_94005" FBIS-NES-94-041 Document Type:Daily Report 2 Mar 1994 Palestinian Affairs Sha'th: U.S. Organizations Funding `Extremists' NC0103215594 Cairo MENA in Arabic 2040 GMT 1 Mar 94 NC0103215594 Cairo MENA Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Text] Cairo, 1 Mar (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser and head of the Palestinian delegation to the peace talks, returned to Cairo this evening after a three-day visit to Tunis, during which he participated in the meetings of the Palestinian leadership and the PLO Executive Committee. Dr. Sha'th stated upon arrival that he is carrying a letter from Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat to President Husni Mubarak dealing with the current situation and contacts during the next stage. These fall within the framework of Palestinian contacts and action during the period when the negotiations are suspended. Sha'th clarified that Palestinian activity will consist of his going to London; Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, head of the PLO Information Department, to Paris; and Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political Department, to Damascus. He added that another Palestinian envoy will travel to Washington to hold talks with U.S. officials. The Palestinian official said that after the horrible massacre, which is rife with collusion and menace, we need to take a stand to guarantee security for the Palestinian people under occupation. There cannot be peace without security and the situation cannot continue as it is with the presence of the armed settlers under the protection of the Israeli army shooting everywhere and killing innocent people. Sha'th noted in his statement that the Palestinian stand will provide an opportunity for taking swift action through the Security Council and through negotiations with the Americans. He praised the important roles Nabil al-'Arabi, Egypt's permanent representative to the United Nations, and Ahmad Mahir, Egypt's ambassador in Washington, are playing to bolster the Palestinian stand. He pointed out that 'Arafat is holding constant meetings with a number of Arab and foreign officials. He will meet this evening with a Russian envoy, and then a Greek envoy because Greece is the current chairman of the European Community. Sha'th noted that 'Arafat has contacted President Mubarak more than once. He also contacted Indonesian President Suharto, Senegalese President Abdou Diouf, Saudi Arabian King Fahd, and Moroccan Monarch King Hassan II, and discussed with them the situation and action to guarantee the security of the Palestinian people so that the peace process can continue on a sound and correct basis. Sha'th said that suspending the negotiations represents a hiatus because, at this time, we cannot continue these talks. We need to prepare a sounder basis for continuing them. On the guarantees the Palestinians are demanding, Sha'th said that two of the most important guarantees are to provide international protection on the one hand, and disarm the criminal settlers on the other, because disarming the settlers achieves some security for the Palestinians. The presence of international protection adds life to this security. After these two conditions are met, there are many things that need to be reviewed, such as the settlement process. We need to put pressure on the international conscience so that it will see that settlement is one of the obstacles before peace. Sha'th said that there is another important issue that the Palestinian envoy to Washington will discuss during his meetings with officials there. This is that the criminal who committed the Hebron massacre, and most extremists and criminals in Israel, are of U.S. origin. There is a clear relationship between them and some legitimate U.S. organizations that gather aid and contributions from the United States to fund and support these extremists in Israel. Sha'th pointed out that when Likud Party leader Netanyahu was in the United States, he was with these criminals from the Kach gang, as was Kahane, who collected contributions from them. Therefore, the United States has to bear its responsibility in this regard where financing terrorism publicly is a major responsibility. As regards the steps Israel has taken, such as releasing some Palestinian detainees and disarming some settlers, Sha'th said: This was nothing new. Shahaq told me before the massacre was committed that some detainees would be released during the current week. However, they tried to exploit this point once again. I reiterate that the new aspect in the Israeli reaction has been their admission that religious and racist extremism and terrorism are characteristics that apply to the Israeli settlers as well, after they had been using them to describe the Palestinians. Despite this confession, the deterrents and punishments are devoid of any content and represent only something shamefully negligible.
