Conventional single-crystal substrates must satisfy several difficult to satisfy requirements: structurally compatibility with the film, a coefficient of thermal expansion compatible with that of the film, and chemical inertia toward the film material, in addition to matching degree of modularity and of its plane surfaces. A comprehensive study has yielded an alternative solution to the problem: a substrate with a bicrystalline structure with proven strontium titanate as the preferred material. This choice had been confirmed experimentally on the basis of quality control by optical and x-ray inspection methods. A thin high-T[.sub]c[/] ceramic film was grown on a heated substrate by the vapor deposition process from two rotating identical solid ceramic disk targets, which had been produced from the same mixture of Y,Ba,Cu oxides. The targets were placed at a right angle to one another and symmetrically at a 45� angle to the substrate (``on base of a right equilateral triangle''). They were vaporized by identical YAG:Nd+++ lasers operating in synchronism, the two also mutually orthogonal laser beams being focused each by a lens for normal incidence on the respective target. The vapors emanating from the targets were channeled to merge into one stream normally incident on the substrate oriented. Specimens of such a structure were examined under a polarization microscope. Measurements revealed a 2�-periodic anisotropy of the reflection coefficient for polarized light as a specimen was rotated about the axis perpendicular to the substrate surface, the amplitude of this anisotropy being largest for light of 1 eV quantum energy and in this case obeying the Malus law. The structures were also tested for Raman scattering of light by the films. Interferometers built on such substrates were tested for response to intensity oscillations of an external magnetic field. Microbridges and quantum interferometers were formed by standard methods of optical photolithography. The critical current density in the direction across the seam of the bicrystal-substrate was found not to exceed a few kA/cm[.sup]2[/] and the critical direct current for thus produced Josephson junctions to be within the 30 �A � I[.sub]c[/] � 300 �A range. Their current-voltage characteristic fitted the RSJ hyperbolic model, with blurring in the vicinity of the critical current caused by the fluctuation component of the junction current. A magnetometer containing such a d.c. interferometer connected into the appropriate electronic circuit had an energy resolution of 3.1x10[.sup]-30[/] J/Hz and a field sensitivity of 6.6x10[.sup]-13[/] T/Hz[.sup]1/2[/] at the 500 Hz frequency.
