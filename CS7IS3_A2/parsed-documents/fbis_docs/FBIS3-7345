The author of the article says: The U.S.-Japan military tieup is an immediate offspring of their policies toward Korea and Asia. The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are persistently seeking military tieup, motivated by the ambition to stifle the DPRK with strength and invade and dominate Asia with the Korean peninsula as a springboard. They are showing new dangerous military moves around the Korean peninsula while continuing military confabs for the upkeep of U.S. troops in Japan, Japan's assistance to them, intensified cooperation in military technology and arms buildup under the cloak of "Japan-U.S. security." At a meeting on "Japan-U.S. security affairs" a few days ago, the U.S. and Japanese ruling quarters confirmed that the "Japan-U.S. security pact" was "vital." They claim that the "pact" has not lost its meaning but, on the contrary, has assumed a new meaning because "destabilising factors still remain" in Asia, specially the Far East. Their description of the DPRK as "a destabilising being" is a reversed logic and a trick to invent a pretext for strengthening their military tieup and anti-DPRK camhaign. Intensified cooperation in military technology and active promotion of the unification of military activities are part of their moves to tighten military tieup. It is noteworthy that the United States and Japan are these days making haste with the "theatre missile defence initiative" allegedly to cope with "nuclear threat" and "missile threat" from the DPRK. The "theatre missile defence initiative" is aimed at a missile attack on the DPRK. In this way, the United States is pursuing a military adventure against the DPRK and socialism and the Japanese reactionaries are going to arm themselves with missiles. The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are proceeding with studies to strengthen the joint operation posture for a "case of emergency" on the Korean peninsula. Large-scale U.S.-Japan combined field exercises of three services have been held several times in recent years on a "scenario of the case of emergency on the Korean peninsula." Their dream of stifling the DPRK and invading and dominating Asia through their military tieup is anachronistic. We are fully prepared to respond to any military pressure and offensive from them. They must immediately give up the attempt to stifle the DPRK through military tieup.
