It said that dialogue was the preferred way of bringing the situation under control. The presidential statement also reaffirmed the need for the security forces to continue their duties of maintaining public security, safeguarding public property, and eradicating violence and terrorism. AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned from reliable sources that President Zeroual will initiate a dialogue with the leaders of the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] leaders now in prison, Abbasi Madani and Ali Belhadj to be specific. These leaders were moved from Blida prison the day before yesterday to an unknown place. There have been numerous rumors over the past few weeks about the transfer of the FIS leaders to a villa somewhere, but the report seems to be genuine this time. The sources, who have recently been in contact with President Zeroual, quoted him as stressing that he assumed the post of president in order to hold a genuine dialogue and that he intended to do so. President Zeroual's statement came after the spectacular Lambese jailbreak and after the lengthy meetings of the military commands. President Zeroual appears to have been able to settle the controversy and disagreement in his favor after the recent attacks by the hard-line anti-dialogue tendency as reflected in the speech delivered by Prime Minister Redha Malek at the funeral of playwright Alloula in Oran and in the campaigns of the French-language papers criticizing the regime and its failure in an attempt to obstruct President Zeroual, forced him into a corner, and put him on the defensive. Behind that campaign were the forces which maintain that the fundamentalists should be stamped out and the hardline security option, not the dialogue option, upheld. Political observers believe that the death sentences handed down to six fundamentalists yesterday were part of the attempts to embarrass President Zeroual and part of the arm-twisting tactics the hard-liners are trying to use. In view of that situation, President Zeroual is expect to reshuffle the cabinet.
