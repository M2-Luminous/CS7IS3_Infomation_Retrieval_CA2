In this article I am going to narrate some historical facts I personally witnessed in the struggle led by Comrade Mao Zedong against the Lin Biao Counterrevolutionary Clique in commemoration of that great person. In July 1969 the party central leadership decided to transfer me to work in Beijing. At that time I was an alternate member of the Central Committee's Political Bureau. At first I was appointed to work in the Routine Work Group [ye wu zu 2814 0523 4809] of the State Council and in the Executive Group [ban shi zu 6586 0057 4809] of the Central Military Commission. I was concurrently first secretary of the Anhui Provincial CPC Committee. Sometime later I was also appointed to be director of the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army. In August 1970, on the eve of the Second Plenary Session of the Ninth CPC Central Committee, I went to Anhui's Huaibei area, where production remained in a backward condition, to conduct investigations and studies for nearly a month. There, I received the meeting notice and directly went to Lushan from Anhui. The Second Plenary Session of the Ninth CPC Central Committee opened on 23 August 1970. Chairman Mao presided over that day's meeting, and Premier Zhou announced the three subjects on the plenum's agenda, namely, the revision of the PRC Constitution, the formulation of the national economic plan, and the issue of war preparations. According to the announced agenda, Kang Sheng should deliver a report on the draft of the Constitution, but at this moment, Lin Biao spoke. Although the agenda announced by Premier Zhou did not list Lin Biao's speech, as Lin was then vice chairman of the party Central Committee, it was regarded as normal if he spoke ahead of Kang Sheng. In his speech, Lin Biao talked a lot about Chairman Mao's genius. He said: "Chairman Mao's status of being a great leader, head of state, and supreme commander" is a "feature" of the new Constitution. Such a leading position "must be recognized by all people except some extremely counterrevolutionaries at home and abroad." That evening after Lin Biao's speech, at the meeting of the Political Bureau to discuss the outline of the national economic plan, Wu Faxian suddenly proposed that people attending the plenum of the Central Committee the next day listen to the recording of Lin Biao's speech and discuss this speech. The plenum thus made such an arrangement. The next day problems arose in the discussions of various groups. People who had ganged up around Lin Biao spoke separately in the north China group, the central and south China group, the southwest China group, and the northwest China group to express the same opinions according to the arrangements made by Ye Qun beforehand. They all advocated the theory of genius and insisted on setting the post of state president and electing Chairman Mao to be state president. Before that, Chairman Mao had officially proposed that no state presidency be set, and this had also been discussed and approved by the Political Bureau. So comrades in the Political Bureau were all aware of this. It was impossible that Lin Biao was unaware of this. However, why did he mention this again at the plenum? In order to support this action, Chen Boda and Ye Qun had long made preparations. After going up to Lushan, they hastily collected some quotations. After Chen Boda's selection, they compiled a document entitled "Some Quotations of Engels, Lenin, and Chairman Mao on Genius" overnight and then distributed it to some people. The day after Lin Biao spoke, in addition to the several generals commanded by Ye Qun, Chen Boda also made a speech in the north China group. He even said: "A very small number of people even denounced the thesis that Comrade Mao Zedong has comprehensively defended and developed Marxism-Leninism in a talented and creative way as an "irony.'" "Some people tried to use Chairman Mao's greatness and modesty to belittle Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought." "Some counterrevolutionaries were very glad to hear that Chairman Mao would not be state president, and they even danced for joy!" In order to act as quickly as possible to support Lin Biao, he distributed his speech in the north China group's second briefing on the morning of 25 August. As Lin Biao was vice chairman of the party, many people thought that Lin's speech was endorsed by Chairman Mao, and as Chen Boda was a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau, his speech was also rather weighty. The distribution of the briefing changed the atmosphere of the plenum. People discussed it inside and outside the meetings and the agenda was completely disrupted. The intensification of the contradictions forced Chairman Mao to personally make a ruling. What was to be done at the next step at the plenum? People were deeply concerned. On the afternoon of 25 August, the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau held an enlarged meeting which was attended by all group leaders. Chairman Mao took a resolute action and announced three instructions at the meeting. First, the plenum should be adjourned immediately, and the discussion on Lin Biao's speech at the opening meeting should be stopped. Second, the north China group's second briefing should be retrieved. Third, no people should be purged, and unity should be kept according to the spirit of the ninth party congress, because Chen Boda's speech in the north China group violated the guideline laid down by the ninth party congress. Chairman Mao then sternly said: If you continue to act in this way, I will leave Lushan and you may continue to stir up trouble as you like. No one should continue to mention the issue of setting up a state presidency. Those who insist on setting up a state presidency may take the post themselves. Anyway, I will never be state president! He also told Lin Biao: I advise you not to take the state presidency as well, and those who insist on setting such a post should take it themselves! Several days after that, Premier Zhou relayed Chairman Mao's instruction to me: I should return to Beijing to take charge of the work of the Executive Group of the Central Military Commission so that Huang Yongsheng could go to Lushang and attend the meeting. Comrade Li Xiannian also returned to Beijing to replace Comrade Ji Dengkui so he could attend the meeting at Lushan. After returning to Beijing, I was not quite clear about the happenings at the plenum, and I was told later about what happened there. On 1 September Chairman Mao wrote "My Opinion" at Lushan, and the writing was sent to Beijing. I carefully read it many times. Chairman Mao's essay pointed out the nature of the event and openly criticized Chen Boda, but it still "protected" Lin Biao and left an opportunity for him to correct his mistakes. On 16 December, according to Chairman Mao's opinion, the Political Bureau decided to hold the North China conference to further expose Chen Boda's mistakes. The conference lasted from 22 December 1970 to 24 January 1971. At the conference, on behalf of the party central leadership, Premier Zhou systematically exposed Chen Boda's crimes and announced the party Central Committee's decision on reorganizing the leading body of the Beijing Military Region. I was appointed to be commander of the Beijing Military Region, and Ji Dengkui was appointed to be its political commissar. Before the announcement of my new appointment, Chairman Mao personally talked with me. On the basis of the north China conference, the central leadership prepared another report meeting to criticize Chen and party rectification. Premier Zhou led me and Huang Yongsheng, Wu Faxian, Li Zuopeng, and Qiu Huizuo to see Lin Biao in Beidaihe. Premier Zhou told me the purpose of our trip was to relay Chairman Mao's opinion on telling Lin Biao to attend the forthcoming report meeting criticizing Chen and party rectification. We were going to say something so that he might act in a face-saving way. When we met with Lin Biao in Beidaihe, he only told Huang, Wu, Li, Qiu to make self-criticism, but he himself still refused to admit his own mistake and did not express his willingness to attend the meeting. After returning from Beidaihe, Premier Zhou again took us to see Chairman Mao, and reported what happened in Beidaihe to the chairman. After listening to our report, Chairman Mao sternly criticized Huang, Wu, Li, and Qiu to their faces: "You have moved to the brink of the precipice! Are you going to jump or be pushed down the precipice? Or are you willing to be pulled back? All will depend on yourselves!" Chairman Mao was also unsatisfied with Lin Biao's attitude, but he did not say anything before Huang, Wu, Li, and Qiu. In the campaign of criticizing Chen Boda and rectifying the party's style, Chairman Mao read a large quantity of materials and found that the activities of Lin Biao and company were extremely suspicious. He decided to make an inspection tour to the south in order to further find out the facts and to make some preparations for the convention of the forthcoming Third Plenary Session of the Ninth CPC Central Committee. On 14 August 1971 Chairman Mao left Beijing and started his inspection tour to the south. He first arrived in Wuhan, and then went to Changsha, Nanchang, and Hangzhou. In his journey he met with local party, government, and military leaders, and mainly talked with them about the struggle beginning from the Lushan meeting in 1970. He pointed out: "At the Lushan meeting, they launched a sudden attack and carried out underground activities. Why did they not dare to act openly? Because they had a guilty conscience. Their sudden attack and underground activities were all conducted in an organized and planned way according to a certain guideline, and the guideline was to set the state presidency and to advocate `genius' for the purpose of opposing the line laid down by the ninth party congress and to overturn the three-point agenda for the Second Plenary Session of the Ninth CPC Central Committee. A certain person was anxious to become state president, and tried to split the party and to usurp the power." "Comrade Lin Biao did not consult me before he made his speech, and he did not let me read his script beforehand." He added: "This time, Vice Chairman Lin should still be protected, and no conclusion was made on blaming him. Of course, he should still bear certain responsibility. What should be done to other people involved? Our principle remains one for educating the erring people. That is, `learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, and cure the sickness to save the patient.'" After arriving in Nanchang on 31 August, Chairman Mao was told that Zhou Yuchi, a backbone member of Lin Biao's clique, transported an amphibious vehicle away from Jiangxi by plane. This aroused his vigilance. On 3 September, he left Nanchang for Hangzhou. When talking with local responsible comrades on the journey, Chairman Mao repeatedly stressed that his words must not be revealed to other people who were not present. However, on 5 September, when Li Zuopeng accompanied foreign visitors to Wuhan, Liu Feng revealed Chairman Mao's words to Li. The next day, as soon as he returned to Beijing, Li passed the message to Huang Yongsheng and Qiu Huizuo. Huang told Ye Qun on the telephone. Late on the evening of 5 September Lin Biao's underlings in Guangzhou secretly reported the contents of Chairman Mao's talk to Beijing's Yu Xinye, who took 15 pages of notes. On 6 September Yu personally flew a helicopter to Beidaihe and delivered the notes of the telephone report to Lin Biao, Ye Qun, and Lin Liguo. The information from the two difference sources shocked Lin Biao and company like a bolt from the blue. Being startled, they decided to lay murderous hands on Chairman Mao. On 8 September, Lin Biao personally wrote an order with a red pencil: "Act according to the order relayed by Comrade Liguo and Comrade Yuchi." At the same time, Ye Qun wrote a confidential letter to be personally opened by Huang Yongsheng: "The current situation is critical. We have decided to take action in Shanghai." When the criminals were tried later, they confessed that Lin Liguo and his accomplices worked out three methods of assassinating Chairman Mao: First, to use flamethrowers and bazookas to attack the train carrying Chairman Mao; second, to use 100-mm antiaircraft guns against the train; third, to order Wang Weiguo, political commissar of the Fourth Air Force Army in Shanghai, to carry a pistol in to see Chairman Mao on the train and take action during the meeting. After coming to Hangzhou, Chairman Mao had the train moved to Shaoxing. On 10 September, Chairman Mao suddenly decided to set off in the afternoon without asking any local people to see him off. More than three hours later, the train arrived in Shanghai. He did not leave the train; instead, he told his assistants to telephone Xu Shiyou and summon him to Shanghai. The next morning, the chairman talked with Xu Shiyou and Wang Hongwen on the train. After the talk, he asked Wang Hongwen to lead Xu Shiyou to the Jinjiang Hotel and have lunch there. As soon as Wang Dongxing returned from seeing them off, Chairman Mao told him: "We should depart now, and no need to notify them. The train should go now, and nobody should be notified. Let the vanguard train move first." From 8 to 11 September, Lin Liguo, Zhou Yuchi, and other accomplices gathered in a small bungalow of Beijing's Xijiao Airport, and continued to plan the assassination of Chairman Mao. Some of them proposed setting fire to Shanghai's Hongqiao Airport and taking advantage of the chaotic condition to kill the chairman. Some of them proposed the use of flamethrowers to burn the chairman to death, some people proposed using military planes to drop bombs, and another option was to lay explosives on the Suofang Bridge near Suzhou to blow up the train....However, before they had enough time to carry out the bridge explosion plan, Chairman Mao's special train had safely passed the bridge and sped northward without stopping. The train passed Bangbu, Jinan, and Tianjin. Then Chairman Mao ordered the train to stop, and told Zhang Yaoci to telephone Li Desheng, Ji Dengkui, Wu De, and Wu Zhong, and summon them to the Fengtai Railway Station. At 12 o'clock on 12 September 1971 we met with Chairman Mao in his special train in the Fengtai Railway Station. Comrade Wang Dongxing was also present. Although the chairman was somewhat tired after returning from the long journey to the south and was considering the struggle against Lin Biao and his company, he was still in a good mood and still talked in a humorous way. He said: "They launched a sudden attack on Lushan, and even tried to blast the mountain to pieces and stop the rotation of the earth....The issue of genius is a theoretical issue, and they held a viewpoint of idealism on this issue....A genius is just a bit cleverer, and a genius still must follow the mass line and rely on collective wisdom....What nonsense, talking about the peak and saying that each sentence I said could match 10,000 sentences other people said....I mentioned six times that there is no need to set up a state presidency. If one sentence could match 10,000 sentences, then there were 60,000 sentences. However, he still did not hear even half a sentence. There was no effect at all." Then Chairman Mao faced me and said: "You may ask them about the materials they distributed in Lushan, and may ask them three times a year: 'Why didn't you give me your treasured object?' And see what they would say!" Chairman Mao referred to the fact that they did not deliver the collection of quotations on "genius" they compiled in Lushan. At a meeting I mentioned this, and at that time Chairman Mao said: "You should ask them to give it to you!" After that, he always remembered this. Then, Chairman Mao added: "Chen Boda was not the only evil backstage manipulator [hei shou 7815 2087], there was still someone else." This remark hinted Lin Biao. Finally, Chairman Mao told me to carry out a task: Transferring one division of troops to Nankou. At that moment, Chairman Mao was not only alert, but also began to make concrete arrangements because he had expected the worst possibility that Lin Biao and his company might stage an armed coup d'etat. After saying goodbye to the chairman, I immediately arranged the transfer of one division. I did not expect a serious incident to occur that very night. On the evening of 12 September I attended a meeting at the Great Hall of the People. The meeting was chaired by Premier Zhou, and the subject of discussion was the government work report to be delivered to the forthcoming session of the Fourth National People's Congress. After 2200, the security guards in Beidaihe directly telephoned the premier, saying that Lin Biao, Ye Qun, and Lin Liguo would leave Shanhaiguan by plane, and the departure time would be 0600 the next morning (13 September) and the destination would be Guangzhou. Belonging to the same clique, Huang Yongsheng, Wu Faxian, Li Zuopeng, and Qiu Huizuo also planned to set off from Beijing at the same time the next morning. The premier paid close attention to the development of events, and felt that the developments went beyond his expectations. He frowned and told the guards to closely watch the happenings and report them to him at any time. Then, the premier immediately asked Wu Faxian why a Trident flew to Shanhaiguan, and ordered that the plane fly back immediately without taking any people back to Beijing. Wu Faxian spoke evasively and told a lie to the premier, saying that the plane was carrying out the task of night flying test and could not return because of a certain breakdown. Premier Zhou ordered: "The plane must not be allowed to move and must remain there, and must return as soon as the breakdown is fixed." At that moment, Lin Biao and Ye Qun were aware that Premier Zhou was inquiring about the movement of the Trident, and became more panic-stricken. In order to conceal their plot of fleeing to Guangzhou, at 2322 Ye Qun deliberately telephoned Premier Zhou: "Vice Chairman Lin wants to move." The premier asked: "Move by air or on the ground?" Ye Qun answered: "By air." The premier asked: "Do you have a plane?" Ye Qun said: "No." Ye Qun's answer gave herself away. At that moment, the premier knew that not only did the Trident-256 remain in Shanhaiguan, they had also dispatched an Il-14 to that place." Ye Qun's lie proved that they had plotted to flee to the south. Premier Zhou immediately called Li Zuopeng (because Shanhaiguan Airport was managed by the Navy): "Special plane No 256 at the Shanhaiguan Airport must not be allowed to move; only with an order jointly issued by you, Huang Yongsheng, Wu Faxian, and me can the plane take off." However, Li Zuopeng tampered with the premier's order, and changed it into "only with the orders of one of the four leaders can the plane take off." At that moment, the premier frequently walked in and out, and I knew that something must be happening." At 0032 on 13 September the security guards in Beidaihe reported that Lin Biao disregarded the obstruction of the guards and forcefully made the plane take off! The Shanhaiguan Airport reported this to Li Zuopeng three times and asked him what to do if the plane attempted to take off. However, Li Zuopeng did not issue an order to obstruct the plane. When Premier Zhou was told about this, he immediately telephoned Chairman Mao to report this to him and ask for instructions. After returning to our room, the premier told me that Lin Biao had fled by plane! He ordered me to rush to the Air Force Headquarters of the Central Military Commission to assume personal command on his behalf, and ordered me to report the situation to him without delay. The premier also instructed me that I must not leave the command post 24 hours a day. In fact, I did not leave Air Force Headquarters for five consecutive days and nights. At the same time, the premier sent Comrade Yang Dezhou to follow Wu Faxian to the Xijiao Airport (in fact, keeping watch on Wu's action) to control the situation. He also sent Comrade Ji Dengkui to control the Air Force Headquarters of the Beijing Military Region. The premier also issued a "no-fly order": "All airports throughout the country must be closed; no plane is allowed to take off. All radars must be set in motion to monitor the skies." I rushed to Air Force Headquarters, jumped out of my car, and rushed into the combat command office. There, I summoned Liang Pu, chief of staff of the Air Force, and both of us stared at the huge radar screen that covered the whole wall. At that moment, on the screen, I clearly saw the moving bright spot which indicated the position of the plane. It was moving between Chengdeng and the Sino-Mongolian borderline. Premier Zhou asked the control officer: "Can they hear you if you call plane 256 through radio?" The control officer answered: "Yes, they can." The premier said: "I need to talk to Pan Jingyin (we already knew that Pan was the plane's pilot), please put me through." The control officer said: "He turned on the radio, but did not reply." The premier said: "Then, please call plane 256 and tell them that we want them to fly back, and they may land at either Dongjiao Airport or Xijiao Airport in Beijing. I, Zhou Enlai, will meet them at the airport." The control officer reported: "He did not answer." The plane took a tricky course. It first flew westward, and then turned to the north. Liang Pu and I nervously watched the huge screen. Liang Pu said: "The plane is not flying in a normal condition." I asked: "What do you mean?" Liang said: "First, it is not flying along any international course; second, it is flying northward, and will soon cross the border and enter Mongolia; third, it is flying at a low altitude." I sat at a huge desk. It was the commanding room of the Air Force, and there is a red telephone through which I could directly call the premier. I continuously reported to him the position, altitude, flying direction of the plane. When I asked him how to handle the event, he told me that he had asked Chairman Mao for instructions. The chairman said: As the skies want to drop rains and the mother wants to remarry herself, let him go as he likes. On the early morning of 13 September, the plane flew out of China. I reported this to the premier immediately. At 0315 that morning, a report came from Shahe Airport: "A helicopter just took off and flew northward toward Zhangjiakou." I again immediately reported this to the premier. After asking Chairman Mao for instructions, the premier instructed: "Effect a forced landing. If it refuses to land, shoot it down!" I ordered the Air Force of the Beijing Military Region to dispatch eight Jian- 6 fighters to intercept the helicopter and forced it to land in Huairou County. Zhou Yuchi killed Comrade Chen Xiuwen, who drove the helicopter back, and then committed suicide together with Yu Xinye. Li Weixin was captured alive. What would happen after Lin Biao's plane flew out of China? At that moment it was expected that Lin Biao might flee to the Soviet Union. Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou made arrangements against all consequences caused by the incident. Local leaders must also be informed of the Lin Biao incident as soon as possible in order to cope with any contingencies. The premier personally phoned the principal leaders of all military regions, provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities and informed them of the happenings in an implicit but clear way. After all the arrangements were made, Premier Zhou had worked more than 50 consecutive hours without rest. At 1400 on the afternoon of 14 September, shortly after the premier fell asleep, the Foreign Ministry delivered an urgent telegram from the Chinese embassy in Mongolia. We could hardly awaken the premier. He asked the secretary to read the telegram. When he heard that Lin Biao's Trident-256 had crashed somewhere near Ondorhaan in Mongolia, he immediately reported this to Chairman Mao. I started organizing the investigation that night. According to Li Weixin's confession, we searched his residence and found a large quantity of evidence of the Lin Biao Counterrevolutionary Clique's crimes. Among other things, there was the "Outline of Project 571," a plan for assassinating Chairman Mao. There was also plenty of evidence showing that they planned to set up another central power organ in south China. I immediately sent some people to deliver the evidence to Premier Zhou and Chairman Mao. In the Air Force, a five-member group headed by Comrade Cao Lihuai was set up to assist me. In the course of the investigation, Chairman Mao stressed the need to act according to established policies, and repeatedly told us that only a very small number of people were Lin Biao's diehard followers, and the concrete historical conditions for most erring comrades should be considered. At that time, as Lin Biao was the party's vice chairman, people were not aware of his conspiracy. So it is necessary to carry out the policy of learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, and curing the sickness to save the patient when handling the erring comrades. They should be forgiven as long as they correct their mistakes. Concretely speaking, should all the tens of assistants and secretaries working with Lin Biao be fired? I don't think this is a proper way. Explanation should be given to them so that they may receive reeducation and then be assigned to other posts. They should not be fired, because they were sent by the party to work with Lin Biao. Chairman Mao's instructions ensured the smooth development of the investigation. After the 13 September Incident, Chairman Mao seriously reexamined various events during the Cultural Revolution, and personally corrected some ultra-leftist practices. For example, he instructed us to rehabilitate as many cadres as possible and to do this as soon as possible. The old marshals and many old comrades who were sent to other provinces by Lin Biao under the pretext of "evacuation for the purpose of war preparations" were successively allowed to return to Beijing. After that, Chairman Mao also personally examined many petitions and letters of appeal for the rehabilitation of old cadres, and wrote his instructions on them. He entrusted such affairs to the General Political Department. Under the leadership of Premier Zhou and Marshal Ye, we did a great deal of arduous work, thwarted the obstruction of the "Gang of Four," and rehabilitated a large number of senior officers in the armed forces.
