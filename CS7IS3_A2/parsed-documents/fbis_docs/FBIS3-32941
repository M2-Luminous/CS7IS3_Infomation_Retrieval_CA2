This figure includes collections of income tax and taxes on liquor, cigarettes, matches, inheritances, and fees, as well as collections on tax stamps. It indicates an increase of 45.17 percent over tax revenues collected in 1992. Broken down in detail, tax collections were as follows: - Income Tax: 103,511.0 million bolivares, compared to 63,486.0 million bolivares collected in 1992, an increase of 63.04 percent. The 1994 budget has set out an income tax collection goal of 136,275.0 million bolivares. - Alcoholic beverages: In this category the difference between 1993 and 1992 was not so pronounced. In 1992 13,754.0 million bolivares in taxes were collected, a figure which was 7.93 percent higher in 1993, when 14,845.0 million bolivares were collected. The tax collection goal for 1994 is 18,250.0 million bolivares. - Tax stamps: in 1993 13,368.0 million bolivares were collected, or 24 percent more than in 1992 (when 10,771.0 million bolivares were collected). With the reform of the law on tax stamps it is hoped to collect at least 27 billion bolivares in 1994, due to the increase in tax rates. - Cigarettes: tax collections in 1993 amounted to 17,104 million bolivares, against almost 14,000 million bolivares in 1992, which was 22.26 percent more in comparative terms. - Taxes on matches: tax income was 40,147.0 million bolivares in 1993, or 11.26 percent more than in 1992. The report on tax collections states that the goal set by the Directorate General of Taxes was not completely attained, due to the effects of smuggling matches, which resulted in a decline in production. - Taxes collected on inheritances, donations, and other, related taxes brought in 966.0 million bolivares in 1993, a decline of 17.8 percent, compared to the 1,176.0 million bolivares collected under this category in 1992. According to the report, this is the only tax collection area which declined due to temporary circumstances. The projection for 1994 shows a decline to 650.0 million bolivares. - Finally, 159.0 million bolivares were collected in fees, or 49.6 percent more than the 106.0 million bolivares collected under this category in 1992. The 1994 budget anticipates collection of 128.0 million bolivares in this category of taxes. With the exception of income tax, the other, internal taxes showed a growth of only 16.69 percent in 1993, compared to 1992. The report on tax collection activity in 1993 also showed that the activities of the Directorate of Tax Control in Caracas brought in 55,965.0 million bolivares in income tax. A special plan was set up for tax collections at the regional level. Another 35,525.0 million bolivares were collected as a result of opening tax cases against 850 taxpayers. This figure broke down to 14,126.0 million bolivares from taxes, 14,396.0 million bolivares from fines, and the remaining 7.0 billion bolivares from interest collections. Investigations carried out by the Directorate of Tax Collection on financial, industrial, and commercial companies, as well as service companies, had the following results. Reserves set aside amounted to 10,470.0 bolivares, and taxes plus contingencies resulting from reserves set aside amounted to 8.0 billion bolivares. Investigations carried out in the petroleum sector brought the following results: reserves set aside of 21,207.0 million bolivares and taxes plus contingencies amounting to 29,239.0 million bolivares. In the mining sector reserves set aside amounted to 643 million bolivares, and taxes plus contingencies amounted to 455 million bolivares. In 1994, the report states, it is anticipated that a strategy will be followed which will extend until 1996 for increasing tax collection, tax pressure, and a range of tax contingencies, thus reducing tax evasion, delays in tax payments, and requests for resource set aside for litigation.
