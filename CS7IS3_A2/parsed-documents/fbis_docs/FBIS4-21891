Hayane: "The Former FIS (Islamic Salvation Front) in Germany: Close to 200 Militants"--first paragraph is EL WATAN introduction] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] All Islamist organizations in the world have a pied-a-terre in the Federal Republic of Germany. In fact, this country has long been a favored meeting ground for these organizations, to hold their conventions, seminars, and conferences. Due to their very "official" nature, these activities are widely tolerated by German authorities. [passage omitted] Turkish and Iranian extra-Islamist ties in Germany--which remains one of the main destinations of the ayatollahs' agents in Europe-- are also very strong within the Turkish community, by far the most imposing and one of the oldest in the country; numerous and very- well-organized fundamentalist networks were created already a long time ago. As a rule, they are the ones who provide financial and material support to their Algerian "brothers," members of the former FIS [Islamic Salvation Front], who reach Germany through France or Italy. Since the state of emergency was declared in Algeria in February 1992, close to 9,000 Algerians are said to have applied for "political asylum" with German authorities. Some are genuine militants of Abassi's party; most of the others are just young black-market traffickers or illegal aliens taking advantage of the Bonn government's generosity toward militants of the Islamist party to try and settle in the country. Many succeed with various degrees of luck, with the complicity of some very lenient officials. Actually, Germany is said to number now close to 200 Algerian Islamist fundamentalists who are genuine activists, and therefore dangerous. As these militants of the banned FIS settle and travel, they seem to favor the area extending from Alsace-Lorraine (France) to Belgium and Germany. They settle, among other places, in the towns of Neunled, Kaiserlautern, Stuttgart, and Mannheim. Rabah Kebir, who was just forbidden by German authorities to engage in any subversive political activities or statements against Algeria, lives in Soest, near Dortmund. There, he was allowed full latitude to engage in subversive activities until he was called to order.
