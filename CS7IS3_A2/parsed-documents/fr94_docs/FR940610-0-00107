FR940610-0-00107 FR940610-0-00023 * * * * * (d) Valuation of annuities, interests for life or term of years, and remainder or reversionary interests for estates of decedents for which the valuation date of the gross estate is after November 30, 1983, and before May 1, 1989 _(1) In general. (i) Except as otherwise provided in §20.2031&hyph;7(b), if the decedent died after November 30, 1983, and the valuation date for the gross estate is before May 1, 1989, the fair market value of annuities, life estates, terms of years, remainders, and reversions is their present value determined under this section. If the decedent died after November 30, 1983, and before August 9, 1984, or, in cases where the valuation date of the decedent's gross estate is before May 1, 1989, if, on December 1, 1983, the decedent was mentally incompetent so that the disposition of the decedent's property could not be changed, and the decedent died on or after December 1, 1983, without having regained competency to dispose of the decedent's property, or if the decedent died within 90 days of the date on which the decedent first regained competency, the fair market value of annuities, life estates, terms for years, remainders, and reversions included in the gross estate of such decedent is their present value determined under either this section or §20.2031&hyph; 7A(c), at the option of the taxpayer. The value of annuities issued by companies regularly engaged in their sale, and of insurance policies on the lives of persons other than the decedent, is determined under §20.2031&hyph;8. The fair market value of a remainder interest in a charitable remainder unitrust, as defined in §1.664&hyph;3 of this chapter, is its present value determined under §1.664&hyph;4 of this chapter. The fair market value of a life interest or term for years in a charitable remainder unitrust is the fair market value of the property as of the date of valuation less the fair market value of the remainder interest on such date determined under §1.664&hyph;4 of this chapter. The fair market value of the interests in a pooled income fund, as defined in §1.642(c)&hyph;5 of this chapter, is their value determined under §1.642(c)&hyph;6 of this chapter. * * * * * (iii) In all examples set forth in this section, the decedent is assumed to have died on or after August 9, 1984, with the valuation date of the decedent's gross estate before May 1, 1989, and to have been competent to change the disposition of the property on December 1, 1983. * * * * * (5) Actuarial computations by the Internal Revenue Service. *␣*␣* Table LN contains values of lx taken from the life table for the total population appearing as Table 1 of United States Life Tables: 1969&hyph;71, published by the Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service. Many special factors involving one and two lives may be found in or computed with the use of the tables contained in Internal Revenue Service Publication 723E, ``Actuarial Values II: Factors at 10 Percent Involving One and Two Lives,'' (12&hyph;83). This publication is no longer available for purchase from the Superintendent of Documents.

New §20.2031&hyph;7 is added to read as follows: §20.2031&hyph;7 Valuation of annuities, interests for life or term of years, and remainder or reversionary interests for estates of decedents for which the valuation date of the gross estate is after April 30, 1989. (a) In general. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section and §20.7520&hyph;3(b) (pertaining to certain limitations on the use of prescribed tables), the fair market value of annuities, life estates, terms of years, remainders, and reversionary interests for estates of decedents is the present value of such interests, determined under paragraph (d) of this section. The regulations in this and in related sections provide tables with standard actuarial factors and examples that illustrate how to use the tables to compute the present value of ordinary annuity, life, and remainder interests in property. These sections also refer to standard and special actuarial factors that may be necessary to compute the present value of similar interests in more unusual fact situations. (b) Commercial annuities and insurance contracts. The value of annuities issued by companies regularly engaged in their sale, and of insurance policies on the lives of persons other than the decedent, is determined under §20.2031&hyph;8. See §20.2042&hyph;1 with respect to insurance policies on the decedent's life. (c) Actuarial valuations before May 1, 1989. The present value of annuities, life estates, terms of years, remainders, and reversions for estates of decedents for which the valuation date of the gross estate is before May 1, 1989, is determined under the following sections: ␣ 1Valuation date 2After 2Before 1Applicable section 01&hyph;01&hyph;52 20.2031&hyph;7A(a) 12&hyph;31&hyph;51 01&hyph;01&hyph;71 20.2031&hyph;7A(b) 12&hyph;31&hyph;70 12&hyph;01&hyph;83 20.2031&hyph;7A(c) 11&hyph;30&hyph;83 05&hyph;01&hyph;89 20.2031&hyph;7A(d)
