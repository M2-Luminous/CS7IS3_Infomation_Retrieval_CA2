The sources told AL-HAYAH that Talal al-Hasan, minister of state for foreign affairs, had summoned the Iranian ambassador and informed him of the Jordanian request to reduce the number of Iranian diplomats at the embassy as a result of the attack on the Jordanian ambassador's house some two months ago. The sources pointed out that among the other reasons for the Jordanian request is that the number of Iranian diplomats in Amman "exceeds by far the number of Jordanian diplomats in Tehran." Well-informed sources have said that there are more than 30 Iranian diplomats in Amman, compared with three Jordanian diplomats in Tehran. It was not possible to learn the name of the Iranian ambassador in Amman. When AL-HAYAH contacted the embassy, the employee on duty told AL-HAYAH to contact the embassy again on Saturday because he did not have the authority to reveal the ambassador's name. The authoritative sources said that the Jordanian Government "was not satisfied with the way Iranian authorities handled the attack on the Jordanian ambassador's house." They pointed out that the ambassador's house in Tehran was burgled two months ago. The sources also emphasized that Jordan has been seeking to improve relations with Iran since diplomatic relations were restored in 1991, 10 years after their severance following the breakout of the Iraq-Iran war.
