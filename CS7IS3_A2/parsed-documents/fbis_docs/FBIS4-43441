This is deplored by some, but majority support for fixed election periods is lacking. The year 1994 will be a remarkable election year. It looks as if the four-year election period will be fully utilized except for a few months. Neither the voters nor the politicians could have foreseen this when the last Folketing election was held on 12 December 1990, for Danes are not used to such a long time elapsing between Folketing elections. However it gives the politicians ample opportunity to stress campaign positions and engage in political debate even though the date of the election is not yet known. In long interelection periods the last year is used almost exclusively for getting into position for the coming election. This can be clearly seen at the moment, and it is amplified by the fact that there is no major legislation up for discussion in the Folketing. On the other hand it must be noted that during the long election period two notable popular referendums on European Union (EU) policy have been held, so the voters have been to the polls. In the past 30 years the election period has been almost fully utilized only three times. The VKR [Liberal-Conservative-Radical Liberal] government came to power as a majority government after the Folketing election on 23 January 1968. Prime Minister Hilmar Baunsgaard called the next Folketing election on 21 September 1971. The government lost its majority and the Social Democrats took over. The next time the election period was almost used up was under Poul Schluter's leadership. He called a Folketing election on 10 December 1984 when his four-party coalition government was voted down on the budget bill, and the next Folketing election was not called until 8 September 1987. The four government parties lost seats, but the coalition was reestablished. When a Folketing election was held on 12 December 1990, the result was a KV [Conservative-Liberal] government under Poul Schluter. A little over two years later Schluter and the government resigned because of the Tamil affair, and Poul Nyrup Rasmussen stepped into office. Now he is the one who must call the next Folketing government. Whether it is held in September, October, or November, the election period will have been almost entirely used up. Short Election Periods Paragraph 32 of the Constitution states that Folketing members are elected for four years. But the paragraph also contains the provision concerning the prime minister's right to dissolve the Folketing: "The king can call a new election at any time with the effect that the existing Folketing mandates become invalid when the new election has been held." [passage omitted] Restricting Dissolution Right Lars Bille, associate professor of political science at Copenhagen University, says it would restrict the political system too much if fixed election periods that cannot be deviated from are introduced: "I do not think that would be healthy. Situations can arise when it may be necessary to dissolve the parliament and call an election. But restricting the prime minister's opportunities to call an early election might well have a stabilizing effect on the political system." [passage omitted] Keep Dissolution Right Conservative Party leader Hans Engell does not think fixed election periods are something to work for: "If fixed election periods are considered at all, it would require a major reform of our political system that includes a higher cutoff limit for parliamentary representation, among other things. They have fixed election periods in Norway and a higher cutoff limit, but that has not prevented Norway from getting into very difficult parliamentary situations in recent years when the political system has largely ground to a halt for long periods of time. They cannot call a Storting election, a minority government cannot get its policies approved, and at the same time the opposition cannot band together to overturn the government. In any case there is nothing to suggest that fixed election periods in Denmark, which has eight parties in the Folketing and where a minority government is almost always in power, would create greater parliamentary stability." Engell says that the optimal situation for politicians, after all, is to try to make it through an entire election period: "We have had some complete election periods too, you know, for example from 1984 to 1987 under Poul Schluter. We now have a complete period again, though we had a government change in the middle. This provides some stability, but it must be admitted that a government change without a Folketing election leaves a residue of political frustration among the voters, who would like a chance to express themselves before the government is formed. Our experiences from January 1993 until now have shown that it would have been a big advantage -- also for Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, I think -- if there had been a real mandate to form a government." Engell wants to keep the dissolution right: "It provides a way to resolve a difficult parliamentary situation. The best thing is an unbroken election period in which the four years are utilized in a politically effective way by the government in combination with the Folketing. The next best thing -- if this cannot be achieved -- is that the prime minister has the authority to call an election." The Conservative leader does not think the fact that no one knows when the election will come hinders the political debate in the last part of a long election period: "The political debate is going full blast. It is one thing that the government cannot pursue its policy, but that does not hinder the debate from developing." Radical Liberals Radical Liberal leader and Economic Affairs Minister Marianne Jelved says the Radical Folketing group will continue to work for the appointment of a constitutional commission and that the Radicals want fixed election periods, "in a moderated form." "We have discussed the German model where the prime minister has the right to dissolve the parliament, but with restrictions, and where it is also more difficult to overturn a minority government because they must assess whether there is a basis for forming an alternative government."
