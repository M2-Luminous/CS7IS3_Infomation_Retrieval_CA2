The PFL also considered the designation of Senator Marco Maciel, but he declined. The PFL informed Senator Fernando Henrique Cardoso of the designation during a lunch. Cardoso was satisfied with the designation. He said: [Begin Cardoso recording] It is a good choice because we need someone from the northeastern region, with political experience, with well-known positions, and who will be accepted by the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]. Guilherme Palmeira meets these requirements. In addition, he can help us a lot because he is a factor for unity within the PFL, and this is important for the electoral contest in the northeastern region. [end recording] The PSDB is scheduled to hold its convention on 14 May in Contagem, Minas Gerais. The convention will formalize Senator Cardoso's designation as presidential candidate.
