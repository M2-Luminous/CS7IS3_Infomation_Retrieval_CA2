Within two hours of the expiry of the ultimatum, U.S. President Bill Clinton declared: "The NATO decision and its results provide new potential for progress toward an end to the tragic conflict in Bosnia." German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel added here: "We should make use of this fortunate moment to ensure that this first test will be transformed into a global solution." The Bonn meeting will bring together foreign ministry representatives from Germany, France, Britain, Belgium, Greece, Russia and the United States. The U.S. delegation will be headed by Clinton's special envoy for Bosnia, Charles Redman, who has stepped up contacts with the warring sides in the past week. The meeting is being held at Russia's request and reflects Russia's return to the stage of international diplomacy alongside the major powers, diplomatic sources here said. They pointed out the emergence of a new rivalry between the Russians and the Americans, now directly involved in the Bosnian crisis. Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev called last Friday for a meeting along the lines of the one to be held in Bonn. The U.S. State Department greeted the proposal with extreme caution. Diplomats will be charged with smoothing out the differences of view that have appeared in the past few days. The West, particularly the Europeans, are set on promoting a negotiated solution, come what may, on the basis of the European plan which envisages Bosnia being partitioned into three mini-states, and do not intend to allow themselves to be deflected by Moscow. But Russia, which has said it is ready to send 400 more paratroops into Sarajevo in the framework of the UN operation, in addition to the 400 already sent, could make its influence felt on the content of the negotiations because of its influence over the Bosnian Serbs. With the shifting of the focus for negotiations to Germany, Bonn will be able to play a stronger mediating role. "The goal for we Germans has been above all to include Russia" in the negotiating process, Kinkel emphasised Monday. Chancellor Helmut Kohl made several telephone calls to Russian President Boris Yeltsin before the NATO ultimatum expired at 0000 GMT Monday with the objective of persuading Yeltsin to accept NATO's decision. He also spoke of organising an international conference on Bosnia, for which the Bonn meeting could do the groundwork. The Germans hosted a Croat-Bosnian summit in early January and have good relations with both non-Serb parties to the conflict. They have been working behind the scenes to facilitate a rapprochement, "essential for a political solution" of the conflict, according to Kinkel. On Saturday Croat and Moslem Bosnian negotiators met in Frankfurt and announced that their positions had drawn closer after a day of talks on putting relations on a "lasting basis." In the Netherlands, Dutch Foreign Minister Pieter Kooijmans supported the idea of applying a NATO ultimatum to Tuzla and Srebrenica, but said "I think it would be very desirable if a decision of this kind could also be taken with regard to Mostar." He said the situation in government-held eastern Mostar was "very serious and an ultimatum could also have a positive effect there." Koojimans, interviewed on Dutch radio from Hilversum, said he thought it was "too early today to speak of a decisive turning point towards peace." "We have seen too often what we thought we had achieved collapse and as long as shots are heard, we should maintain the ultimatum in force." "We should also be certain that all heavy weaponry has really been withdrawn," he added.
