FBIS4-31965 "dreeu117_y_94009" FBIS-EEU-94-117 Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 YUGOSLAVIA Serbia _O_Belgrade Weekly Views New Wealth of Serbs _O_Belgrade Weekly Views New Wealth of Serbs 94P20892A 94P20892A CSO [Editorial Report] An article by Vesna Kostic and Aleksandra Bilanovic in the 13 May edition of the Belgrade news weekly NIN examined the increase in the number of wealthy people in Serbia and the manner in which they achieved their wealth. Only a few of the newly rich became so through "entrepreneurial ability," according to the authors. The rest acquired their wealth through "connections and acquaintances, institutional concessions, market monopolies, and natural resource concessions." NIN pointed out that some of the new rich, "through lobbying and bribes, ensured privileged positions for themselves in the granting of loans (especially last year from primary issue, or currency issued without backing), the distribution of strategic products, and the issuance of permits to engage in the import-export trade and real estate transactions." The article cited Dr. Aleksandra Posarac of the Belgrade Institute of Economic Science, who said that "a variety of mechanisms for plundering the people" exist and that they offer "ideal conditions for amassing enormous capital without work." In essence, according to Dr. Posarac, it is a matter of redistributing existing public resources. She defined these as foreign trade firms and all other public companies; society bears the risk while the profit goes into private pockets. The Dafiment Bank also played a significant role in the enrichment of individuals, in Posarac's opinion. "The lists of Dafiment depositors that have been made public account for the disappearance of only tens of millions of German marks, but the question of what happened to the 200 million that are unaccounted for remains. Where are they?" In a box titled "Who They Are and How Much They Have," NIN published a list of the Serbian new rich, qualifying it as incomplete and based on unverified assessments by business partners, acquaintances, and "accessible publications." NIN observed that the list shows that the rich are for the most part people who participate or participated in the government, who were or are directors of public enterprises, and who worked or still work in public foreign trade firms. Several of the individuals on the list, the weekly noted, have connections with Genex, a Belgrade firm also known as Generalexport that, according to the 1990 Trade Directory of Yugoslavia, engaged in foreign and domestic trade, representation of foreign firms, tourism, hotel management, and air transport. The list consists of the following names: -- The Karic brothers: Their total assets are assessed at $100-150 million; they own firms (trade offices) in almost all of the states of former Soviet Union, from Moscow and Kiev to Tashkent and Uzbekistan; they have opened firms on the other side of the Atlantic; they have at their disposal huge business offices in Belgrade; they have a house in Pec, Serbia, seven apartments in New Belgrade, and a villa in the Dedinje section of Belgrade. They own a huge piece of property near London with three medieval castles, one of which has as many as 38 rooms, luxurious swimming pools, and a thoroughbred horse farm. -- Zoran Drakulic: His worth is assessed at $100 million; in Cyprus he has a company with the name East Point; in Belgrade his company is called Ju Point and in Budapest Ein Point. This former Genex official "has expanded his business so much that he has even opened an office in China." -- Miroslav Miskovic: There are rumors that he has capital of $35-40 million dollars; former director of Zupa of Krusevac and former member of the Serbian Government, he is the largest shareholder of the Delta company (foreign trade, a bank, and the Deltino restaurant). He has a luxurious villa in "Neimar." -- Zoran Kacar: He is worth $15-20 million; he was the first to start purchasing hard currency for deposits into "giro" accounts through Interplast Trejd; he owns several apartments in Belgrade and a house on the coast; he is owner of a chain of bakeries in the United States and a large number of firms in Austria, Sweden, Germany, and Cyprus. There is a rumor in Belgrade that because of a conflict with the authorities he left the country and now lives in the United States. -- Zoran Markovic: He owns the Bel Pagetta firm, and he claims that the investment in this project amounted to $2 million, but "it is unlikely that he has at his disposal less than $5 million"; he has been expanding his business into Poland and Slovenia and is expected to expand into Romania and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; he lives in a Genex company apartment. -- Nikola Kitanovic: The man who invented "Raul Amon" says that the assessment of his worth at over $10 million is very modest; he expects a profit of $130 million from a contract recently signed with a Chinese firm. -- Dr. Nenad Djordjevic: This former State Security Service official and instructor at the Advanced School of the Ministry of Internal Affairs is today owner of the VTS firm; his worth has been assessed at between $50-130 million. -- Mirko Marjanovic (Serbian prime minister): It has been assessed that he has $50 million in cash. -- Dragan Tomic (minister in the Serbian Government, coordinator of the new economic program, and director of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's largest furniture company, Simpo): NIN did not succeed in discovering his worth, but it is claimed that his assets are for the most part in London in a firm that belongs to his son, who is in the re-export business. -- Zoran Obradovic: A former Genex employee, he is the owner of the Petromet firm; his worth has been assessed at about $10 million. -- Miki Savicevic: Former director of Genex, he has firms in Switzerland and Russia; it is believed that his worth is about $10 million. -- Milenko Isakov: He is the owner of the MCS firm, which exports copper; his worth has been assessed to tens of million of dollars. -- Sinisa Radosevic: also a former Genex employee, he is in the agricultural business and is worth up to $10 million. The list does not include Radoman Bozovic, Federal Assembly speaker, and Dusan Matkovic, general director of the ferrous metallurgy firm Sartid-13 and former minister of industry, although their names are "most often publicly mentioned," NIN states, adding that this is because no one is willing to give any information whatsoever on the way the two obtained their wealth and on the amount of their wealth. "Many names are mentioned in a whisper and with fear, which not only reveals that what is at issue may be the wealth obtained through illegal means, but also that these are people who have a tendency to resort to violence and malevolent displays of their power." Very often what is at issue are personalities from the "demimonde" and even the "real underworld." Thus, for example, a certain Manda is mentioned as the owner of a rather large number of gambling houses and boutiques, but merely mentioning his first name is considered to place the safety of one's family at risk, NIN says, adding that the same is true of attempts to decipher the origin of the wealth of Zeljko Raznjatovic Arkan and his close associates. In its 27 May issue, NIN reports that Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic, whose name appears on the list above, has filed a complaint at the First Municipal Court in Belgrade against the NIN journalists who wrote the article for "damage to his reputation and honor."
