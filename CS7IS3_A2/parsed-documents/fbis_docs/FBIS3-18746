The government promised to keep government expenditures in real terms on the same level as in 1991. It did not succeed in keeping its promise. In 1991 government expenditures increased about 15 percent and in 1992 by a further 16 percent. Last year government outlays including bank support were 202 billion markkas or 15 percent greater than the 175 billion markkas included in the budget proposal. Aho's government has begun to interpret its own objectives in such a way that it would be sufficient if there were a return to the 1991 level in 1995. When the government announced its proposal for this year's budget in the fall, the final amount of the bill was 188 billion markkas. During Eduskunta deliberations, 5.5 billion markkas in expenditures and a deficit of 4 billion markkas were added to the bill. Supplementary budgets issued in the course of the year will push up the total even more. This year the state is saving more than ever. It will use 30-35 billion markkas less money than it would have if last year's saving decisions had not been made. Despite the savings, the final amount of the budget bill in nominal terms is 12 percent larger than the state's final accounts for 1991. In real terms, i. e., when the rise in prices of public expenditures is taken into account, the government's original objective will be exceeded by nearly 10 percent. Last year government expenditures were 202 billion markkas, tax revenues 100 billion, and other revenues 35 billion markkas. The gap of 67 billion markkas that was generated was filled by borrowing. The rate of increase in government debt is stabilizing. This year the government's need for borrowing is approximately the same as last year. At its greatest the year before last it was necessary to borrow 72 billion markkas.
