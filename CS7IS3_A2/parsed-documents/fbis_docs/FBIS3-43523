On 6 January, the government announced a two-week postponement of the elections because of the "delay in making certain material arrangements, especially the preparation and distribution of individual voter's cards." The elections are now scheduled to take place on 6 and 20 February. "The new dates must be revised because there have been several days of blockage," Mr. Kodjo told AFP, adding that "any further action will depend on how the government resolves the current security problem which may create obstacles in the pre-electoral period." Meanwhile, "the CAR has taken note of the government's decision to postpone the election by 15 days to allow better preparations for the legislative elections," but it "deplores the fact that the delay is taking effect at a time when all sectors of the country are paralized." Answering questions by AFP, Mr. Agboyibor said that "the bodies set up to organize the elections cannot profitably use the new delay." The radical opposition has already reiterated its decision to boycott the legislative elections despite the postponement. Leopold Gnininvi of the Group of Pan-African Social Democrats, a three-party coalition, and Antoine Folly of the Union for Democracy and Solidarity believe that "the postponement announced does in no way improve the situation: It neither restores the rule of law nor creates conditions for equitable elections."
