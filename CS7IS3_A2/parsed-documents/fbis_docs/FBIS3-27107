When the Year of the Rooster is replaced by the Year of the Dog, another green spring is coming. The first solar term of the Beginning of Spring has passed and the Spring Festival has also passed. Farm work all over the vast land of China is getting busy from the south to the north. The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee made a decision on the establishment of the socialist market economic structure, and the 29th to 36th points of the decision especially discuss the rural work and the rural economy. The central rural work conference also made concrete arrangements for rural work and the rural economy. After that, the party Central Committee and the State Council adopted a number of policies and measures for rural work and the rural economy. All this came like the life-giving spring breeze and rain, and brought spring to the vast rural areas ahead of time. What, then, are the main tasks in our current rural work? They may be summarized in five phrases. That is, stabilizing and improving basic policies; deepening reform; solving prominent contradictions; concentrating strength to develop the rural economy; and strengthening the position of agriculture as the foundation for the national economy. In particular, the link of deepening reform will play a leading and guiding role, because the settlement of many things in rural work and the rural economy have to rely on the deepening of reform. As for deepening reform, for the time being, we should give consideration mainly to the following three issues: First, promoting the reasonable movement of production factors, giving play to peasant initiative and rural economic units, raising labor productivity and the utilization rate of all sorts of resources. The joint-stock cooperative system is a new thing in the course of reform, and it should be further advanced on the basis of summing up experience. The most important thing for township and town enterprises is to adopt flexible operational mechanisms, which must not be given up. Of course, they should continue to explore new organizational forms, rationalize property rights relationships, and give better play to competitive mechanisms. Second, establishing and perfecting the rural market system. The most important thing in this regard is to create good linkages between the rural and urban markets and between industry and agriculture. The hundreds of millions of peasant households should be properly linked with the big markets. At present, various localities have created various forms of agriculture-industry-trade integration and integrated production-supply-marketing systems. They should be further developed. Third, it is necessary to establish a state system for guiding, protecting, regulating, controlling, and serving agriculture, with stress laid on protection and service. In the whole country, this year's reform intensity and depth will be unprecedented. We can say that this year will be a reform year in real terms. In this important year, we must properly handle the relationship between reform, development, and stability, and must maintain a stable political environment and a favorable economic environment. To achieve this purpose, we must first stabilize agriculture, ensure the sufficient supply of farm products, prevent prices from fluctuating too violently and keep price changes within the scope of social endurance. Therefore, it is never a stereotyped expression to call for strengthening the position of agriculture as the foundation for the national economy and strengthening the rural work. We must never neglect agriculture when the agricultural situation is good, and must always attach importance to agriculture when facing arduous tasks. An important link in the adjustment of the economic structure is the proportions allotted to agriculture and industry, in which the proportion of agriculture in the national economy as a whole should be increased. This is not only related to agriculture but also to industry. At present, industry is not only facing a shortage of funds, but more importantly, it is also facing a market problem. Industrial products do not sell well and seriously over stockpiled. Then, where is the biggest market for industrial goods? It is in the vast rural areas. Without setting the rural market in motion, we will not have a stable foundation for industrial development, and the market for industrial products will shrink. Therefore, adjusting the structure and strengthening agriculture must not be just empty talk. From the central to local authorities, all must adopt the guideline and concrete measures for strengthening agriculture.
