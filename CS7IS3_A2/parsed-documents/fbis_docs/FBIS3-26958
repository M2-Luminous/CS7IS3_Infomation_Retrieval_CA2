This is an important meeting in the process of reform, opening, and economic development in this region. The tasks of the conference are to: Comprehensively implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the national economic work conference; analyze the current economic situation; arrange this year's economic work; and mobilize cadres and the masses in Ningxia to further emancipate their minds, unify their thinking, grasp the opportunity, quicken reform and development, and create a new situation in the economic work of this region. Party and government leaders of the autonomous region Huang Huang, Bai Lichen [chairman of the regional government], Ma Qizhi, Ma Xiguang, Wang Yu, Ma Wenxue, and Liu Zhong attended the meeting. Wang Qixing, vice chairman of the autonomous region government, presided over the opening session. Responsible comrades from all prefectural, city, and county governments and departments in charge of economic work; leaders of all relevant regional departments; representatives of large and medium industrial enterprises in Ningxia; and responsible comrades from the democratic parties, totalling over 300 people, attended the meeting. At the opening session, Bai Lichen, chairman of the regional government, delivered an important speech entitled: "Deepening Reform, Adjusting Thoughts, Grasping the Opportunity, and Accelerating Development." The speech was divided into five major parts. While analyzing the current economic situation, Bai Lichen pointed out: In 1993, we comprehensively implemented the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress and continued to carry out the instructions Comrade Deng Xiaoping gave on his inspection tour to the south; we also made positive explorations regarding the establishment of the socialist market economy and made major progress in this region's economic and social development. On the basis of the economic recovery [hui sheng 0932 0581] in 1992, economic growth moved onto a faster lane last year and the GDP for the whole year reached 9.5 billion yuan, an increase of 10 percent over the previous year and exceeding the target of 9 percent. The output value of primary industry increased by 4.5 percent; that of secondary industry increased by 13.2 percent; and that of the tertiary industry increased by 9.2 percent. Local financial revenue reached 1.08 billion yuan, increasing by 40.6 percent over the previous year. When affirming that the region's economy was developing healthily and stably, Bai Lichen also analyzed the existing difficulties and problems in the course of economic development: People's thinking was still not completely free from the shackles of the old concepts and systems and was still not commensurate with the requirements of the new situation; the pace of reform was not quick enough and some deep problems in economic life have not been thoroughly solved; a considerable number of state- owned enterprises have not effectively transformed their management mechanisms and continue to incur serious business losses due to poor management and poor economic efficiency; and no marked results were achieved in handling the "bottleneck" problems which constrained economic growth with some becoming even more serious. This year, reform in the whole country will make advances across the board and breakthroughs will be made in some key areas; economic construction will enter a new development period as the process of establishing the socialist market economic structure will be quickened; and this region will also grasp the opportunity to advance reforms and accelerate development. In his speech, Bai Lichen said: According to the "Decision" adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the spirit of the national economic work conference, the guideline for this year's economic work in Ningxia is: Follow the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory about building socialism with Chinese characteristics, profoundly implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the national economic work conference, further emancipate our minds, advance reforms across the board, expand opening to the outside world, adjust the structure in an intensive way, enhance the economic efficiency, take firms steps to build the basic framework of the socialist market economic structure, and promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy [chi xu kuai su jian kang 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660] development of the region's economy. The second part of Bai Lichen's speech called for deepening understanding, emancipating the minds, and boosting morale to meet the new opportunities and challenges. When analyzing the favorable and unfavorable impact of the international and domestic situations on this region's reform and development, he pointed out seriously that, apart from being constrained by certain objective conditions, people still lack the sense of market and have not yet emancipated their minds thoroughly. They are still affected by the traditional concepts of the planned economy over a long period of time, so they are slow to react under the new situation and lack a sense of crisis and urgency. This is a major obstacle to our current work. In order to accelerate development, such mental obstacles must be removed; otherwise, we shall not be able to make advances. Only through substantial emancipation of the minds can great developments be made in reform and economic construction. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt the concepts of reform and development, to increase the sense of competition and efficiency, and to adopt the concepts of self-strengthening, self-reliance, and self-development. It is also necessary to be fully aware of the favorable conditions, increase confidence, and boost morale. We must be bold in making advances and we must not hesitate and let opportunities slip. We cannot slow down reform because we are afraid of difficulties and continue to wait; cannot slow down development by holding a negative attitude of complaining about the difficulties; and we cannot see the widening of the gap between this region and other localities by having a parochial and complacent attitude. In the third part of his speech, Bai Lichen called for intensifying reforms, advancing reforms across the board, making breakthroughs in key areas, and quickening the pace of establishing the socialist market economic structure. He said: This year will witness the adoption of more reform measures than in the past 10 years and more and the breadth, depth, difficulty, and intensity of reform will all be unprecedented. Our main reform task is to further deepen the enterprise reform and more rapidly establish the modern enterprise system. This is a key point and also a difficult point in the economic structural reform of this region. We must take major actions and adopt decisive measures to strive for major breakthroughs. We shall conscientiously reform the financial and taxation system, steadily advance the banking reform, quicken the reform of the investment system, deepen the reform of the foreign trade system, more quickly establish the social guarantee system, and further advance the price reform. Bai Lichen stressed: When advancing reforms in all fields, it is necessary to properly handle the relationship between reform, development, and stability. We must effectively advance reforms while keeping stability, and, in turn, promote social stability through deepening reform and accelerating development. The reforms for the establishment of the socialist market economic structure will inevitably produce a major impact on economic development in this region. Therefore, in the fourth part of his speech, Bai Lichen said that we should act positively in compliance with the reform trend, increase the intensity of adjustments according to the actual conditions of this region, sort out our ideas and plans, fix a clear and correct orientation, and effectively shift the economic work to the path of being focused on the enhancement of economic efficiency. First, we should renew our understanding of the conditions of this region, adjust the investment structure, and use the limited financial resources on the projects which will yield the best returns. Second, we should constantly take enhancement of economic efficiency as the central link in our economic work and give top priority to optimizing the structure, strengthening management, and enhancing efficiency. Third, foreign trade should produce effects in nurturing production development so that the Ningxia economy can be linked with the international market. Fourth, new economic growth points should be fostered and the individual and private economies and the township and town enterprises should be developed greatly. Fifth, great efforts should be made to foster and develop the market system and to raise the market-oriented proportion of the economy. In the fifth part of his speech, Bai Lichen required governments and departments at all levels to transform their functions more intensively and improve their style of work more effectively, thus guaranteeing the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the economy. In this regard, Bai Lichen stressed three major points: First, it is necessary to quicken the administrative structure reform of the governments in the course of functional transformation. Government functions must be separated from enterprise management and the administrative structure should be streamlined and unified so that higher work efficiency can be achieved. Through reform, we will establish a new administrative structure which is suited to the requirements of the socialist market economy and functions flexibly and efficiently. Second, it is necessary to change the style of work effectively and strive to improve the work quality. Local governments and departments at all levels should overcome seriously the superficial style of saying more than doing, issuing general calls rather than giving concrete guidance, and they should resolutely overcome the bureaucratic and formalistic style in their administrative work. Leaders at all levels should spend more time on making in-depth investigations and studies in grass-roots units and among the masses and should pay more attention to settling concrete problems in the work. It is necessary to make qualitative and quantitative analyses, find out the position of their own departments in the whole country and find out their shortcomings, work out feasible measures, and adopt the target responsibility system. It is also necessary to bear in mind the overall interests and properly handle the relationship between the overall interests and the local or departmental interests, thus ensuring the smooth implementation of all reform measures. Third, it is necessary to use both hands to grasp the work and to keep both hands tough. At present, it is necessary to use the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics to educate cadres and the masses; form the consensus of understanding, supporting, and participating in reform in the whole society; and actually turn the reform measures into the conscious actions of the masses. While concentrating on reform, opening, and economic construction, it is also necessary to attach importance to education, science and technology, culture, public health, family planning, and the work in other fields. Finally, Bai Lichen said: We are now in a crucial historical period and are facing arduous reform and development tasks. Doing the economic work well this year is of great significance for Ningxia's future development. As long as we further emancipate our minds, seek truth from facts, maintain unity, boldly break new ground, and handle our work in all fields in a down-to-earth manner, then we shall certainly be able to fulfill all tasks; effect the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the economy in this region; and take new steps in the course of establishing the socialist market economic structure.
