Before leaving Romania for Albania, Tinca and Joulwan met with journalists in the Byzantine Hall of the National Military Circle and held a news conference. In his opening statement Tinca extended heartfelt thanks to the U.S. general for the talks and said that the first visit by the supreme commander of allied forces in Europe beyond the borders of the NATO member states, that is, to Romania, has clear political significance. It is considered recognition of our country's geostrategic importance in this region. The Romanian minister mentioned that during the talks the sides had discussed the political and economic situation in Romania and stressed the irreversible nature of options for a democratic system, pluralism, and market economy. During the talks the guests were told about the importance of foreign financial support this year for relaunching Romania's economy. Likewise, the Romanian side described plans to reorganize the army, taking into account its new status as a fundamental institution of the rule-of-law state. Tinca said that an important topic of the talks was the Partnership for Peace [PFP] program. He stressed that our county views this formula as an element ensuring the consolidation of stability in this area. The Romanian minister noted that the sides had assessed the intention of Russia and other countries to sign the PFP framework document as a positive element and a new element in the actions to strengthen stability in Europe. Tinca said that the guests were informed about the current stage in preparing the document of Romania's presentation, which will be approved very soon by Romania's Supreme Defense Council and then sent to Brussels. The defense minister stressed that General Joulwan views the Romanian Army's orientation toward developing relations with the armies of its neighboring countries as an element that helps to increase confidence and good neighborliness. The defense minister reported that the U.S. general had visited the Romanian peacekeeping battalion, which, together with the other two battalions that are to be established soon, will be trained in accordance with a joint concept for peacekeeping operations organized by NATO. In his statement, Gen. Joulwan again stressed that he had chosen Romania for his first visit outside NATO first of all because our country had showed its willingness to join the PFP and because of its important position in Europe. The general mentioned that during his talks with Romania's president, prime minister, defense minister, and chief of general staff he had noted a consistent team that is concerned with the PFP, achieving peace through freedom, and the commitment to continue this partnership. Gen. Joulwan also noted that in leaving Romania he was taking with him a clear impression of Romania's commitment to respect this program. In the second part of the news conference, Gen. Joulwan said in answering reporters' questions that in the PFP, treatment will be equal for all partner states, including the Russian Federation when it signs the document, and he expressed the hope that this would take place this month. Gen. Joulwan mentioned that the decision to participate in the PFP is a matter for each sovereign nation. Regarding specific ways to implement the Partnership program, an issue raised during the talks in Bucharest by the NATO dignitary, speaking on behalf of NATO, he noted that one must first see our country's document of presentation, which will include Romania's strategy or desire to carry out a number of military activities, and then a working plan will be established to include all requirements. Tinca wished to stress that the PFP makes an indirect contribution to prosperity. Since the PFP is directed toward everyone equally, it will help preserve stability and will strengthen the sense of security. Thus Central and East European countries will be able to concentrate on development and the continuation of reform. The climate of stability, the Romanian national defense minister added, will have positive effects also regarding foreign investors. In connection with the tragedy in the former Yugoslavia, Gen. Joulwan said that this worries everybody and the only solution is diplomatic and political and not military. He said that all efforts must be in the direction of reaching solutions solely through negotiations.
