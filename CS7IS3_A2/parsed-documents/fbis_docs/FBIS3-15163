Afterward, Marchuk said in particular during an interview with journalists that the situation in Crimea would have been much more complex if "certain actions" had not been taken. "The problem of Crimea and of regionalization as a whole is one of those kind of threats which is of prime importance to Ukraine, owing to economic, historical, and other reasons," Yevhen Marchuk said. He is also convinced that there are no grounds for dramatizing the situation, since Ukraine has the force to prevent the development of events similar to those in Yugoslavia. The head of the SBU is convinced that only the strategic internal policy of the Ukrainian leadership in its attitude not only toward Crimea but also toward other regions, in particular the Donbass, Transcarpathia, and Bukovina, could speedily neutralize a threat to the decentraliztion of the state. In an interview with a UNIAN correspondent, Yevhen Marchuk confirmed that he had a meeting last week with people from Yevhen Saburov's entourage, who had been invited by Yuriy Meshkov to take up the post of vice premier of Crimea. The SBU head declined to comment on the subject discussed. Yevhen Marchuk also said that the security service has information ("details, personalities, names and numbers") about the fact that foreign structures are attempting to interfere in Ukraine's election campaign, "beside our own native criminal capital." In his words, the security service will make use of its entire mechanism to uncover such facts. In reply to a question from a UNIAN correspondent about how the SBU intends to counteract such manifestations, Yevhen Marchuk said: "This will be done with specific state of the art methods until evidence is gathered. Only then will we publicly reveal such facts." Yevhen Marchuk gave assurances that "the SBU would pass some information on certain parliamentary candidates to the Central Electoral Commission and leaders of political parties on whose behalf these candidates are running." He stressed that they "are talking about specific facts and cases rather than interference by the security services in the election campaign."
