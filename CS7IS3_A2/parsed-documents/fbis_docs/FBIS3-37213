Such decisions must be adopted by the U.N. Security Council," says a statement by the Russian Foreign Ministry, circulated here as a document of the Security Council on Monday [14 February]. "The NATO Council has adopted a statement on the Bosnian crisis problem. The council has urged all the sides involved --the Serbs and the Moslems -- to urgently place all their heavy armaments in Sarajevo district under U.N. control and to withdraw them from the city. This, in fact, is close to our stand. Russia has repeatedly advanced the initiative to urgently demilitarise Sarajevo and place the city under U.N. administrative control. We regard such measures as the most important step leading to the settlement of the Bosnian conflict as a whole. We are also pleased that the NATO Council, just as Russia, has confirmed its support to the idea of settling the conflict in Bosnia through negotiations. This calls for the world community's vigorous pressure on all the sides involved in the conflict. Unfortunately, an attempt to interpret this statement as a unilateral ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs, who are threatened by air strikes, can be traced in the positions of several NATO members. The Russian Federation cannot agree with such one-sidedness," the statement points out. The Russian Foreign Ministry stresses: "We are also sure that the Security Council should adopt, as we have proposed two weeks ago, decisions on the problem of de-blocking Sarajevo. Unfortunately, Russia's proposal was not accepted. This problem was at the same time submitted to the NATO council which, as we know, is not vested with the right to adopt decisions on the essence of the Bosnian settlement. The U.N. secretary-general had previously asked NATO to report on the alliance's readiness to use its Air Force if requested by the United Nations. A decision on such a request must be adopted by the secretary-general after consultations with members of the Security Council. This procedure, established by the Security Council, must be observed without fail." The document notes that reports were received a few hours before the announcement on the NATO decision that the Bosnian Serbs and the Moslems had reached, with U.N. mediation, an agreement to cease fire, and had agreed on concrete measures to withdraw their armaments from Sarajevo. "The hasty decision, adopted outside the United Nations, may thwart this promising process. Progress towards a settlement is possible only if neither side gets advantages in the process of demilitarisation, effected by U.N. Forces," the document stresses. The Russian Federation, the statement points out, offers the U.N. Security Council to urgently consider "practical ways to demilitarise Sarajevo and establish U.N. administration in it".
