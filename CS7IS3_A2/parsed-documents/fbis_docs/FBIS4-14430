Terekhov, has been formed in the Gray House. Information about the course of its work has been promised within the next few days when the document on "reorganization" is finally ready. Well, the "victims" have a viewpoint regarding this as well. In the words of V. Gilgenberg, he has not seen the decree for his ouster. After moving out of the city manager's office, from which he managed to remove his personal belongings and money, Vladimir Aleksandrovich filed charges in the Frunzenskiy Rayon court against the deputy chief of the kray, I. Lebedinets, regarding his discharge. As it turned out, I. Lebedinets had signed no such decree, and so the charges were filed against the wrong person. They were transferred to the Leninskiy Rayon people's court, which will obviously submit an inquiry to the city administration which is located on the territory of this rayon. It is assumed that the corresponding directive was issued by acting city chief K. Tolstochein, and the question of the legality of firing Gilgenberg should be addressed to him. Further, V. Gilgenberg filed charges against the deputy chief of the kray, I. Lebedinets, in the Frunzenskiy Rayon court concerning the illegality, in the plaintiff's opinion, of Lebedinets' decree appointing K. Tolstochein as acting chief of the city, since effective 14 March, on instructions from V. Cherepkov, who had gone into the hospital, his duties were to be performed by V. Gilgenberg. In addition, Gilgenberg sent three applications to the city procurator and also the kray procurator. The latter was addressed also to the president, the chairmen of the Duma and the Council of the Federation of the Russian Federation, and the procurator general. They also discuss the illegality of the ouster of both Gilgenberg himself and the other workers of the mayor's office. Moreover, the former manager insisted on having I. Lebedinets removed from his position and bringing criminal charges against him for statements that violate, in the plaintiff's opinion, the principles of "racial and ethnic equal rights." The chief of the city administration for public education, N. Beletskiy, reported that on 22 March two workers of the mayor's office accompanied by a militia detail headed by the deputy chief of the Leninskiy Rayon internal affairs department, S. Goncharuk, had tried twice to kick him out of his office and no documents were presented either for his dismissal or for staff cutbacks. In Beletskiy's words, administration workers "defended" him. This incident was the occasion for the appeal from N. Beletskiy to the city procurator, representatives of the State Duma, and the investigator of the Procuracy General of the Russian Federation. The former chairman of the city committee for administration of property, P. Bezukladnikov, was "luckier": He was given, in his words, an order firing him (No. 356 of 17 March), signed by K. Tolstochein. Effective 18 March the former chief, A. Sazhnov, was returned to the office. P. Bezukladnikov filed charges with the Leninskiy Rayon people's court against acting chief of the city administration K. Tolstochein concerning the illegality of his dismissal.
