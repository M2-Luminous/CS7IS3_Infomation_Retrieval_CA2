Nontraditional exports, which already total $190 million, have experienced an increase in amount, value, and variety. The export of services for 1994 will experience a 5-percent increase if current figures prevail. Duty-free zone activities will grow, but not as much as in 1993, and the volume of oil carried by pipeline will decrease as anticipated. A growth in tourism will remain moderate. Concerning imports, the collection of tariffs and sales taxes indicate a 15-percent increase. (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 17 June 94 p 8 A)
