FR941107-1-00022 FR941107-1-00007 Other disclosure documents include legal proceedings disclosure requirements separate from those found in Regulation S&hyph;K or Regulation S&hyph;B. Schedule 14D&hyph;1, 54 the tender offer schedule adopted in 1977, 55 requires disclosure if during the last five years the person filing the schedule was convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors), or was the subject of a judicial or administrative order that enjoined future violations of, or prohibited activities subject to, federal or state securities laws, or that included findings of violations of those laws. In 1978, Schedule 13D was amended to include legal proceedings disclosure provisions comparable to those included in Schedule 14D&hyph;1, 56 and when Schedule 13E&hyph;3, for going private transactions, 57 was adopted in 1979, the same disclosure was required. 58 Unlike the Regulation S&hyph;K Item 401(f) requirements, disclosure is required of the enumerated proceedings without regard to the filer's determination as to their materiality, and disclosure of administrative proceedings is not limited to suspensions or bars exceeding 60 days. 54 17 CFR 240.14d&hyph;100. 55 Release No. 33&hyph;5844 (July 21, 1977) [42 FR 38341]. 56 Release No. 33&hyph;5925 (April 21, 1978) [43 FR 18484]. 57 17 CFR 240.13e&hyph;100. 58 Release No. 33&hyph;6100 (August 2, 1979) [44 FR 46736]. The offering circular furnished to investors at or prior to the offer or sale of securities made in reliance upon an exemption under Regulation A was amended in 1981 to require legal proceedings disclosure. 59 Issuers are required to disclose in the circular criminal convictions, the initiation of bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings, and appointments of receivers if those actions involved any director, person nominated to become a director or executive officer, if the information is material to an evaluation of the person's ability or integrity, and if the action was taken within the past five years. 60 59 Release No. 33&hyph;6340 (August 7, 1981) [46 FR 41766]. This requirement currently is found in Offering Circular Model B, Part II of Form 1&hyph;A, the Regulation A Offering Statement [17 CFR 239.90]. On April 28, 1993, the Commission adopted Form SB&hyph;1 [17 CFR 239.9], an optional registration form for use by certain small businesses. See Release No. 33&hyph;6996 (April 28, 1993) [58 FR 26509]. Form SB&hyph;1 affords filers the option of providing the disclosure required by the Model B offering circular found in Form 1&hyph;A, including its legal proceedings disclosure requirements. 60 Issuers not subject to Exchange Act reporting obligations that sell securities pursuant to an exemption in accordance with Section 230.505 or Section 230.506 of Regulation D (governing the limited offer and sale of securities without registration under the Securities Act [17 CFR 230.501&hyph;230.508]) to a purchaser that is not an accredited investor must provide the disclosure, including legal proceedings information, required by Regulation A (if the issuer is eligible to rely on that exemption) or by the prospectus requirements of the registration statement the issuer is eligible to use. III. Proposed Amendments The amendments proposed today would retain and clarify current legal proceedings disclosure requirements, expand the scope of existing provisions, and lengthen the time period for which disclosure is required. With one exception, 61 the proposals also would delete the provisions permitting a registrant to omit disclosure where it concludes that the information would not be material to investors in evaluating the ability and integrity of management, 62 or would not be material to a voting or investment decision. 63 Consequently, under the proposals, like other line item disclosure requirements, information concerning legal proceedings would be required if specified by the item. 64 61 See discussion of bankruptcy and insolvency disclosure in Section III.A.1, below. 62 Current Item 401; current Item 8(d) of Part II, Offering Circular (Model B), Form 1&hyph;A. 63 Current Item 401(g) (1) and (2). The provisions of Item 401(g) requiring disclosure of legal proceedings involving promoters and control persons of newly public companies would be incorporated into proposed Item 401(f). See proposed Item 401(f)(2). 64 Current Instruction 2 to Item 401(f), which states that registrants may voluntarily advise the staff that the disclosure was not required based on a determination that it is not material to an investment or voting decision, would be inapplicable to most disclosure requirements. The substance of the instruction would be moved to a note to the bankruptcy provisions found in proposed Item 401(f)(1)(i). The proposed amendments would require disclosure of any identified legal proceeding unless it was subsequently reversed, suspended, vacated, annulled or otherwise rendered of no effect, 65 and would codify the current staff interpretation that disclosure is not required if a conviction is reversed. The proposals also would make it clear that disclosure is required while a legal proceeding is pending appeal. 66 65 See proposed Item 401(f)(1), representing a consolidation of similar provisions found in paragraphs (3), (4), (5) and (6) of current Item 401(f). Under current and proposed rules, an order or sanction need not be disclosed if it has been reversed or otherwise set aside on the basis of the underlying law or facts. However, a registrant must disclose a permanent injunction involving a designated person during the entire disclosure period even if equitable relief from the injunction has been granted before the close of such period. 66 Instruction 1 to Item 401(f) would be amended to indicate that disclosure of final convictions, orders, judgments, decrees or sanctions is required from the date of entry. If appealed, disclosure would continue to be required. If ultimately reversed, suspended, vacated, annulled or otherwise rendered of no effect, disclosure no longer would be required. Disclosure of preliminary orders, judgments, decrees and sanctions would be required from the date that any right to appeal the preliminary action expired. Currently, it is the practice to disclose legal proceedings background information for each general partner of a partnership and each trustee of a real estate investment trust. A new instruction would be added to codify this practice and to expand the requirement to provide such disclosure with respect to trustees of any registrant that is a trust, as well as any other persons providing comparable services to such entities. Disclosure also would be required relating to any person who performs, either directly or indirectly, director or executive officer functions pursuant to a management contract, service contract, such as those used by asset-backed pools, or otherwise. 67 67 See proposed Instruction 5 to Item 401(f).
