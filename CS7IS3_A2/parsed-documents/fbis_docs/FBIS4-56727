Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino is here to talk a bit about this. We welcome him to our studios on 50th Street. [Mulino] Thank you. [Nenzen] Mr. Foreign Minister, you have had very close contacts with the international observers who arrived in our country. What were their expectations of this electoral process before arriving in Panama? [Mulino] Yes, Jenia. I have talked with many international observers from different groups and with different levels of importance in recent days. When they came to Panama they thought they would find things that are quite different from what they actually found. They thought they would find a difficult electoral process with some degree of violence; and they had doubts about how things would go; but many of them were able to witness how the different candidates ended their campaigns. Likewise, they have talked with many Panamanians from different political groups; and all of them, without exception, coincide on various issues. First of all, there has been a very high voter turnout. This was something we were able to confirm today at the different polling places. Second, the honesty with which this process has been carried out and the way the elections have ended today without any doubts. People have participated; they have voted; no one was afraid of being insulted or having their vote ridiculed. Moreover, the confidence that the different political groups have given the Electoral Tribunal has been reasserted by all the candidates and all the political parties. I believe that, as Panamanians, we should feel quite satisfied. We should feel quite pleased with the high degree of maturity we have demonstrated up to this point in an electoral campaign that everyone foresaw as being much more difficult than it has been. Furthermore, it is important to emphasize, and I am pleased about this as foreign minister of the Republic, that our country behaved marvelously in the eyes of the world, meaning as a country that has matured; a country in which citizens have civically exercised their rights; and, above all, a country that has decided -- because the polling places have already closed -- to elect its leaders with freedom, without fear. This is quite different from what we experienced in 1989. In addition, I think it is important to emphasize and acknowledge the role of those who deserve it. First of all, the three Electoral Tribunal magistrates and the organization they have led. I think the country can sleep peacefully tonight after its hard work. Second, the pledge acquired and fulfilled until now and, I am sure, until the end of the process, by the president of the Republic. I think his figure and name will go down in history as the president who respected the people's will; and as the president of the Republic who, after many decades, lead an electoral process without flaws, without doubts. I am sure he will turn over power on 1 September, as he has said on many occasions, to whoever the Panamanian people elect today. [Nenzen] Does this mean you believe the honesty of this electoral process will help counter the international criticism of our country? Do you think this criticism will be eclipsed by the honesty of this electoral process, which has been truly historic? Is this what the international observers will report to their respective countries? [Mulino] That is right. In fact, I have asked them to do so, not only in my role as foreign minister but also as a Panamanian. The main results of their work should be that tomorrow they tell the world, without beating around the bush and with realism, what they have seen and what they have observed in these elections. I believe this will tremendously help to favorably and positively depict Panama at the world level. Obviously, as we conclude our term, we also see with great pleasure how we leave Panama -- once more in harmony with other free nations; without diplomatic or political problems with any country in the world; and, above all, respected, because we have consistently stated and implemented the democratic principles of liberty and respect for human rights that we have professed in our various efforts throughout the world. [Nenzen] To conclude, Mr. Foreign Minister, what message do you send the community in general? There are observers in Panama; the eyes of the world are on our country. What should the people's behavior be when the winner is announced? [Mulino] I think that is the culmination of this entire process. When the Electoral Tribunal announces who has won the elections, the six losers must immediately go and congratulate -- without problems -- the candidate who won. I believe this will confirm Panamanian democracy and, evidently, when the new president of the Republic is sworn in for the next five-year constitutional term on 1 September, he is duty bound to lead the country democratically. I think this is what the Panamanians, regardless of the electoral preference they exercised today, will demand from the next president. He must lead the country with the same degree of liberty and the same sense of democracy that President Guillermo Endara has done in this harsh, complex, and many times misunderstood political transition. [Nenzen] Yes. The next president of the Republic, the 53d president, must maintain and improve our country's international image, aside from meeting most of our people's needs. [Mulino] That is correct.
