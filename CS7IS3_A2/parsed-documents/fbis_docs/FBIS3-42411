A report was delivered by Lieutnenant-General S. Pshenichnikov, chief of the Personnel Training and Assignments Directorate of the Ground Troops. We are publishing a report on that address. The degree to which the forces are manned with officers, their professional preparation, efficiency and sense of responsibility are the determining factors with respect to ensuring combat readiness and accomplishing the missions involved in training and indoctrinating the personnel. This is precisely why the upbringing and placement of military cadres is one of the most important areas of work for commanders and chiefs at all levels. The changes occurring in the nation and in the armed forces, however, have produced major changes in the organization and the execution of the work performed with the officer corps and greatly exacerbated many personnel problems and service issues. More than 58,000 officers were discharged from the Ground Troops during the period 1990-1992, around 26,000 (44.9 percent) of them junior officers, an absolute majority of whom were below the age of 30. A total of 7,603 officers were released into the reserve during the first six months of 1993, including 4,082 (53.7 percent) junior officers. The number of young officers in the officer corps of the Ground Troops has dropped 9% during the past year. Together with the reduction in the number of military school graduates entering the troops, this has created an adverse situation with respect to manning the positions of platoon commanders and other primary officer positions. The seriousness of the problem lies in the fact that there are at the present time no realistic possibilities or sources for making up the shortage of officers to man the primary positions. The capacity of the Ground Troops' schools was calculated several years back based on a natural attrition of 4-5% of the officers, and at the present time it does not meet the requirements of the troops. There is only one way out of the situation: to organize specific, focused work with civilian school graduates who have studied in the military departments. Most of them are now receiving a noncommitting diploma and, due to the drop in production, are having certain difficulties in finding jobs. This creates the essential basis for acquiring candidates for military service under contract. Success depends primarily upon our ability to get in touch with the people. First of all, it is necessary to proceed from the premise that as a rule the reserve officer signs a contract with the command element of the military unit at his place of residence. Upon signing a type-B or type-C contract, the officer may not be transferred to a different unit or garrison. At the same time, if the officer experiences housing difficulties, he can be provided with service housing or paid for the cost of renting. When explaining the financial and material payments and benefits, it is essential to provide specific facts and figures to indicate not only the amount of pay for the position and officer's rank but also other advantages: The payment of a one-time monetary bonus for the year's results, material assistance, payment for travel on city and suburban transport, as well as travel to the place of leave and back, the value of the food ration and clothing allowance issued, special payment for housing and electricity, and so forth. With this approach there is a basis for comparison, and in view of the present social and economic difficulties this kind of specific work for selecting civilian VUZ graduates and signing contracts with them to serve in the army is producing good results. Another aspect of the problem, which has to do with the service of the young officers, is the ability and the desire of commanders to work with them, to demonstrate concern for and give attention to their problems and requests. If the commander gets to know each newcomer and is able to deal with his needs not as a formality but sincerely and paternally, the officer will serve conscientiously, with desire and initiative. If not, we shall have another candidate for early release into the reserve. This is why it is essential to do everything possible properly -- to receive and assign the young officers, to help them in their service development and with their material and personal matters. Only by demonstrating real concern for retaining the army's young cadres and working actively to attract personnel for service under contract will we succeed in solving the problem of manning the primary officer positions. Working with officers assigned to the jurisdiction of commanders in connection with the conduct of organizational and establishment measures continues to be the most important for the command element and personnel agencies. More than 13,000 officer positions will be cut this year under the plan of organizational measures in the Ground Troops. There are already around 6,300 supernumerary officers. In view of the fact that the possibilities of the districts for placing officers, particularly older ones, have practically been exhausted, we must enhance control over the appointment of officers to positions and also accelerate the release into the reserve of officers who have served 20 or more years and are provided with housing. The leading role in this matter must be taken both by commanders and personnel agencies and by the officers in their work with the personnel. It is their common mission not to evade acute questions but to answer them specifically and find solutions acceptable to the officers. Focused individual work with those officers who have served out the established service terms based on age requires particular attention. It is mandatory for everyone to strictly observe the release plan and schedules for conducting talks and sending officers to the VVK [military medical board], because the prompt release of officers into the reserve is the main source of vacancies today. On the other hand, observance of the laws and formal send-offs of those being released into the reserve will demonstrate our concern for them, help them make the difficult transition in life and avert various complaints of violations of the procedure for release into the reserve. By decision of the Commander-in-Chief of the Ground Troops, all officers who have served out the established period at remote sites or in regions with difficult conditions and are included in the replacement plan will be replaced. No changes are permitted in the replacement plans. A directive to that effect has been sent to the district personnel agencies. COPYRIGHT: VOYENNYY VESTNIK No 9 1993
