This is the first time since the introduction of sanctions that such a high-level parliamentary delegation is visiting a foreign country, paying an official visit to such a big country as Russia. [Bozovic] This is correct. I would like to believe that this is not an accident but a result of the knowledge acquired by the deputies of various political factions in the Russian Supreme Soviet, where there is complete unanimity among political factions in understanding our crisis. This understanding especially came to prominence with the demand for the lifting of the sanctions against our country. We indeed encountered complete understanding and full support. This climate in the Russian Supreme Soviet is of enormous importance and influence on changes in certain practical moves in Russian diplomacy. We also learned that from our talks with Mr. Kozyrev and his deputy Churkin. There is a new quality, I would say, in the understanding of our situation when it comes to the Russian legislature and the Russian Government. Prior to this visit, this understanding had primarily been expressed by Russian parliamentarians. This time both of them told us that things are now moving, that events are simply moving, that these events are being moved by logic, because it is difficult to find someone here who understands why Yugoslavia, its citizens, and its economy, should be punished by sanctions and political isolation, and who could possibly benefit from this. Therefore, the visit as a whole, and the talks with Chairman Ribkin and Minister Kozyrev, as well as a large number of political factions, have left us with the belief that the Russian public and Russian politicians have taken a more objective stand. This is in fact the point of our policy. Our policy is not to seek the support of Russia in order to punish others, to punish those who are against Serbian interests in this chaotic civil war, but to secure the same position in the peace process for the Serbian side that is being secured for the other sides. [Cukic] Mr. Bozovic, you indeed had a very prudent, very specific, and if I may say, apparently productive program. In all these talks with all parties, ranging from the Communists to the Democrats, the parties on the extreme left and the parties on the extreme right, in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and in contacts with the representatives of the government -- you and your delegation raised, I think, a new question, not only of the sanctions being lifted, but also of the return of Yugoslavia to international politics. [Bozovic] Yes, this question, these questions are dependent on one another. The return of Yugoslavia and its reintegration into the politics of international institutions is of enormous importance, especially in the further course of the peace process, so that we are not in the situation of constantly being put on trial without having a chance to present facts, to present the truth, or in a way, defend ourselves with the facts. Therefore, it is important that the peace process brings about not only the lifting of the economic sanctions, but also the return of Yugoslavia in international institutions, which was fully accepted in talks in the Russian Parliament. We raised this issue in talks with Mr. Minister [not further specified] and other representatives of the government. It is indeed difficult to understand that it is necessary to maintain the blockade on the (?dialogue), the participation of Yugoslavia and Yugoslav representatives in international institutions. [Cukic] All in all, if a reporter is allowed to conclude, the impression is that you are returning from this exceptionally important political parliamentary visit as an optimist. [Bozovic] Optimism in politics, especially in the conditions under which we exist today, is something that is perhaps not good if there is no reason for it. However, I am an optimist in the sense that I am returning with the belief that people who until recently did not have a good enough understanding of the essence of our crisis understand it better today. Time has also done its part, and so has, I would say, a principled policy on the part of the Yugoslav and Serbian sides. The facts are gradually starting to be important in making political decisions. Therefore I think that this parliamentary visit is important. As you said yourself, this is the first official visit by a Yugoslav parliamentary delegation since the introduction of the sanctions against Yugoslavia. [Cukic] Thank you Mr. Bozovic for this interview for Dnevnik 2 program of the Serbian Television. [Bozovic] Thank you.
