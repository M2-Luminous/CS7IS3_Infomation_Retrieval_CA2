FR941005-2-00132 FR941005-2-00089 The proposed rule change would add a new Section 20 to Part I of Schedule D to define the term ``Nasdaq SmallCap Market security'' or ``SCM security'' to mean any security which (i) satisfies all applicable requirements of Part II of Schedule D other than a Nasdaq National Market security; (ii) is a right to purchase such security; or (iii) is a warrant to subscribe to such security. The current section (20) to Part I of Schedule D would be renumbered as Section (21). The current section (21) to Part I of Schedule D would be renumbered as Section (22) and the term ``NASDAQ'' contained therein would be replaced with the term ``Nasdaq''. Current section (22) to (25) to Part I of Schedule D would be renumbered as Sections (23) to (26,) respectively. The proposed rule change would add a new Section 27 to Part I of Schedule D to define ``The Nasdaq SmallCap Market'' or ``SCM'' to be a distinct tier of The Nasdaq Stock Market comprised of securities that meet the requirements of and are authorized as a Nasdaq SmallCap Market security. The current Section 19 to Part I of Schedule D would be renumbered as Section 28 and amended by replacing the current term ``NASDAQ System'' with the term ``The Nasdaq Stock Market'' or ``Nasdaq''. Proposed Section 28 would define The Nasdaq Stock Market as an electronic securities market comprised of competing market makers whose trading is supported by a communications network linking them to quotation dissemination, trade reporting, and order execution systems. Proposed Section 28 would state that The Nasdaq Stock Market also provides specialized automation services for screen based negotiations of transactions, on-line comparison of transactions, and a range of informational services tailored to the needs of the securities industry, investors and issuers. Proposed Section 28 would also clarify that The Nasdaq Stock Market is comprised of two distinct market tiers of the current NASDAQ System. The first tier of The Nasdaq Stock Market would be ``The Nasdaq SmallCap Market'' or ``SCM''. The second tier of The Nasdaq Stock Market would be the ``Nasdaq National Market'' or ``NNM''. On June 30, 1993, the NASD's corporate subsidiaries that operated and serviced the NASDAQ System, i.e. Nasdaq Inc. and NASD Market Services, Inc., were merged into a single corporation renamed ``The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc.''. 2 To reflect this corporate restructuring, proposed Section 28 would clarify that The Nasdaq Stock Market is operated by The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Association. 2 See, Item 16, Exhibit E to The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc._Annual Amendment to Registration as a Securities Information Processor (``SIP'') attached to the NASD's March 31, 1994 letter from Robert E. Aber, Vice President and General Counsel, The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC. The proposed rule change would insert the proposed new terms, where applicable, throughout Schedule D and other parts of the NASD's rules and regulations, including the Schedules to the By-Laws; Rules of Fair Practice; SOES Rules; ACT Rules; FIPS Rules; Nasdaq International Services; Code of Procedure and Uniform Practice Code. The proposed rule change would apply to all rule filings of the Association or its subsidiary, The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., that are approved prior to or are pending on the date of the Commission's approval of the proposed rule change. Moreover, the numbering of the definition sections are proposed to be amended to reflect any amendment to the definition sections under Part I of Schedule D adopted prior to the approval of the proposed rule changes. The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act in that the proposed rule change is designed to perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest in that the proposed rule change would amend certain current terms and adopt new terms relating to the NASDAQ System in order to more appropriately describe the current technological facilities and services provided by this national securities market. The NASD believes that the proposed new terms will indicate more clearly the current functionality of the NASDAQ System as a market for securities with quotation dissemination, trade reporting, and order execution capability, as well as other specialized automation services for screen-based negotiations of transactions, on-line comparison of transactions, and a range of informational services tailored to the needs of the securities industry, investors and issuers. The proposed new terms would also clarify that The Nasdaq Stock Market is composed of two distinct market tiers, each with different inclusion criteria in different parts of the rules. Finally, the proposed rule change would make clear that The Nasdaq Stock Market is operated by The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Association. (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The NASD does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended. (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others Written comments were neither solicited nor received. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission will: A. by order approve such proposed rule change, or B. institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, D.C. 20549.
