In Bordeaux last Friday, Defense Minister Francois Leotard confirmed that the European Molecular Chemistry Institute (created on the initiative of the Polytechnic School) would be sited in the city. He also announced that a major investment concerning the region would be included in the military planning law. The minister gave no further details. One possibility is the installation of an enormous laser in the region's Atomic Energy Commission [AEC] establishment. Investment Worth 200 Million French Francs The siting in Bordeaux of the Molecular Chemistry Institute was announced two years ago, but the plan then seemed to get bogged down. Certain members of the Paris scientific community put up some resistance to the institute being located in the provinces. Francois Leotard's very clear statements on the subject appear to indicate that these objections have been lifted, and that the institute will indeed be created. Most of the estimated cost of 200 million French francs [Fr] will come from local authorities (the Bordeaux city council, the general council of the Gironde department, and the regional council of Aquitaine) with the European Union also contributing through the European Social Fund, according to the terms of objective 2. Based in Pessac, near the university, in two to three years time the institute will be host to dozens of researchers from the Polytechnic School and the universities of Louvain (Belgium) and Lausanne (Switzerland). The number of researchers and engineers could exceed 200 at the turn of the century. It will serve to considerably strengthen the already not insignificant potential of the region in the solid chemistry field. The other investment announced by Francois Leotard could be worth a great deal more. If the laser theory turns out to be true, the figures could run into billions. Designed for nuclear test simulation, this high-powered device could also be put to other uses by Europe's scientific community.
