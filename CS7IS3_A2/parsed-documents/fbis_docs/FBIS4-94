The American, working for the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), was kidnapped in the Somali capital Mogadishu, the sources said, but without giving further details. The kidnap of the American comes barely a week after the release of a New Zealander and a Kenyan who were held hostage for 16 days by gunmen demanding a one million dollar ransom. But David Morris, the owner of Morris Catering which is contracted by the UN to supply its troops with food and water, said he secured the release of his employees after protracted negotiations by giving the gunmen a few bags of rice and sugar, and a tin of cooking oil. Armed bandits are on the increase here after the withdrawal last week of American and other western forces. Wayne Hargreaves, the New Zealander released last week, said his kidnappers "were a well equipped terrorist group". Meanwhile, five bandits were killed by newly-trained Somali police in the northwestern town of Baidoa on Wednesday, UN military spokesman Chris Budge said on Thursday. The killing occurred after the leader of the bandits tried to coerce aid workers into employing some of his men.
