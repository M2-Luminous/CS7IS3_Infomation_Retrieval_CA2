The manufacture of chemical weapons ended in the former USSR back in 1987. Nonetheless, Russia has inherited 40,000 tons of lethal fluids and gases. These are the biggest stockpiles in the world. The convention stipulates that by the beginning of the next century virtually no chemical weapons stockpiles will remain. Currently preparations for the destruction of these weapons are under way. The coordination of the efforts of ministries and departments has been entrusted to the Committee for Convention Problems. [A. Kuntsevich, chairman of the Committee for Convention Problems Under the Russian President, identified by caption] The expenditure involved runs into trillions. We expect that in the course of the talks between Boris Nikolayevich and Bill Clinton important accords will be reached on problems of U.S. participation in specific areas of our program for the destruction of chemical weapons.
