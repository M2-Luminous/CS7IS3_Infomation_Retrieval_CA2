They were all attending a session. Only the telephone of Aleksandr Sheleg, aide to the first deputy chairman of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet, was answered: "Our Prime Minister Kebich has long upheld the idea of a sound economic partnership. And his initiative for the republic to enter into a single ruble zone with Russia is consistent in this respect. After the breakup of the USSR Belarus effectively remains the sole window into Europe for Russia: The main air, railroad, and automobile routes and pipelines pass through it. We would not be a burden. Our flagships -- the tractor, automobile, and other plants -- are effectively standing idle now. And the same thing is happening in Russia. I am convinced that, if a decision were adopted -- and that is what our industrialists are waiting for -- things would return to life here. And I think Yeltsin realizes this." It has become known that Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin will come to Minsk in the next few days. His visit may herald a definitive decision in favor of unifying the two republics' financial systems.
