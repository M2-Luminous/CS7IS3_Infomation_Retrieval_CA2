The Andean Textile Federation proposed the establishment of minimum quotas and prices to the Cartagena Agreement Board (Junac) to restrict Asian textile imports that enter the region with undervalued prices. The Andean Garment Federation openly opposes that proposal because it believes the free market "is enough to face the unfair competition." The garment industry also believes the quota system "is self-defeating because just as quotas would be imposed on Asian products, quotas could also be imposed on buying raw material in those countries and that would hurt us." An organization spokesman said Junac experts, who apparently will meet in Lima today to discuss the issue, will resolve the disagreement as a last resort.
