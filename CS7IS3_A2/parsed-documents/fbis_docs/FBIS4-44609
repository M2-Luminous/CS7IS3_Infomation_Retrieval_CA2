Prominent among these 16 devices is the GR1342J superradiation light-emitting diode, the first domestically developed superradiation LED meeting early-90s international commercial standards. This new device, fabricated with an epitaxial technique and end-face film depostion, is used as an intermediary between LEDs and laser diodes, and is an ideal light source for fiber optic gyros. Other important devices include the GD3255Y fast-response, high-sensitivity, large-photosensitive-surface non-magnetic photodiode, an embargoed optoelectronic detector used in asdic [i.e. anti-submarine detection] systems; the GZ1140Z broad-passband-range, low-intra-passband-ripple, steep-transition-band CCD [charge-coupled device] recursive filter used in new-generation radar systems; the SK161 coaxial hermetic package used in high-power pulsed laser diodes for key State projects and also for laser diode arrays and LEDs; the GD5281Y high-sensitivity, broad-dynamic-range quadrant avalanche detector [i.e. photodiode] used in missile guidance and tracking, security monitoring, medical diagnosis, and robot vision systems; the GH5200Q zero-light-detection switch; the GH1200Z and two other models of optical couplers; and the GH8740J and one other ac/dc solid state relay.
