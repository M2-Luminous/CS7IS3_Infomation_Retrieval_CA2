A shadow government will work out alternative programs for the country's development and carry out constructive opposition activities towards the present Cabinet, said the movement's leader, Vyacheslav Chornovyl in an interview to Interfax-Ukraine. The Rukh council also decided to "denounce even more the Communist ideology and carry out a resolute struggle with the ruling party which tries to stop the economic reforms". The movement's leadership recommended that primary organizations focus efforts on local elections which will take place on June 26 alongside the presidential ones. Chornovyl believes the Rukh may win the mayors' elections in over 20 large cities and try to win the elections in another 700 constituencies. The council confirmed the intention to vote at the presidential elections against former prime minister Leonid Kuchma and the current parliament speaker Aleksandr Moroz because it believes they pose danger for sovereignty and independence of Ukraine.
