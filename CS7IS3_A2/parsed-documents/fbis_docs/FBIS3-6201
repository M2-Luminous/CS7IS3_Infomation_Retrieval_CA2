Two Chinese nationals were caught last Dec. 21 trying to enter Los Angeles with altered South Korean passports, followed by one in New York and another in Chicago Dec. 29, Foreign Ministry officials and travel agencies said yesterday. Cambodians, Thais and Turks have been caught using South Korean passports in Japan and the United States. Cambodian nationals turned up with four South Korean passports Jan. 8 that were stolen separately in Hong Kong, New York and Seoul, with the latest incidents occurring in Thailand, Belgium, the Philippines and the United States throughout January until Feb. 4. Officials said they believe the passports are being sold on the black market for $1,500 to $2,000 in places like Bangkok and Manila. The concern in Seoul is that due to the rise in illegitimate passports, foreign immigration officials may decide to step up security checks and entry procedures for South Korean passport holders, the officials said.
