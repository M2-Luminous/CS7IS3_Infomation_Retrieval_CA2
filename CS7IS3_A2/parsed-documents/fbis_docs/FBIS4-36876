The Yemeni envoy made a statement to our political affairs correspondent: [Begin recording] [Ghanim] My current visit to the fraternal Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is to convey a message from Presidential Council Chairman 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih to his brother His Majesty King Husayn dealing with the latest developments in the Republic of Yemen, with stopping this war which was ignited by the secessionist rebels, and with the full implementation of the UN Security Council resolution which safeguards Yemen's territorial integrity. [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, is there Yemeni action on the Arab level? [Ghanim] Yes, there is Yemeni action. My visit to Jordan is part of this action. It is the first leg of a tour of a number of fraternal Arab states in order to brief them on the true situation in Yemen. [Correspondent] What is the true situation in Yemen regarding the cease-fire? [Ghanim] The true situation in Yemen is the tragedy that has been caused by some of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leaders through their rebellion and insurgence against the authority and public order. They did this to pave the way for announcing secession in order to take Yemen back to the pre-22 May [1990] era in violation of the Yemeni people's will, the constitution, and the April 1993 elections, which the whole world admitted were clean elections. Regarding the cease-fire, the Republic of Yemen has from the very beginning welcomed the UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire although we are convinced that this resolution is interference in our internal affairs. Despite this, out of our respect for international legitimacy, we welcomed this resolution and complied with it. As of yesterday, the legitimate leadership in the Republic of Yemen had announced a cease-fire three times. Regrettably, every time, the rebels violate this cease-fire, foment sedition, and renew fighting. There objective is to continue the battles to create an appropriate atmosphere to bring forces to disengage both Yemeni sides' troops, or international observers. We consider this a flagrant interference in the internal Yemeni affairs. [Correspondent] In a statement, the UN envoy said that officials in Sanaa accept dialogue, and the other party might accept dialogue. Do you consider this a turning point in the situation in general? [Ghanim] We have accepted dialogue from the beginning. We have never refused to extend our hand for the sake of dialogue and national reconciliation. After the declaration of secession, dialogue has become possible only with the YSP leaders who believe in unity and democracy. However, it is difficult to hold dialogue with the members who do not believe in unity, declared secession, and disavowed democracy. [Correspondent] Thank you Mr. Minister. [end recording]
