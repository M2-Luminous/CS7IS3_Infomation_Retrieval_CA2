FR940822-1-00006 FR940822-1-00002 C. Phase III NCPs The availability of NCPs for 1991 model year HDE standards was addressed during Phase III of the NCP rulemaking (55 FR 46622, November 5, 1990). NCPs were offered for the following: the 1991 HDDE PM standard for petroleum-fueled urban buses, the 1991 HDDE PM standard for petroleum-fueled vehicles other than urban buses, the 1991 petroleum-fueled HDDE NO X standard, and the PM emission standard for 1991 and later model year petroleum-fueled light-duty diesel trucks greater than 3750 lbs loaded vehicle weight (LDDT2s). As discussed in the Phase III preamble, NCPs were also considered but not offered for the methanol-fueled heavy-duty diesel engine and heavy-duty gasoline engine standards as it was concluded that those standards did not meet the eligibility criteria established in the generic rule. In addition, Phase III of the NCP rulemaking described how NCPs would be integrated into the HDE NO X and PM averaging program. D. Phase IV NCPs The availability of NCPs for HDVs and HDEs subject to the 1994 and later model year emission standards for particulate matter (PM) was addressed by Phase IV of the NCP rulemaking (58 FR 68532, December 28, 1993). NCPs were offered for the following: the 1994 and later model year PM standard for heavy-duty diesel engines (HDDEs) used in urban buses, and the 1994 and later model year PM standard for HDDEs used in vehicles other than urban buses. NCPs were also considered, but not offered for the 1994 and later model year methanol-fueled HDE PM standard and the 1994 and later model year cold carbon monoxide (CO) standard for heavy light-duty gasoline fueled trucks. E. NCP Eligibility for 1996 Tier 1 HLDT, 1996 Urban Bus PM, and 1998 HDE NO X , and Later Emission Standards for Petroleum-Fueled HDEs and HDVs NCPs were not considered for the Tier 1 ``in-use'' standards since NCPs are a mechanism to allow manufacturers to certify engine families, not to assist manufacturers in complying with ``in-use'' standards. The remainder of this proposal addresses whether NCPs should be made available for the 1996 Urban Bus PM standard of 0.05 g/BHP-hr, the 1998 HDE NO X standard of 4.0 g/BHP-hr, and the following Tier 1 standards applicable to 1996 HLDTs at the intermediate 1 useful life and at the full 2 useful life: 1 Intermediate useful life is 5 years or 50,000 miles. 2 Full useful life is 11 years or 120,000 miles. A. LDT3 1. Non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC) standard. a. 0.32 g/mi at intermediate useful life; b. 0.46 g/mi at full useful life; 2. Carbon Monoxide (CO) standard. a. 4.4 g/mi at intermediate useful life; b. 6.4 g/mi at full useful life; 3. Oxides of Nitrogen (NO X ) standard. a. 0.70 3 g/mi at intermediate useful life; 3 There is no intermediate useful life standard for diesel-fueled vehicles. b. 0.98 g/mi at full useful life; 4. Particulate Matter (PM) standard of 0.10 g/mi at full useful life; B. LDT4 1. NMHC standard. a. 0.39 g/mi at intermediate useful life; b. 0.56 g/mi at full useful life; 2. CO standard. a. 5.0 g/mi at intermediate useful life; b. 7.3 g/mi at full useful life; 3. NO X standard. a. 1.1 4 g/mi at intermediate useful life; 4 There is no intermediate useful life standard for diesel-fueled vehicles. b. 1.53 g/mi at full useful life; 4. PM standard of 0.12 g/mi at full useful life; EPA's consideration of NCPs for each of these standards is discussed below. a. 1996 Tier 1 Non-Methane Hydrocarbon (NMHC) Standard for LDT3 Since there is no NMHC standard for earlier model year LDT3s, the new NMHC standard represents an increase in stringency over the THC standard for previous model years, satisfying the first eligibility criterion. EPA acknowledges that one manufacturer has indicated that it may have difficulty complying with this standard. Based on the manufacturer's planned strategy, however, EPA does not believe that substantial work, as described above, will be necessary to meet the new standard for either the intermediate useful-life level of 0.32 g/mi or the full useful-life level of 0.46 g/mi, since it does not represent a major modification of existing technology. EPA also does not believe that a technological laggard is likely to develop, based on discussions with vehicle manufacturers. For these reasons, EPA is not proposing to offer NCPs for this standard. b. 1996 Tier 1 CO Standard for LDT3 EPA recognizes that the new CO standard of 6.4 g/mi at full useful life represents an increase in stringency over the prior standard of 10 g/mi at full useful life for LDT3s, satisfying the first eligibility criterion. Based on 1993 model year certification levels, only one manufacturer is currently producing LDT3 vehicles which would not meet the new standard at full useful life. Since this manufacturer does not anticipate difficulty in meeting the new CO standards, EPA does not believe that a technological laggard is likely to develop. The half useful-life standard of 4.4 g/mi is considered by EPA and manufacturers to be less difficult to meet compared with the full useful life standard. For these reasons, EPA is not proposing to offer NCPs for these standards.
