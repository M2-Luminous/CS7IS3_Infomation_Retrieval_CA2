[Tarabayh, interrupting] Concerning the details... [Quray'] Concerning the details, there is now a Palestinian monetary institution that enjoys almost 90 percent of a central bank's powers. With the exception of issuing banknotes, this institution enjoys all of a central bank's jurisdictions and powers. There is now a right to trade with the Arab world, with the Islamic world, and with the foreign world. Consequently, for the first time, borders are now open for Palestinian agricultural products to enter the Israeli market. In the past, the Palestinian market was open to the Israeli agricultural products, but Palestinian products were not allowed to enter the Israeli market. Now, the market is open. Industry has also become the right of the Palestinian authority which decides, defines, and issues licenses. It even defines the standards of the Palestinian industry. There are important issues which....[sentence incomplete as heard] [Tarabayh] Concerning the Palestinian workers' movement between the autonomous region and Israel, are there any specific measures which contribute to the freedom of their movement? [Quray'] The agreed upon thing is that there will be freedom of movement for both sides' workers, and any of the two sides has the right to determine the number of these workers. [Tarabayh] Do you consider this economic agreement a basic pillar for the completion of the autonomy agreement and the establishment of a national authority? [Quray'] I believe we have made the basic and major step toward the establishment of the independent Palestinian state. [Tarabayh] Still, there are pending issues over which there are differences. In short, what are the most important of these issues? [Quray'] There are points. This is a big, complicated, and long issue. There is an occupation which will be replaced by a new national authority. Therefore, there are many pending issues. [Tarabayh] What about customs and fees? [Quray'] Many issues and problems have been solved, and policies have been drawn. These policies might be reconsidered and developed at a later time in light of experience and implementation on the ground. [Tarabayh] What about currency? [Quray'] Currency is not the main point, but one of the points. When the authority is established on the ground, our people, everywhere, will have an authority to take care of them and of their affairs, and to adopt their issues.
