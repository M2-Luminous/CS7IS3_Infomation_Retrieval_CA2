At the Boyana Residence on June 29, Mr. Aleksandrov will sign an agreement on exchange, an agreement on fiscal agency for front-loaded interest reduction bonds, an agreement on fiscal agency for collateralized discount bonds, an agreement on fiscal agency for past due interest rate bonds, and an agreement on collateral security. The documents will also be signed by officials of the closing agent, Deutsche Bank, and of the fiscal agent, Citibank. The London Club banks will also sign the agreement within one month, after which it has to be ratified by the National Assembly, Mr. Aleksandrov told reporters. The document on finalization of the deal should be signed after the ratification, and then payments will start. The agreement on exchange is the key one because it regulates an exchange of the creditor banks' receivables within the balance of debt of the Bulgarian Foreign Trade Bank for government securities or discount options, said Deputy Finance Minister Dimitur Kostov. By this agreement the state takes over the obligations arising from the issue and servicing of the respective types of bonds. The agreement is made between Bulgaria and Deutsche Bank in its capacity as closing agent on behalf of the creditors. After this agreement is signed, a document-signing procedure will start with each commercial creditor bank which has declared that it will take part in the deal. The agreements on fiscal agency for the different types of bonds define the bonds and Bulgaria's interrelations with the fiscal agent Citibank in connection with the servicing of the issues. The agreement on collateral security defines the relations between Bulgaria and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in connection with the institution and maintenance of the required security for the different types of bonds. Bulgaria owes its London Club creditors some 8,000 million U.S. dollars, Mr. Kostov recalled. In addition, this country has a 2,000-2,500 million U.S. dollars outstanding debt to the Paris Club governments and a 1,500 million U.S. dollars debt to the international financial institutions. Stoyan Aleksandrov said he had asked central bank officials to consider a strategy and take the necessary measures to prevent tensions on the currency market in connection with the finalization of the deal.
