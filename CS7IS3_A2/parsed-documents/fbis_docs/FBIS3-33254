[Begin recording] [Campos] We were returning from (?Mayapola) when, somewhere between Mayangola and Aguas Blancas, we discovered the guerrillas had set up a check point obstructing traffic. The guerrillas stopped every vehicle and encouraged support for a group called Caribbean Bloc composed of several FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] fronts. They distributed a communique protesting the presence of U.S. troops in the country; they preached to the people who were there; and, after an hour and a half, allowed traffic to begin circulating again. [Unidentified reporter] Were they aware of your presence, Mr. Mayor? [Campos] No. My presence went totally unnoticed, which was also the case with the president of the Municipal Assembly, the president of the Municipal Council, Chamber of Representatives candidate Mauro Tapia, several councilmen, and virtually the entire municipal administration. The guerrillas were there simply to promote their new Caribbean Bloc. [end recording]
