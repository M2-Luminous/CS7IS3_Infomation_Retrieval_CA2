The project was elaborated on the intiative of specialists and leaders from a number of major industrial and financial enterprises of the Central Chernozem Zone and other economic regions of Russia, and was backed by the administrations of Voronezh, Kursk, and Sverdlovsk Oblasts. Projections suggest that, already in its first stage, "Sokol" will be able to secure a growth in the volume of manufactured output from 326 billion rubles [R] last year to R1.27 trillion in 1996. The recoupment period of the investment projects will be from two to five years. "The creation of the `Sokol' Financial-Industrial Group meets the fundamental interests of federal industrial policy. This policy aims at developing the science and production complex, ensuring the competitiveness of Russian-made products, and raising economic potential," Igor Shurchkov, chairman of the State Committee for Industrial Policy, said. "We wish to use the experience of `Sokol' and of the `Uralskiye Zavody' Financial-Industrial Group which was set up earlier to prove the efficiency and promise of such groups."
