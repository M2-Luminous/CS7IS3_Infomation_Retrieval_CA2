The commission formed last year under the Vancouver accords reached by Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton in spring 1993, is co-chaired by U.S. Vice-President Albert Gore and Russian Premier Chernomyrdin who arrives in Washington on Tuesday from Milan where he attended the World Gas Congress. The commission's session promises to be quite intensive and productive. The first two sessions were held in Washington and Moscow last year. About twenty documents on bilateral cooperation in various fields are to be signed as a result of the session, Mikhail Tarasov, assistant to the Russian premier, told ITAR-TASS. There is every indication that the most important one will be a package of agreements to integrate Russia into the international programme for the development of an Alpha space station. It is expected in particular that during the session NASA and Russian Space Agency chiefs Daniel Golding and Yuriy Koptev will sign a contract worth a total of 400 million U.S. dollars for the operation of the Russian orbital station Mir during the first phase of the Alpha project. A concept, worked out by the two countries' experts, of Russian participation in creating a new-generation orbital station has already been endorsed by all other participants in the programme, including space agencies of Europe, Japan and Canada. An agreement in principle has been reached in particular to launch a Russian power module in 1997, Tarasov said. The Russian premier's assistant also spoke about the possibility that agreements will be signed to shut down reactors for the production of plutonium and cease using it for the production of nuclear weapons. However, Tarasov specified, there is no full confidence so far that such a document will be signed in the coming days because the sides still adhere to different approaches to the question of compensation for the regions where reactors subject to shutdown are located. Much interest is being generated by the forthcoming meeting between Chernomyrdin and World Bank President Lewis Preston and International Monetary Fund (IMF) managing director Michael Camdessus. It has become known from informed sources that the Russian premier's conversation with the World Bank president is expected to result in the signing of four agreements to grant credits to Russia amounting to a total about 800 million U.S. dollars. According to preliminary information, no agreements are planned to be signed during the Chernonyrdin-Camdessus meeting. However, informed sources told ITAR-TASS that the IMF chief recently spoke about the possibility of granting the IMF's so-called standard credit to Russia in the near future. It is precisely this matter that is expected to dominate the talks. On June 23, on the final day of the commission's session, a meeting between Chernomyrdin and President Bill Clinton is to take place in the White House, with the Russian premier doing his best to persuade the U.S. President into granting Russia the status of country with a transitional market economy and finally abrogating the Jackson-Vanik amendment to the trade act. The Chernomyrdin-Clinton meeting will also be an important stage of preparation for Russian President Boris Yeltsin's forthcoming visit to the United States in autumn. Apart from staying in the U.S. capital, Chernonyrdin is planning to visit Detroit, Michigan, to familiarise hinself with the operation of the General Motors technological centre on June 24 and even test one of the newest vehicle models. On the same day the Russian premier intends to attend a Russia- Sweden match at the World Cup finals.
