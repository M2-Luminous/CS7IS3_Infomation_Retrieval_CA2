Hosokawa said he will bow out after only eight months in office because personal affairs have stymied Diet business, saying it is a problem concerning "morality of politics." Hosokawa officially offered his resignation at an emergency cabinet meeting after making a surprise announcement to a hastily summoned meeting of leaders of the coalition partners, coalition officials said. He told a press conference that fresh revelations about "legally suspicious" financial dealings involving his private office prompted him to make the decision. The new revelations came to his attention Thursday night, the premier said. Hosokawa said the new allegations include receiving interest on a 100 million yen loan from Sagawa Kyubin, a scandal-tainted trucking business group, as political contributions and gaining profits from dealings using political donations. It is not yet decided when the cabinet will resign en bloc, the officials said. Hosokawa, who was swept to power last August with a vow to cleanse the nation's political scene of corruption, has come under attack over a controversial loan from Sagawa Kyubin and another financial deal related with the purchase of shares in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT). The row over the dealings has led to a stalemate in parliament, paralyzing deliberations on the budget for fiscal 1994, which started on April 1. Hosokawa's public support, which was at over 70 percent immediately after he took office, has been on a steady decline in recent weeks. Hosokawa's announcement has sent coalition leaders scrambling to find his successor and prompted some members of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to utter interest in taking part in the new cabinet. Some coalition kingpins mentioned the name of Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign minister, who heads Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. Hajime Funada, a Shinseito executive in charge of election affairs, said he favors Hata as the person to succeed Hosokawa. "It is a natural course for our party to seek Hata's premiership," Funada said. Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa also supported the idea. "I think Hata is acceptable (as the new premier)," he said. Michio Watanabe of the opposition LDP, a former foreign minister, hinted at a possible alliance with the ruling coalition. "Japan is in a crisis," he said. "We should join forces with the people that have the same idea to surmount the crisis." Koji Omi, another LDP policy-maker, said, "it is an emergency. We should establish the conditions to cope with the situation through nonpartisan efforts." Hosokawa's bombshell announcement came only two days after he strongly denied news reports that he jokingly said he wanted to quit. The unabatable corruption charges concerning the two financial deals have taken a heavy toll on his public support and undermined his already-shaky leadership in the seven-party coalition. Hosokawa reiterated that he repaid the 100 million yen loan in 1982 from Sagawa and dismissed any corruption charges over the NTT share purchase, which he has claimed was conducted by his late father-in-law. The LDP has been boycotting debate in the House of Representatives Budget Committee, demanding Diet testimony of Hosokawa's former aide over the Sagawa loan issue. Hosokawa has rejected the demand. LDP President Yohei Kono said Hosokawa's responsibility for the Diet stalemate is "heavy." Some coalition members dismissed the possibility of linking up with the LDP. Shusei Tanaka, a senior policy maker of new party Sakigake [Harbinger], said, "there is no chance that the coalition will contribute to an LDP government or lend a hand to the LDP under current conditions." The Sagawa scandal helped topple the LDP from power after nearly four decades of often corrupt rule, and paved the way for Hosokawa's alliance of conservative LDP splinter groups and traditional opposition parties like the Social Democratic Party (SDP). In pursuing his avowed goal of cleaning up Japan's political system, Hosokawa pushed through a political reform package in January that replaces multiseat districts with a combination of single-seat constituencies and proportional representation seats for the lower house. But his political standing weakened markedly after he was forced in February by strong opposition from within his own coalition to withdraw his announced plan to introduce a new value-added tax to replace the current consumption tax. Recent corruption allegations came on top of the tax fiasco and an aborted plan for a cabinet reshuffle, which widened the hiatus between Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura.
