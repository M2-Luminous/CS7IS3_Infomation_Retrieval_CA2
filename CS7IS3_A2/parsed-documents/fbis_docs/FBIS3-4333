Jiao Zhi, president of the Gold Administration under the State Metallurgical Industry Ministry, said here today that this year the country's gold production will still be directed by a state plan, and the purchasing of gold will still be monopolized by the state. He said that this year's main task for the gold trade is to put two management regulations into effect, one of which concerns introducing foreign investment, and another focusing on the use of geological prospecting foundation. The two regulations were raised before the State Council last year. Jiao also asked the gold administrative department to help the central bank to establish a standard domestic gold market and revise management rules on purchasing and selling of gold and silver. He said that this year, the gold industry should try to collect funds through multi-channels, including attracting foreign investment, in order to better develop gold resources. So far, China's gold trade has cooperative ties with more than 20 countries and regions, such as the U.S., Canada, Australia and South Africa. As Jiao disclosed, last year the amount of gold purchased by the central bank decreased by 32 percent, compared with that of the previous year. However, the country's gold production witnessed an increase of 7.5 percent. Jiao attributed the situation to the low gold-purchasing price set by the government, the emergence of original local gold markets, and a serious problem with gold smuggling. "But since the government readjusted its gold management policy in last September," Jiao noted, "The amount of gold purchased by the central bank has seen a sharp rise." For the last four months of last year, the amount of gold sold to the bank was nearly twice that for the first eight months. Jiao finally explained that last year, gold prospecting teams submitted 103 reports, which provided abundant information for gold production. In other respects, the economic benefits of the gold industry jumped 74 percent over the previous year. The gold trade yielded a huge profit of over eight hundred million yuan.
