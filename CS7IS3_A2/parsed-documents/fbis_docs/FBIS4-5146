Overflowing with invincible faith and optimism, our people, who are single-heartedly united around the party and the leader [suryong], powerfully displayed the superiority and invincible might of the popular mass-centered socialism of our own style and firmly defended the socialist cause without any vacillation during acute confrontation with the enemies by effecting an upsurge in the construction and revolution, after the conclusion of the sixth session of the ninth SPA. [applause] Our people, under the wise leadership of the party and the leader [suryong], vigorously waged the three revolutions -- ideological, technological, and cultural -- in every domain of socialist construction, holding aloft the revolutionary, socialist banner of the chuche idea. In so doing, our people brilliantly adorned the last year of the Third Seven-Year Plan by strengthening the country's political, economic, military power all the more, and triumphantly advancing the chuche socialist cause. Observing the 30th anniversary of the publication of the great agricultural thesis, our people have proudly summed up the brilliant achievements and results scored in socialist agricultural construction, and are powerfully waging the struggle for the ultimate solution of the socialist agricultural problem, holding aloft the respected and beloved leader's [suryong] historic letter to the national agricultural meeting. Our party designated the next three years as a period for adjustment based on scientific analysis of the present status of the situation today and our country's socialist economic construction, to set forth a revolutionary economic strategy in thoroughly implementing agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first policy; to give priority to the leading sectors of people's economy; and to further develop the metal industry. The economic strategy put forward by our party is a most just economic strategy of our style for renovating the nation's economic structure in compliance with the practical demands of changed international circumstances [pyonhwadoen kukjejok hwangyong] and our national economy and for effecting a change in direction [panghyang chonhwan] in foreign trade. [applause] Today we are faced with the grave and honorable tasks of more satisfactorily resolving the problems pertaining to the people's living by thoroughly implementing our party's revolutionary economic strategy in accordance with the demand of socialism and of promptly upgrading [chukhyo seuda] the nation's overall economy. Our people must fulfill tasks of the adjustment period of socialist economic construction amid fierce confrontation with the enemy. By cherishing rock-firm faith that as long as there is the wise leadership of the party and the leader [suryong] who is leading the Korean revolution along the single road of victory with ironclad will and refined leadership, we will win victory without fail, our people today are vigorously accelerating the general march to carry out the works of the adjustment period of socialist economic construction. Held during this historic time, the current SPA session will discuss issues with great significance in effecting a new great revolutionary upsurge in socialist construction and in consolidating and developing the systems of the state and society. Thus, it will greatly contribute to glorifying the socialist cause. [applause] Six hundred and fifteen of the 653 SPA deputies are in attendance at the seventh session of the ninth SPA. Therefore, the session can be convened in accordance with Article 93 of the DPRK Socialist Constitution. I firmly believe that with the active participation of all comrades deputies, the current SPA will satisfactorily discuss and decide agenda items put forward at the session. I now declare the seventh session of the ninth SPA open. [applause]
