Dr. Bukoshi told the participants at Istanbul conference that the Albanians of Kosova seek to realize their aspirations in a peaceful way, i.e., to be allowed to exert their political will in government. Such a peaceful movement is a new thing for the Balkans and, if it brings results, it can but increase the hope of the Balkan peoples for a glorious future. Prime Minister Bukoshi stressed that this would be a clear and fair signal that all the conflicts in the Balkans could be solved in a civilized way and not through the use of force. Commenting on suggestions of some people that the Albanians of Kosova accept a similar autonomy to the one that has existed in 1974, Dr. Bukoshi said that this is the same as if we ask the Albanians of Kosova to remain under the Greater Serbia and the Serbian dictatorship -- always subjugated, pursued, and agitated in every possible way and a colonial regime. Those who suggest this kind of autonomy simply give indications that they are not ready to deal with the regime of a dictator. The question of the people of Kosova is not simply a case of secessionism. The state of which it was a part has been dismantled and no country deriving from it can incorporate others within its own borders without their own will. Further on, Dr. Bukoshi said that the international community should strengthen sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, while their eventual lifting should be conditioned with the achievement of an acceptable solution for all the problems of the Yugoslav crisis, including Kosova as well. Kosova should be demilitarized and the democratic institutions be turned back to it. A kind of international protectorate should be installed in Kosova, Dr. Bukoshi underlined, stressing that Kosova should be considered by the Balkan neighboring countries as a regional problem, and not as an internal affair of Serbia, so that these countries play a more constructive role, because even their peace can be endangered. Prime Minister of the Republic of Kosova Dr. Bujar Bukoshi said that only in this way will the necessary conditions be created to participate in the negotiations on Kosova equally and without preconditions. On the contrary, the future will be uncertain and unpredictable. Closing, Dr. Bukoshi said that in the name of the Government of Kosova, we have the mandate to give life to the people's will, and we will continue to do this.
