FBIS3-43903 "drafr012_c_94012" FBIS-AFR-94-012 Document Type:Daily Report 19 Jan 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 18 Jan MB1801134994 MB1801134994 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR PAC Decision To End Armed Struggle Welcome -- The Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC) decision to end the armed struggle "is an excellent development," declares a page 12 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 18 January. "Yes, many South Africans will feel angered at Clarence Makwetu's blithe announcement, after years of disingenuously denying that the PAC had any control over its armed wing." Although the cease fire will "take some time to come into force" we "can look forward to less killing." The country can "look with some confidence towards a more inclusive election." Ultimately, the "legitimacy of the transition process has been bolstered by Makwetu's announcement." BUSINESS DAY ANC Economic Promises -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 18 January in a page 4 editorial finds the African National Congress (ANC) alliance's Reconstruction and Development Program "more specific about the promises" it is making. But, "is it specific enough about the macroeconomic context in which they will be delivered?" "It is not enough to say that 'undue inflation' and balance of payments problems should be avoided. An overheating economy, with soaring inflation and high imports, could bring the programme to a premature end. A stronger commitment is needed on macroeconomic discipline, as unpalatable as that might be politically." RAPPORT Editorial Calls for Moderate Front Against ANC -- The "Comment" column on page 14 of Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans on 16 January analyzes the ANC's election manifesto and its "so-called program of reconstruction" which it says "even frightens political appeasers of the past year. Even the most optimistic of them can no longer believe what they had earlier announced with great positiveness: That the ANC has renounced nationalization and that it had become a protagonist of a free market system with a little tinge of socialism merely for the sake of its constituency." Hopefully it will make those who applauded Mr. Mandela's so-called "assurance" more careful. It appears that as election day draws closer, and the ANC feels increasingly assured of an election victory, "the organization is bent on getting its grip on any support it can get hold of -- from education to mines, from land ownership to the civil service." "It is a good thing that the ANC's ominous future plan for totalitarian state control and interference became known just in time -- in time by all moderate people and parties involved in the present negotiations for a new dispensation." "Due to the ANC's radical socialist and racist principles, such negotiations are gaining a totally new urgent dimension. What is important right now is to stop the ANC on 27 April." "Participation must be the password to all. The basis for a broad moderate front against the ANC must be established without delay. After 27 April it will all be too late."
