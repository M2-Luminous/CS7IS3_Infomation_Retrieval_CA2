FR941222-1-00036 FR941222-1-00008 A second set of coeluting compounds consists of the three isomers 2-, 3-, and 4-aminotoluene. The presence of the three isomers was confirmed when detected, and the combined concentration of the three compounds was quantified. Because the contributions from the individual contaminants can not be established, any one of the coeluting contaminants could be present at 100 percent of the concentration detected. Therefore, the Agency evaluated coeluting compounds with health-based levels independently in the risk assessment and used the highest risk calculated by the constituents, in this case 2-aminotoluene, to ensure that risk was not underestimated. The volume of 2-aminotoluene consumed as a raw material, based on 1991 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire data, is approximately 9 times that of the other isomers. In addition, aromatic amines with substitutions in the 2- and 4- positions of the aromatic ring are used in the manufacture of azo dyes much more frequently than those substituted in the 3- position. Therefore, any impurities or breakdown products from aromatic amines are likely to be substituted in the 2- and 4- positions. 1,2-diphenylhydrazine and azobenzene also coelute on the GC/MS curve. Both compounds are likely oxidation products of aniline, and may be present in the waste as reaction by-products. In addition to the uncertainty in establishing concentrations for each of the two compounds, the chemical pathway from aniline to these oxidation products suggests that either contaminant may be present at all or part of the concentration detected. The Agency evaluated these coeluting compounds independently and used the highest risk calculated by the compounds to ensure the risk was not underestimated. As with azobenzene and 1,2-diphenylhydrazine, diphenylamine and N-nitrosodiphenylamine coelute on the GC/MS curve and are likely by-products resulting from the oxidation of aniline. As stated above, the Agency evaluated these coeluting compounds independently and used the highest risk calculated by the compounds to ensure the risk was not underestimated. The Agency requests comments on the approach used to assess risk when compounds that coelute were detected in the wastestream, and on alternative approaches that commenters may develop. 3. Risk Analysis Risk Characterization Approach The risk characterization approach follows the recent EPA Guidance on Risk Characterization (Habicht, 1992) and Guidance for Risk Assessment (EPA Risk Assessment Council, 1991). The guidance specifies that EPA risk assessments will be expected to include (1) the central tendency and high-end portions of the risk distribution, and (2) important subgroups of the populations such as highly susceptible groups or individuals, if known. In addition to the presentation of results, the guidance also specifies that the results portray a reasonable picture of the actual or projected exposures with a discussion of uncertainties. These documents are available in the public docket for this action (see ADDRESSES section). Individual Risk Individual risk descriptors are intended to convey information about the risk borne by individuals within a specified population and subpopulations. These risk descriptors are used to answer questions concerning the affected population, and the risk for individuals within a population of interest. The approach used in this analysis for characterizing baseline individual risk included: (1) Identifying and describing the population of concern for an exposure route; (2) determining the sensitivity of the model parameters used in the risk estimation; (3) estimating central tendency and high-end values for the most sensitive parameters in the risk estimation procedures; and (4) calculating individual risk for likely exposure pathways that provides a characterization of the central tendency and high-end risk descriptor. Risk Assessment The results of the risk assessment are presented in waste-specific risk tables in each of the basis for listing sections (Section II.E.). The risk tables include the following information: Constituents of concern; estimated human health risk associated with the current and plausible management scenarios; high, low, and average concentrations of constituents found in this wastestream; the number of samples in which the constituent was detected; notes regarding ``J-values'' (see Section II.B on Data Uncertainties); and industry-submitted data. In addition to those compounds presented in the waste-specific risk tables, the Agency's characterization data include a number of compounds identified as present in the waste but for which no health benchmarks exist. In addition, other compounds which do have health benchmarks have been identified in these wastes but were dropped from further consideration following the risk screening because the risks were projected to be below levels of concern. The risk tables presented in this preamble do not contain these additional constituents. The complete list of constituents found in each of the wastes generated from the manufacture of dyes and pigments, an explanation of the risk screening process, and an explanation of EPA's development of the target analyte list are presented in the Listing and Health Effects Background Documents for this proposed rule, which are located in the RCRA Docket for this rulemaking (See ADDRESSES section). The analysis of risk was developed using both the input of derived or measured toxicological information and the modeling of exposure from baseline (or current) waste management practices and other plausible management scenarios. Pursuant to the Agency's regulations on listing hazardous wastes, EPA considers the ``plausible types of improper management to which the waste could be subjected'', 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3)(vii). Thus, plausible management is one of the waste management scenarios used by EPA to assess the risks to human health and the environment from the disposal of the wastes under consideration. The choice of ``plausible management'' depends on a combination of factors which are discussed in Section II.A, ``EPA's Listing Determination Process.'' The following discussion explains the plausible management scenarios used to assess risk for each of the waste groups addressed in this proposal. The Agency requests comment on its choice of plausible management scenarios and on the possibility of using alternative plausible management scenarios.
