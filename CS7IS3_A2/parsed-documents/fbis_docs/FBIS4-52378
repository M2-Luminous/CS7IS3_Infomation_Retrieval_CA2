There is also a strong possibility of considerable progress in talks between North Korea and the United States in New York on a third round of high-level dialogue designed to improve their relations. North Korea's Deputy Ambassador to the United Nations, Kim Chong-su, refused to disclose details of the Pyongyang-Washington contact in New York on Monday. But he indicated that considerable headway was made when he said, "History always moves ahead and (we) always look at everything optimistically." Ranking diplomatic sources here said the North Korean nuclear issue could be referred back to the UN Security Council if Pyongyang and the IAEA cannot resolve the question of conducting additional inspections by this week. The U.N. Security Council, in a presidential statement, has urged Pyongyang to permit additional checks of its nuclear facilities before next week. "Since both the United States and North Korea are hoping to hold a third round of talks, there is a possibility of finding a breakthrough in their negotiations," one source said. The United States and South Korea agreed earlier to resolve the North Korean nuclear row through dialogue without having to refer it to the Security Council. Seoul and Washington have also reached an understanding that Washington will proceed to the next round of talks once North Korea shows some flexibility on IAEA inspections. Details of the U.S.-North Korean negotiations are being kept secret, but sources said Pyongyang had showed willingness to maintain the continuity of nuclear safeguards by allowing the IAEA to conduct additional inspections of a key radiochemical laboratory and change film in surveillance equipment. But North Korea refused to accept the IAEA request on collecting samples from spent fuel rods for later checks. Therefore, the two sides could be seeking a compromise on this point, the sources said. At Monday's contact in New York, the U.S. side was understood to have stressed that the Pyongyang-Washington talks could be broken off if IAEA inspectors were not present at the changing of nuclear fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon. The United States asked North Korea to delay changing the fuel rods until IAEA inspectors arrive, sources said. The Americans also pressed the IAEA to reopen negotiations with North Korea so that it can send an inspection team as soon as possible, they said. Monday's contact involved Kenneth Quinones, the State Department's North Korea desk officer, and Han Song-yol, a counsel at the North Korean Mission to the United Nations.
