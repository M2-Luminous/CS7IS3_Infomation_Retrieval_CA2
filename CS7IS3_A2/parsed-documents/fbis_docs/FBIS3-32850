FBIS3-32850 "drlat031_c_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-031 Document Type:Daily Report 15 Feb 1994 Mexico _o_OCEZ Denies Ties, Criticizes Organizers 94P20363A 94P20363A Article Type:CSO [Editorial Report] More than two months before the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) rebellion in Chiapas, the 25 October PROCESO carried a 23 September letter to the editor from the Emiliano Zapata Peasant Organization (OCEZ), denying any involvement in earlier Chiapas guerrilla activities. Such guerrilla activity had been alleged by Jesuit priest Mardonio Morales in the 13 September issue of the magazine (for this and related reports, see the 9 December FBIS LATIN AMERICA DAILY REPORT). The OCEZ letter also criticizes high-level officials who prior to beginning their government careers were involved in leftist political activities in Chiapas during the 1970's. The letter asserts that since its formation in 1982 the OCEZ has operated entirely within the law in its struggle for land and in its organizing activities throughout Chiapas. It also acknowledges that the group that eventually became the OCEZ had had political ties with a Maoist group, the Popular Line (which later became the Proletarian Line), or so-called "northerners," during the period March-August 1978. The letter concedes that "we dealt with Adolfo Orive, Javier Gil, and another two dozen `cadres' who came to Chiapas to develop `support bases'" but claims that in the course of our dealings "we discovered serious contradictions between their radical phraseology and their actual behavior, most notably: their great waste of economic resources, their unusual links with public officials, a so-called `two-faced policy,' a disguised pro-government approach, manipulation and immorality--all of which clashed with our viewpoints and principles and prompted us to break relations with them." In addition, the letter denies that the OCEZ ever sought to penetrate the Church to increase its influence, as charged by Father Mardonio. The letter's criticism of the northern organizers' integrity touches on an issue already raised in the press: the government's reported efforts to recruit leftists for government service. The 13 September PROCESO report itself, for instance, asserts that while Orive had been a professor in the School of Economics at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, where he founded the Popular Line and Proletarian Line groups, he has since gone on to serve as current training director of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)-affiliated National Peasant Confederation (CNC) and as a director of the National Solidarity Program (Pronasol) as well as adviser to Pronasol Coordinator Carlos Rojas Gutierrez. The letter also implicitly criticizes former Popular Line leader Hugo Andres Araujo de la Torre, who is identified as a PRI federal deputy and CNC secretary general by Father Mardonio in the 13 September PROCESO report. A 7 September 1992 PROCESO article on political recruitment had described the careers of Orive (written there as "Oribe," but clearly referring to the same person) and Araujo, adding that the latter "had passed through almost the entire gamut of organizations on the left, ranging from radical Maoists to the...Popular Action Movement." A 9 December 1991 PROCESO article had identified Araujo as sharing a "compadre," or godparent, relationship with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
