FR940207-2-00141 FR940207-2-00070 [Release No. 34&hyph;33553; International Series Release No. 632; File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;93&hyph;54] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving, and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Amendment No. 1 to, a Proposed Rule Change Relating to the Listing of Options on American Depositary Receipts January 31, 1994. I. Introduction On November 15, 1993, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or SEC''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to provide for the listing and trading of options on American Depositary Receipts (``ADRs'') where 50% or more of the world-wide trading volume of the underlying foreign security occurs in the U.S. ADR market. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33252 (November 26, 1993), 58 FR 63604 (December 2, 1993). No comments were received on the proposed rule change. 3 3 The proposal was amended on January 5, 1994 to clarify the procedure the Phlx would use to determine whether 50% or more of the world-wide trading volume of the underlying foreign security occurs in the U.S. ADR market. Letter from Michele R. Weisbaum, Associate General Counsel, Phlx, to Monica C. Michelizzi, Staff Attorney, Office of Derivatives Regulation, Division of Market Regulation (``Division''), Commission, dated January 5, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1``). II. Description On November 27, 1992, the Commission approved a Phlx proposal to list and trade ADR options where the underlying foreign security is subject to a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement and the underlying ADR meets or exceeds the Exchange's established uniform options listing standards. 4 First, the ADR Approval Order provides that for ADR options to be eligible for listing and continued trading, the Phlx must have comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements in place with the foreign exchanges that serve as the primary markets for the foreign securities underlying the ADRs, unless the Commission otherwise approves the options' listing without an agreement. Second, the Phlx's initial listing standards require that the ADRs underlying the Exchange-listed options have a ``float'' of 7,000,000 ADRs outstanding, 2,000 shareholders, trading volume of at least 2,400,000 over the prior twelve month period, and a minimum price of $71/2 for a majority of the business days during the preceding three month period. Moreover, options on ADRs must meet or exceed the maintenance criteria for continued listing under the Phlx rules. Those criteria require that the ADRs underlying Exchange-listed options maintain a ``float'' of 6,300,000 ADRs, 1,600 shareholders, trading volume of at least 1,800,000 over the prior twelve month period, and a minimum price of $5 on a majority of the business days during the preceding six month period. Additionally, the ADR Approval Order requires the Phlx to make reasonable inquiry to evaluate the securities underlying the ADRs to ensure that these securities are generally consistent with the above-noted listing requirements. 4 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31532 (November 27, 1992), 57 FR 57264 (December 3, 1992) (``ADR Approval Order''). A comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement provides, among other things, for the exchange of market trading activity, clearing activity, and the identity of the ultimate purchaser or seller of the securities traded. Furthermore, the Phlx options initial listing standards require that the ADR underlying an ADR option be registered and listed on a national securities exchange or traded through the facilities of a national securities association and be reported as a national market system security. The issuers of the ADRs also must be in compliance with any other applicable requirements of the Act. The current proposal would authorize the Phlx to list and trade options on ADRs where 50% or more of the world-wide trading volume in the underlying foreign security occurs in the U.S. ADR market. The proposal also provides that the percentage of the world-wide trading volume that occurs in the U.S. ADR market meet a maintenance standard of 30% for the ADR options to continue to be trading on the Exchange. Under the proposal, if the ADR options meet the above-noted criteria, the options may be listed without the existence of a surveillance sharing agreement between the Phlx and the primary exchange on which the foreign securities underlying the ADRs trade. 5 5 Under the proposal, should the ADR option not meet this numerical standard, the Exchange could not list the ADR option unless there is a surveillance sharing agreement between the Exchange and the primary exchange on which the foreign securities underlying the ADRs trade or the Commission specifically authorized the listing. The Commission would give such authorization in the context of approving a rule filing submitted under section 19 of the Act and Rule 19b&hyph;4, thereunder.
