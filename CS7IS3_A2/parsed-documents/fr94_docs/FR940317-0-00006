FR940317-0-00006 FR940317-0-00002 The assessment rates recommended by the Committee are derived by dividing the anticipated expenses by expected shipments of pears. Because these rates are applied to actual shipments, they must be established at rates which will provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's expected expenses. The Winter Pear Control Committee met on June 4, and June 24, 1993, and unanimously recommended total expenses of $6,933,615 for the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year. In comparison, the 1992&hyph;93 fiscal year expense amount was $6,716,983, which is $216,632 less than the recommended amount for this fiscal year. The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.45 per standard box, or equivalent and a supplemental assessment rate of $0.04 per standard box, or equivalent for Anjou variety pears. In comparison, the 1992&hyph;93 pear assessment rate was $0.43 per standard box, or equivalent and $0.09 for the supplemental assessment rate on Anjou variety pears. This represents a $0.02 increase and $0.05 decrease, respectively, in the assessment rates recommended for this fiscal year because the current rates should generate sufficient income to cover the increased expenses. Major expense categories for the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year include $4,937,803 for advertising, $566,433 for contingency, $422,826 for Ethoxyquin data research, and $174,775 for salaries and benefits. Comparable 1992&hyph;93 budgeted expenses are $4,562,500, $490,578, $855,000, and $160,905, respectively. The Committee's approved 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year expenses and assessment rates were adopted in a final rule and published in the Federal Register (58 FR 54926, October 25, 1993). On December 1, 1993, the Committee conducted a mail ballot and on a vote of 13 in favor and 1 opposed, recommended to increase expenses to $7,931,925. This is a $998,310 increase in expenses from the previously approved 1993&hyph;94 budget. No changes in the approved assessment rates were recommended because the current rates should generate sufficient income to cover the increased expenses. The increase is deemed necessary by the Committee because the crop estimate, which is now approximated at 15,250,000 standard boxes of winter pears was underestimated by nearly 2 million boxes. Due to the larger crop, additional funding in major categories is needed. This includes a total of $639,322 for contingency, $5,718,750 for paid advertising, $305,000 for winter pear improvement, $305,000 for SOPP, and $484,000 for Ethoxyquin data research which represent increases of $72,889, $780,947, $41,650; $41,650, and $61,174 respectively, from the previously approved budget.
