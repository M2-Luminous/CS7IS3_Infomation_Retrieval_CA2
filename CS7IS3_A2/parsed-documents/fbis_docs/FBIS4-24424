It is different now. We can get some idea of this by viewing Shanghai's use of foreign capital. The strategic policy known as "one head, three centers" (aimed at building Shanghai into one of the world's economic, banking, and trade centers by relying on the development of the Pudong New District as the head or driving force) is bringing about earth- shaking changes in Shanghai. The Shanghai people have stood up, they have widened their horizon, and naturally they have demonstrated their skills and become much wiser. "Optimization" and "Stressing Eugenics" On the matter of utilizing foreign capital, whether to recklessly go after quotas and quantity and to integrate "quantity" with "quality" or to pay more attention to quality -- this is a problem that has not been satisfactorily solved until now. The practice of seeking quick results, rushing headlong into mass action, and never rejecting offers is very common today. As a result, "what has been picked up and placed into the basket" was not necessarily a "vegetable." What is astute and wise about Shanghai is that its people pay attention to efficiency. The rate of success in forming joint ventures was high, and the economic results were good. Among the nearly 4,000 foreign-funded enterprises in Shanghai, more than 80 percent are making profits. Last year, their exports were worth $1.61 billion, accounting for 22 percent of the municipality's total export volume. Last year, the (Hezhong Kaili) Air Conditioning Equipment Company's per-capita profit (after tax) was 50 yuan, making it an outstanding enterprise. The joint venture partner is the transnational (Kaili) Corporation of the United States, which has been known as "the father of central air conditioning." Its American deputy director boasted that the joint venture is the most successful enterprise the corporation has invested. The Shanghai Caohejing New Technology Development Zone has paid attention to the size of investment projects. More than 120 foreign-funded enterprises have been established in this zone, with the rate of success reaching 95 percent. It has developed into an industrial park with microelectronics as the forerunner, followed by industries employing new technologies, such as computers, optical fiber communications, biological engineering, new materials, electronic parts and elements, industrial automation instruments and meters, and the space and aviation industry. A large number of well-known transnational corporations have established plants in the zone, and 16 of them were investment projects with more than $10 million each. Last year, 82 foreign-funded enterprises went into production. Their per-capita income was 340,000 yuan; per-capita tax and profit, 77,000 yuan; and per-capita foreign exchange earnings, 26,500 yuan. In this zone, the Shanghai (Fukesibolo) Company, a Sino-U.S. joint venture, manufactures industrial "brains" -- instruments, meters, and systems for controlling and managing industrial processes. Its automation control systems have been used by the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant. The company made profits in its second year after going into production, with profits surging to a peak in 1991. Between 1991-1993, the foreign joint venture partner made more than $4 million. A boss of the foreign joint venture's mother company said jokingly, when he met general manager Wang Zhenfeng in Singapore: "Hey, we are millionaires!" In Shanghai, veteran experts said that selecting the correct investment project is very important, adding, to select the right investment project, it is better to have less than too many. In using foreign capital, it is necessary to pay attention to "optimization" and "eugenics." This is because if a problem occurs in the fetus of the mother, economic efficiency is out of the question. They said: Foreign businessmen have come to make money, but we have to choose the moneymaker who will benefit China. This is called mutual benefit. To accept offers uncritically is not wise. A responsible person of the State Council Special Economic Zone Affairs Office in charge of foreign investments said: In using foreign capital, we should take the initiative and avoid being passive. We should not accept all offers. Instead, we should strive for projects that we need. Many economically efficient joint ventures in Shanghai constantly import advanced technologies; some even set such a condition in the joint venture contracts. This is a wise policy. A one-time deal with respect to importing technology is not to our advantage, let alone importing what is abandoned by others. Modern science and technology are subject to fast updating. To make our enterprises economically efficient and win in competition, we must not overlook the dynamic import of technology. What do we mean by dynamic import? It means that the imported technology should be like a river with constantly running water: After an imported project is put into operation, it continues to receive updated versions of the technology from its foreign provider. In this way, the product will be maintained at an advanced technological level and have competitive power in the international market for a long time. The automatic control system at Shanghai's Baoshan Iron and Steel Corporation is a new product just developed in the United States and supplied by a Sino-American joint venture in Shanghai -- the (Foxboro) Company. How could the company obtain the product so fast? It is because the company has a constant supply of the latest American technologies. According to the company, to import a product dynamically is like eating, and you should chew one in your mouth, hold another in your hand, and set eyes on a third; otherwise, the imported product will be unpopular and even lose its market. The Sino-German Shanghai Volkswagen Corporation [SVWC] imported the technology for the Santana sedan. According to the contract, the German partner is obligated to help the corporation develop new car models. With the constant increase in the proportion of parts produced by our country, for the first time, our sedan industry has the ability to follow advanced foreign technology and to develop new car models. Now, SVWC has begun to develop a new model. So far, the SVWC has produced more than 200,000 sedans which sell very well. It plans to produce 200,000 cars this year. When the new model is developed, SVWC will become even stronger. The strong win and the weak fail. Old products and technology inevitably have no competitive market power. When using foreign capital, and particularly when using it in running high-technology industries, it is necessary to regard dynamic import as an important part of the cooperation. Enlightenment From the Investment by Transnational Companies The comrades in Shanghai told me that 27 of the world's top 100 transnational industrial companies have come to invest in Shanghai, and others are discussing investment projects with us. In the New Pudong District, 30 joint ventures, cooperative enterprises, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises have investment from transnational companies. Large transnational companies, with combined functions of investment, trading, and banking, is the major form of modern production in the present world. They have more and more become the principal part of the world's economic activities. In cooperation with them, we can benefit from their large-scale and systematic operation. The United Nations has rated the Shanghai Bell Telephone Equipment Manufacturing Company, a famous Sino-Belgian joint venture, as one of the top 10 best joint ventures for the fourth consecutive time. All its 1994 products have been pre-sold. (Mauriel), an old member of the board of directors on the Belgian side, arrived in Shanghai in April; it was his 100th visit to China. Well-known in Belgium for being a representative of the Sino-Belgian joint venture "Shanghai Bell" founded 11 years ago, he is frequently invited to give lectures here and there, and he takes pride in his role. Since "Shanghai Bell" tided over some difficulties in the initial stage, its major product, the Sino-Belgian digital program-controlled telephone exchange system (of the world's technological level of the late eighties), has been selected by the state as an exceptional piece of equipment and rated a universal product up to (ARCAT) [a er ka te 7093 1422 0595 3676] international standards. The product can compete with its counterparts produced by other companies in the world in terms of both quality and price. Shanghai Bell's products account for more than one third of all program-controlled telephone exchanges currently used in China, and the users of the company's products are all over China. Shanghai Bell has exported complete sets of hardware and software. It is buying land in Pudong for the construction of a larger and technologically more advanced production base. It is very necessary to attract more powerful consortiums and transnational companies to cooperate with us. It is because they are capable of working on high-technology, new-technology, and large-scale projects, as well as capital-, technology-, and knowledge-intensive projects. They are more dependable in terms of capital funds and they can play a remarkable demonstration role. Of Shanghai's economically efficient large and medium backbone enterprises, the top five with the highest per-worker profit earnings are enterprises funded with transnational investment. Cooperation with transnational companies meets our needs in terms of substitutes for imports, industrial policy, and industrial structure. Transnational companies invest in a wide range of areas, including banking, trading, guesthouses, real estate, and infrastructure. One bird can attract 100 more birds; so, a large transnational company's investment usually inspires other relevant companies and trades to invest in China. Transnational companies are law-abiding, more trustworthy in contract fulfillment, and work according to international practices. Our use of foreign capital is progressing from lower to higher levels, and from the labor-intensive stage to the technology- and knowledge-intensive stage. So far, China has approved the establishment of over 180,000 joint ventures, cooperative enterprises, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises. The absolute figures show that only a small number are large projects, but the large projects involve a large sum of investment. In Shanghai, there are 472 enterprises each funded with an investment of over $10 million. They account for only 6 percent of the total number of foreign-funded enterprises, but their investment accounts for 65 percent of the total investment. In addition, all of them are advanced-type enterprises. In the use of foreign capital during the initial stage of opening up, we paid more attention to importing single items. With the change in the situation, we need more systematic imports because a system's force is greater than the combined total of several single items. According to a Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Ministry International Economic Cooperation Institute researcher, who is well-versed in transnational companies, the characteristics of transnational companies are systematic operation and investment by combining industry with science and trade and by involving more than one industry and one trade. Transnational investments have enlightened us. Calculating "Grade Differences" Some say we should not be content with using foreign capital on small-scale projects, while others call for concrete analyses to replace the "sparrow warfare" and "guerrilla warfare" tactics. For regions that have made some headway in inducing foreign capital, it is correct not to rest content with small-scale foreign-funded projects. However, as regions have developed unevenly, most transnational corporations have invested in major coastal cities and other regions with better infrastructure. For a greater number of regions, should they carry out small, medium, or large foreign- funded projects? Even major cities do not use foreign capital entirely on large projects. Therefore, we should not neglect the use of foreign capital on small and medium projects, which should be carried out selectively and on the condition of mutual benefit. Foreign capital must not be induced to our disadvantage and, much more, to the detriment of our spiritual civilization. As far as foreign capital use is concerned, the issue of phased transfer and technological "grade differences" merits our thought. Special economic zones and major cities are golden regions, where we should concentrate on high-grade projects in line with the investment trend and conducive to the readjustment of production structure; primary and labor-intensive and semifinished products manufacturing projects should be transferred to other regions. We should do some economic calculations of the "grade differences." Shanghai Bell Vice President Li Dalai remarked: "We do not want to promote small and comprehensive projects, but will concentrate on software. Some domestic enterprises have their machine tools lying idle. We intend to reinvigorate them by moving them to other regions. We may even set up some research institutes in the hinterland, with headquarters in the coastal region and the same wages and living conditions as those of the coastal region. The environment there [the hinterland] is peace and quiet and good for doing research." His remarks reflect the demand for the coastal region to move out to and bring along the hinterland as well as for foreign-funded enterprises to raise their rate of domestic production. It is time for special economic zones and some major coastal cities to transfer step-by-step labor-intensive enterprises to other regions and to increase the value of golden regions themselves by increasing contacts with leading and transnational corporations having high-grade technologies and substantial strength. China vis-a-vis the world and vice versa shows that the changing global economic structure has provided us with many development opportunities. We should adopt a strategic vision and improve the work of using foreign capital with astute and wise thought.
