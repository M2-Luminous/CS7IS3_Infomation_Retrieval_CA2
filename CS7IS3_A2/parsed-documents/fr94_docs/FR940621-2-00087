FR940621-2-00087 FR940621-2-00053 Accordingly, after consideration of the entire exemption record, including the written comments, the Department has determined to grant the replacement exemption as modified herein. General Information The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: (1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person from certain other provisions of the Act and the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act, which require, among other things, a fiduciary to discharge his or her duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of the Act; nor does it affect the requirements of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries; (2) In accordance with section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, the Department has found that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interest of the Plans and their participants and beneficiaries and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of the Plans; and (3) The exemption is supplemental to, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of the Act and the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions. Furthermore, the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction. (4) In addition to transactions involving the GIC Fund, the exemption is applicable to the transactions previously described in PTE 92&hyph;77 only if the conditions specified therein are met. Exemption Under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and in accordance with the Procedures cited above, the Department hereby replaces PTE 92&hyph;77 as follows: Section I. Covered Transactions (a) The restrictions of section 406(a) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (D) of the Code, shall not apply to the purchase or redemption of shares by Plans in the SBI-established Trust in connection with such Plans' participation in the TRAK Personalized Investment Advisory Service. (b) The restrictions of section 406(b) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (E) and (F) of the Code, shall not apply to the provision, by the Consulting Group, of investment advisory services to an Independent Plan Fiduciary of a participating Plan which may result in such fiduciary's selection of a Portfolio in the TRAK Program for the investment of Plan assets. The exemption is subject to the following conditions that are set forth in Section II. Section II. General Conditions (a) The participation of Plans in the TRAK Program will be approved by an Independent Plan Fiduciary.
