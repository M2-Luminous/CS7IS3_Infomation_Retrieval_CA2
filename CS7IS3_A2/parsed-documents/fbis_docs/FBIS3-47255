These and other policies are contained in a New Year report to Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Kim Yang-pae, made by Kim Kwang-hui, administrator of the Rural Development Administration (RDA) yesterday [10 January]. The RDA administrator said that agriculture-related research would be centered on how to strengthen competitiveness of farming products, a departure from the traditional emphasis on how to increase farming yield. To do so, he said, the administration plans to expand the ratio of R&D funds for the farming sector to the nation's total agricultural production from this year's 0.42 percent or 73.3 billion won to 0.88 percent or 175.9 billion won in 1998. He also reported that production costs of rice per kilogram would be reduced from the current 862 won to 441 won by 2001, while rice yield per 10 acres would rise from the present 461kg to 510kg by 2001. Production costs of beef per kilogram would decline from the current 5,152 won to 3,723 won in seven years, he said. The administration plans to drop production costs of barley by 52.7 percent from the present 417 won per kilogram to 197 won by 2001 and those of beans and potatoes by 48.6 percent and 63.7 percent from the present 1,078 won to 554 won and from the current 342 won to 124 won, respectively. It also plans to reduce production costs of pork per kilogram from the current 1,294 won to 924 won by 2001 and those of red pepper from the current 3,578 won per kilogram to 1,800 won by 2001. The RDA also will put priority on the development of environment-friendly farming technologies while expanding trial farming-products specialization projects by region.
