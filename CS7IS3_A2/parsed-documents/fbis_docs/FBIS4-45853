The Environment Ministry (ENV) on Wednesday called for extra public vigilance as the number of houses found breeding the dengue-spreading Aedes mosquito doubled from 372 in February to 728 last month. To date, a total of 260 cases of dengue fever have been reported this year, with no deaths recorded so far. In the last four weeks alone, 57 cases were reported, compared with 12 for the same period last year. An Environment Ministry spokesman said that the number of breedings indoors in water-bearing containers such as pails, jars, basins, tanks, vases and flower-pot plates had nearly tripled over the last month. Outdoor checks had similar findings, he added. Most of the breedings were found in unwanted water-bearing receptacles, gully traps, canvas or plastic sheets, and drains. [Passage omitted] Another mosquito-borne threat, malaria, has also been on the rise, with 81 cases having been reported since the start of the year, compared with 50 cases for the same period last year. All, except five, of this year's cases were contracted overseas. The Environment Ministry reports that the incidence of imported malaria among foreign workers has been increasing. In 1989, there were 25 cases. Last year's figure was 116. [Passage omitted]
