Basindwah, who toured the MBC Television building in London today, said that Aden refused to hold a dialogue within the framework of Yemeni unity. Basindwah told our colleague Hasan Zaytuni that Sanaa refuses to make any concessions to end the crisis. [Begin recording] [Basindwah] First of all, I would like to say that the failure of political efforts so far is the fault of the separatist rebels. We agreed to talk to a delegation representing them within the framework of the Republic of Yemen, but they insisted on conducting the talks as representatives of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, which is so far unrecognized by any country. We cannot recognize the existence of any state on Yemeni soil, other than the Republic of Yemen. [Zaytuni] Should we conclude from this that Sanaa is not ready to hold a dialogue in the framework of, say, a confederation or federation between the south and north? [Basindwah] No one has the right to impose on our people any form of unity other than the merger formula agreed upon since the unification of the country. I am puzzled by those who refuse to understand that constitutional legitimacy does not permit anyone to impose a formula for unity other than the existing one. [end recording] [passage omitted] For his part, 'Abdallah al-Asnaj, the foreign minister of the government declared in south Yemen, has said that the visit to Washington by southern Yemeni officials is designed to brief U.S. and UN officials on the latest developments in the Yemeni crisis. Speaking to us by telephone, al-Asnaj blamed Sanaa for the continued fighting, referring to what he said was Sanaa's procrastination in implementing the cease-fire. [Begin al-Asnaj recording] The visit [to the United States] by Prime Minister Haydar al-'Attas and myself is aimed at ensuring that the UN Security Council and UN member countries are briefed on the true situation in Yemen. We hope to initiate efforts leading to an end to the fighting in Yemen. No region is more vital and strategic to international community than that of the Arab peninsula and the Gulf. The UN Security Council will decide on a course of action. We in the Democratic Republic of Yemen simply want to give a true picture of the situation, the perils involved, and the external forces encouraging the Sanaa regime to keep the war going and to destroy south Yemeni towns, villages, and institutions.
