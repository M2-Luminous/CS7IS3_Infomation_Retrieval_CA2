During this meeting, which was held in the Mohamed Laid al-Khalifa Cultural Center, the interior minister delivered an address devoted to security issues and the means and facilities the state has made available and continues to provide in order to eliminate the phenomenon of armed violence aimed at the citizens, security men, and state institutions. Abdelwahab Zeid, from the Constantine radio station, gives us the most important points of the interior minister's address: [Zeid] Mr. Saadi stressed the fresh measures taken at all levels and designed to ensure that we stand as one, facing up with determination and firmness to all maneuvers aimed at Algeria, its people, and its government. He underlined the need for citizens to mobilize, each in his own position, to defend the gains of the liberation revolution [of 1954] and the state institutions which belong to the people, and the future of its sons and coming generations. [Begin Saadi recording] From the experiences of the last year or two in fighting this disaster we have drawn lessons on the need to review the fight against this phenomenon, either by way of renewing our methods of fighting or changing our ways of using these methods. Such a review makes us aware that we will be entering a new era of mobilizing more material and human resources and improving the methods of our fight to make them more effective. We have started this process, and you are going to see it on the ground in the future. However, the problems of security and the fight against terrorism should not remain solely the task of the security men. The security men are now in the service of the people, and the people should therefore increase their participation in helping the security men. We know that there are conditions that must be available, for example, (?legal) conditions. We are going to make these conditions available, because we are going to ensure the presence of the minimum necessary force in every municipality, everywhere, to secure a general cover [applause interrupting]. Let us now speak about another subject, through which we are going to give our reply to those in charge of public enterprises. We have taken measures to ensure that these enterprises, which belong to the people, are protected by their own workers. This means people will be appointed to assume this task. If we are sometimes unable to find people with the necessary qualities from within the enterprises, then people will be recruited from outside the enterprise to provide the necessary protection for the enterprise and its assets. But we cannot leave these enterprises open to sabotage. [end recording]
