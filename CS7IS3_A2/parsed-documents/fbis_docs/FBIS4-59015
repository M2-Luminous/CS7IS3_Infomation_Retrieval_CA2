The minister disclosed that the cost of the initial security arrangements will stand at approximately 30 million shekels, in addition to an annual outlay of 20 million shekels. As an example, he cited the need to build a security system, including a 7-km road to one of the settlements. "We are doing it to keep the agreement from collapsing," the minister noted. "The opponents of the agreement with the PLO are trying to scare and unnerve the residents of areas through which Arabs will drive," Peres said at a ceremony to mark the laying of the cornerstone for a new 'Amal technological college near Ashqelon. "It all depends on relationships, not security," the minister stressed. "There is no fence between Elat and al-'Aqabah, and relations there are excellent. Arabs live in Yafo, too. A new relationship must be created." Peres denied rumors spread two days ago that Israel is not going to continue the talks with the PLO on the issues that remained unresolved when the Cairo agreement was signed. "Israel will adhere to its commitments," Peres stressed. With regard to foreign labor hired by Qatif farmers, the minister said it is preferable to employ Israeli laborers in agriculture.
