In series 1, nine rats received 0.3-ml IP injections. The animals in group 1 received haloperidol in a dose of 2 mg/kg, and those in the control group were injected with a physiological solution. In series 2, 10 rats were injected with haloperidol bilaterally into the rostral region of the neostriatum through cannulas that had been implanted in them while they were anesthetized. The cannulas implanted into the group 1 animals were filled with a 5 percent haloperidol solution sufficient for several dozens of injections, whereas the cannulas implanted in the group 2 animals were filled with a physiological solution. Each injection had a volume of 1 �l (5 �g haloperidol). The microinjections were begun 3 days after the implantation operations and were continued daily for 3 weeks. The rats were tested for catalepsy 10 and then 30 minutes after each injection, and their spontaneous motor activity was evaluated between 20 and 25 minutes after injection. The 3-week course of daily microinjections of 5 �g of haloperidol into the rats' neostriatum induced a set of Parkinsonism-like symptoms in the form of rigidity and akinesia but not in catalepsy. IP injection of haloperidol, on the other hand, resulted in inhibition of conditioned avoidance reflexes and in catalepsy. The effects of haloperidol began to appear on day 7 of the experiment, gradually increased, and persisted until several days after the haloperidol was discontinued. The toxic effects of haloperidol that are inevitable when the drug is administered systemically for a prolonged period were completely absent in the mice studied. Instead, the effects of the haloperidol proved reversible and remained localized. Like other researchers, the authors of this study were unable to achieve parkinsonian syndrome in rats by system injection of haloperidol. They attributed this fact to specific differences between mice and humans and emphasized the fact that chronic injection of haloperidol into the striatum did not result in catalepsy, which appears to contradict thinking regarding the involvement of the striatum and its dopaminergic system in the pathogenesis of cataleptic rigidity. The authors explained this phenomenon by stating that local injection results in different pharmacologic loads that do not trigger catalepsy but that instead induce akinesia similar to parkinsonian akinesia. They further stated that consideration must be given to the fact that in the case of systemic injection, neuroleptics exert a mediated effect on the central nervous system through somatic systems (for example, because of a change in the content of metals in blood plasma, which in turn results in a whole set of biochemical disorders).
