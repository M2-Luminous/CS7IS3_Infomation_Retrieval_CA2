This is shown by files of the Latvian Public Prosecutor's Office, to which the Riga daily DIENA was able to gain access. According to latest findings by the Stuttgart Land Office of Criminal Investigations, in addition to pilot Rudolf Wirschen and the two Czechs, Iveta Ranetova and Alena Petrusova, Berlin building entrepreneur Josef Rimmele and his partner Klaus Eichler were aboard the plane. The latter two tried to make a deal with allegedly radioactive materials in the Latvian capital of Riga last autumn. Murky Water, Murky Figures According to the files of the Latvian investigators, Rimmele and Eichler were high-ranking former employees of the GDR [German Democratic Republic] State Security Service; another wire puller of the deal and mediator of murky business contacts in the east, Klaus-Peter Nedwig, served as a lieutenant colonel in the GDR People's Police in the past. The interpreter for the Germans was Pawel Minarchik, formerly captain of the Czechoslovak intelligence service, who had infiltrated Radio Free Europe as an employee during the years of the Cold War and was later sentenced to a prison term for trying to blow up the radio station. According to the files of the Riga Public Prosecutor's Office, in spring 1993 Rimmele and Eichler met in Prague with Alexander Korisno, the owner of the Marketing Service company, which is registered in Latvia. Already at that time, they spoke of a deal with "rare metals." On 24 October 1993, Rimmele, Eichler, Ranetova, Petrusova, as well as Minarchik arrived in Riga. There, in the office of the Dimassko company in Valdemara Street 161, the men met with the so-far unknown sellers of 66 kg of rubidium and 6 kg cesium 133 (both metals are not radioactive). According to findings by the Latvian public prosecutor's office, at that time the goods were in the bonded warehouse at Zurich Kloten airport at the disposal of a company owned by Rimmele. The purpose of the trip to Riga reportedly was to settle payment modalities -- $2 million in cash were demanded. However, the fact that the two buyers had not yet found a customer for the allegedly "hot goods" and thus were not able to pay seems to have met with little understanding by the sellers, according to the files of the Latvian investigators. In the Hands of the Mafia The further course of the events reportedly was as follows: When Rimmele, Eichler, and Minarchik left the office, they were attacked in front of the door by six to eight masked men, who pushed them into a small bus, threatening to use their weapons. The bus took them to a hiding place in a private building in Saremas Street 8. There the kidnappers demanded money. The above-mentioned address is well known to the local police: The building used to belong to Viktors Balulis, a gangster with a long police record, who had fled from the authorities and gone abroad. According to the findings by the Latvian investigators, Rimmele and Minarchik were released soon afterwards, while Eichler--tied with hand-cuffs to a heater -- remained in the basement of the building in Saremas Street. Minarchik and the two women were emphatically told not to leave Riga, while Rimmele flew back to Germany -- probably to get money. On 27 October, he turned to the German Embassy in Riga, reporting that Eichler had been kidnapped the day before. However, Latvian Interior Minister Kristovskis was told by the Embassy about this matter as late as on 3 November. Goods From Moscow When Rimmele returned to Riga on 10 November, Korisno, the above- mentioned owner of the Marketing Service company, demanded not only $2.2 million as payment for the goods, but another $17,000 for himself as a bonus. On the same day he was arrested by the police. During the subsequent interrogation, Korisno admitted to talks with Rimmele and Eichler about the purchase of "rare metals" and to several meetings with the two in Riga, but he claimed that he did not now where Eichler was. On 20 November, Eichler managed to flee despite the fact that he was constantly watched. He immediately reported to the police and told them about the background of the kidnapping. According to the current findings of the Riga Public Prosecutor's Office, the "rare metals" probably reached Switzerland from Latvia without any detours; only the juridical and financial part of the transaction took place in the Baltic republic. Clues point to a scientific production facility in Moscow as the actual seller. So far, the Latvian public prosecutor has issued indictments against five persons only for kidnapping.
