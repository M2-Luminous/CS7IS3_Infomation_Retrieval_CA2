The relevant department has already tuned down its propaganda on economic development this year, and this kind of change has once again led to disagreements between the central and local authorities. According to an authoritative and informed source in Beijing, since New Year's Day, the development principle publicized by the CPC has already been changed from the "six-character principle" of "sustained, rapid, and healthy [chixu, kuaisu, jiankang, 2170 4958, 1816 6643, 0256 1660]" development at the end of last year, to the amended "16-character principle" of "grasping opportunity, deepening reform, promoting development, and maintaining stability [zhuazhu jiyu, shenhua gaige, cujin fazhan, baochi wending, 2119 0145 2623 6657, 3234 0553 2395 7245, 0191 6651 4099 1455, 0202 2170 4489 1353]." According to information, the "16-character principle" is thorough and encompassing. It talks about reform on the one hand, and development on the other, and it talks about opportunity on the one hand, and stability on the other. Compared with the "six- character principle," it is thorough and concrete, more mature, less biased, and less extreme. The "six-character principle" emphasizes "rapid" development which is realized by "healthy" development. The 16-character instruction stresses "reform" and is eventually to be realized by the two characters of "stability," and its implication is clear without explanation. The central leadership's rationale is that reform needs a relaxed environment, and that if the strings of economic operations are overstretched, this is not helpful to deepening reform. Reform has to be promoted, a certain development speed has to be maintained, inflation has to be checked, and social stability has to be maintained. The question of how to adjust relations among these four things is certainly a major topic . Jiang Zemin's speech to the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, carried by newspapers in Beijing yesterday, once again talked about "properly handling the relations between reform and development." In his speech he said that it is necessary to create a more relaxed environment for reform, and that the old ways of extensive operations, which is characterized by the blind pursuit of output value and expansion of the scale of investment, cannot be followed again. In his New Year speech, Premier Li Peng lowered the development speed target to 8-9 percent, and repeatedly stressed the importance of stability; this in fact fixed the tone for "cooling down the temperature" this year. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji has talked about the economic situation on many occasions and has always reminded local officials "not to act too hastily," not to compare speed, and not to blindly make investments and randomly launch projects. He has always been critical of the "craze for development zones" and "craze for real estate," and he does not agree with the "extraordinary" and "high- speed" proposals. Li Lanqing, another vice premier, said recently when inspecting Zhejiang and Shanghai: "A new series of important reform measures will be announced this year, and we must pay special attention to maintaining social stability, check the upsurge of prices, and control the scale of investment in fixed assets to reduce risks and create a good external environment for expediting reform. The inflation problem must receive special attention." On 16 January, the government's RENMIN RIBAO carried on the front page with a major headline a commentator's article, entitled: "Prevent Blind Development of Real Estate." The article criticized some localities, departments, and units who are presently authorizing projects unduly without observing the relevant state regulations, and some even acted in their own ways and blindly launched projects: "the craze for real estate has reemerged." It is alleged that the spirit of the article came mainly from Zhongnanhai. However, what is clearly opposite to the attitude of the central leadership is that local officials have never ceased calling for "vigorous work and rapid growth." Shanghai leaders have said on many occasions that to Shanghai, low-speed development equates to no development and that Shanghai must grasp the opportunity granted to it by history and utilize various conditions to expedite its own development itself. The front page of BEIJING RIBAO on 12 January carried, with a major headline, a speech by Chen Xitong, the party secretary of Beijing Municipality. The speech was entitled "Boldly Emancipating the Mind." He said that to establish a new system, it is necessary to "boldly charge forward, to blaze a new trail, and to take risks"; and to continue emancipating the minds, it is also necessary to "boldly charge forward, to blaze a new trail, and to take risks." Chen Xitong said that only by emancipating the mind can new ways of thinking be found and bold measures be taken. If one fears the wolves in front and the tigers behind, like a woman with bound feet who dares not do this and that, doing minor things but not big things, then one cannot walk at a big pace. Chen Xitong urged his subordinates to "stretch your arms and work vigorously, get started, and run quickly," to expedite reform and opening up.
