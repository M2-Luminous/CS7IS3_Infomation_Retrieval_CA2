Chief Minister Nelson Ramodike said, in a statement this afternoon, that the tension between his government and the Department of Regional and Land Affairs, which controls the finances of the region, was the cause of the collapse of services. Thirty-thousand striking civil servants have virtually crippled the Lebowa government. The situation came to a head today when members of the police force began a sit-in. They said they had been promised salary increases which never materialized. Isolated incidents of violence have also been reported, and at least three government vehicles were set alight in Seshego.
