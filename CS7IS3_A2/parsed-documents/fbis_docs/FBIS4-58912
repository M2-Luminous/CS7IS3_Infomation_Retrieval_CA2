No official statement has yet been issued by the prime minister on the reasons for his decision to remain at home. However, informed sources have told the MENA correspondent that Prime Minister al-Hariri is facing difficulties in reshuffling his cabinet with a view to improving the chances of Christian representation in the Lebanese Government to remedy the frustration felt by the Christians in Lebanon. The sources said al-Hariri's decision does not mean he will resign. The MENA correspondent says several ministers, as well as political, religious, and military figures, including Army Commander Gen. Emile Lahhud, have visited al-Hariri at his mansion in the Quraytim area of Beirut to ask him to change his mind. Informed sources in Beirut say al-Hariri's decision to stop doing his job has moved what could be considered a cabinet crisis into the Lebanese streets. In the past few days there has been a lot of speculation in the press and in political quarters about an imminent cabinet reshuffle to include some Christian political figures in the government, such as Phalangist Party leader Dr. George Sa'adah, plus a member from the National Liberal Party and other Christian figures. The situation is still vague regarding the fate of the Lebanese Government. Prime Minister al-Hariri canceled a radio and television interview that was scheduled to be aired live tonight, in which he would have addressed questions and speculations about a possible cabinet reshuffle.
