FR940419-2-00175 FR940419-2-00087 State WQS authorities, NPDES authorities, EPA regional offices, permittees, and the public should meet early and frequently throughout the long-term CSO control planning process. Development of the long-term plan should be coordinated with the review and appropriate revision of WQS and implementation procedures on CSO-impacted waters to ensure that the long-term controls will be sufficient to meet water quality standards. As part of these meetings, participants should agree on the data, information and analyses needed to support the development of the long-term CSO control plan and the review of applicable WQS, and implementation procedures, if appropriate. Agreements should be reached on the monitoring protocols and models that will be used to evaluate the water quality impacts of the overflows, to analyze the attainability of the WQS and to determine the water quality-based requirements for the permit. Many opportunities exist for permittees and States to share information as control programs are developed and as WQS are reviewed. Such information should assist States in determining the need for revisions to WQS and implementation procedures to better reflect the site-specific wet weather impacts of CSOs. Coordinating the development of the long-term CSO control plan and the review of the WQS and implementation procedures provides greater assurance that the long-term control plan selected and the limits and requirements included in the NPDES permit will be sufficient to meet WQS and to comply with sections 301(b)(1)(C) and 402(a)(2) of the CWA. EPA encourages States and permittees jointly to sponsor workshops for the affected public in the development of the long-term CSO control plan and during the development of appropriate revisions to WQS for CSO-impacted waters. Workshops provide a forum for including the public in discussions of the implications of the proposed long-term CSO control plan on the water quality and uses for the receiving water. B. Water Quality Standards Reviews The CWA requires States to periodically, but at least once every three years, hold public hearings for the purpose of reviewing applicable water quality standards and, as appropriate, modifying and adopting standards. States must provide the public an opportunity to comment on any proposed revision to water quality standards and all revisions must be submitted to EPA for review and approval. EPA regulations and guidance provide States with the flexibility to adapt their WQS, and implementation procedures to reflect site-specific conditions including those related to CSOs. For example, a State may adopt site-specific criteria for a particular pollutant if the State determines that the site-specific criteria fully protects the designated use (40 CFR 131.11). In addition, the regulations at 40 CFR 131.10(g), (h), and (j) specify when and how a designated use may be modified. A State may remove a designated use from its water quality standards only if the designated use is not an existing use. An existing use is a use actually attained in the water body on or after November 28, 1975. Furthermore, a State may not remove a designated use that will be attained by implementing the technology-based effluent limits required under sections 301(b) and 306 of the CWA and by implementing cost-effective and reasonable best management practices for nonpoint source controls. Thus, if a State has a reasonable basis to determine that the current designated use could be attained after implementation of the technology-based controls of the CWA, then the use could not be removed. In determining whether a use is attainable and prior to removing a designated use, States must conduct and submit to EPA a use attainability analysis. A use attainability analysis is a structured scientific assessment of the factors affecting the use, including the physical, chemical, biological, and economic factors described in 40 CFR 131.10(g). As part of the analysis, States should evaluate whether the designated use could be attained if CSO controls were implemented. For example, States should examine if sediment loadings from CSOs could be reduced so as not to bury spawning beds, or if biochemical oxygen demanding material in the effluent or the toxicity of the effluent could be corrected so as to reduce the acute or chronic physiological stress on or bioaccumulation potential of aquatic organisms. In reviewing the attainability of their WQS and the applicability of their implementation procedures to CSO-impacted waters, States are encouraged to define more explicitly their recreational and aquatic life uses and then, if appropriate, modify the criteria accordingly to protect the designated uses.
