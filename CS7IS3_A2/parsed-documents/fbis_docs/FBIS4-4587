He said he strongly protested the incorrect move taken by the Thai Government. He said it constituted a real violation of human rights. The statement was addressed to Sadako Ogata, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Ogata, the Washington government, and humanitarian organizations formally protested the repatriation to the Thai Government but Thai leaders denied the allegation. Cambodian refugees, mostly women and children, fled the fighting in Pailin after government forces took over the Khmer Rouge stronghold in the province on 19 March. The Thai military, however, insisted that the Cambodian refugees wanted to return to their respective areas under Khmer Rouge control. Nobody has been allowed into the area for observation. The Cambodian foreign minister said that he profoundly regrets the Thai Government's inhuman act, which contradicts efforts by human rights organizations to achieve equality and to find a solution to human rights abuse. During his visit to Thailand last week for talks with the Thai Government on the problem of Cambodian refugees, the Cambodian foreign minister adopted an entirely different attitude regarding his reproach of the Thai Government.
