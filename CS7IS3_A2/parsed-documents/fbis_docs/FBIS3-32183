[Begin recording] [Enriquez] The president of the Republic must defend the government. As a staunch defender of human rights, he would not like to hear that there have been violations of those rights during his presidential term. Unfortunately, there have been a few cases during the six or seven months since he assumed power. Those are the cases mentioned by the State Department. This was not a report but a statement expressing its position with regard to the Civilian Self-Defense Patrols [PAC]. That position is well-known in Guatemala and has resulted in significant reduction in the number of voluntary patrols. Right now only 40 percent of those patrols still exist, most of them in the Departments of Huehuetenango, El Quiche, and Alta Verapaz, where subversive groups are still present, which is the why those patrols were created. The president of the Republic has explained all that. In addition, during a visit to the United States at the invitation of General Sullivan, chief of staff of the U.S. Armed Forces [title as heard], I met with representatives of various nongovernmental human rights organizations and State Department officials. I also visited the Pentagon for the first time. I must say that during my meetings with nongovernmental organizations, representatives from [words indistinct], Americas Watch, Attorneys for Human Rights, including (Jennifer Harbury), they were very sincere and broadminded about our situation. I believe the government should also try to continue this kind of communication, because many countries know only one side of the story. [Reporter] The State Department's report said that the members of the Armed Forces, PAC, and the National Police are the ones conducting these actions, including a majority of extrajudicial executions. Do you agree or disagree? [Enriquez] I agree, to a certain extent, because we cannot deny that there have been some actions by PAC, for example the case in Colotenango, which fortunately is already being handled by the court. There have been other cases, like the regrettable case of Jorge Carpio Nicole. Although those responsible have not been fully identified, we strongly condemn these actions, which should not occur in Guatemala. There have also been cases of military policemen involved in bank holdups and national policemen who have made mistakes. There really have been very few violations of human rights in the past year. What has increased is the number of cases reported. I believe 13,000 cases were reported, but there is no evidence in these. We are aware of the situation. We deeply regret the case of Jorge Carpio Nicole; we want to find out who was responsible, so the weight of the law will fall on the culprits. We suspect this was done the [word indistinct] because they have killed many people. There are still many doubts, but we believe the case will be resolved. The case of the PAC in Colotenango has already been settled. Now that the human rights meeting in Geneva is coming up, some groups are trying to revive cases that occurred in 1989-92. But the truth is that there has been significant progress in Guatemala with regard to respect for human and individual and political rights. Now there is more awareness of the people's social and economic rights, but this will take time, and violations will cease as Guatemalans' standard of living improves. It will not be easy. The police, the Army, the government, the PAC are the ones usually accused because in the opinion of many statesmen and according to, let's say, ideas held in common all over the world, only the state can violate human rights because it is the guarantor, it is responsible for guaranteeing respect for human rights. But at the last two meetings in Geneva the URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] was also condemned because blowing up electricity towers is indeed a human rights violation, blowing up bridges is indeed a human rights violation. That is sheer ingratitude; this is a poor country with many infrastructural needs, and they carry out those attacks to the detriment of the right to free movement and against life, by preventing the supply of electrical energy. I know of the problems and the torment the hospitals ensure with those sudden blackouts, during which some people have even died. [end recording]
