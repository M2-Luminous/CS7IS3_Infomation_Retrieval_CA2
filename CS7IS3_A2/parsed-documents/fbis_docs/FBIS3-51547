According to him, since 1985 economic aid has declined and will continue to decline until 1996, when it will disappear completely. Consequently, the central government has prepared a series of plans aimed at solving the situation in a firm and specific manner. [Begin recording] [Salaverria] Our plans have been made taking into account the projected aid reduction. The news has just been publicized, but we knew six to eight months ago that aid would be reduced. Now, when you referred to an aid package last year totaling over $200 million, this includes other forms of aid and not direct aid. For instance, during the war there were years in which we received approximately $100 million worth of military aid. Now we have no military aid, as we no longer need it because the war is over. This may be the great difference in all this. Later, military aid was cut to $90 million, $70 million, $40 million, and so on. It was difficult to keep it at $13 million last year. And now we are faced with no military aid, because we do not have a war. [Unidentified reporter] However [words indistinct] reconstruction of the country [words indistinct] made calls to help. Several governments offered assistance [words indistinct] offers have not materialized. Does the Foreign Ministry [words indistinct] to bring in this aid? [Salaverria] Yes. This effort to receive aid offers is an everyday task not only for the Foreign Relations Ministry, but also for the Planning and Finance Ministries. [end recording] Meanwhile, the official stressed that Salvadorans who have relatives in Los Angeles, California, must advise them to appear before the Federal Administration for Managing Emergencies, known by its English acronym, FEMA, or call this institution at 1-800-525-0321, or call the Los Angeles Red Cross at 213-739-4543 to receive aid. Salaverria explained U.S. institutions provide humanitarian aid to all persons, regardless of their official immigration status, which basically is not considered in determining humanitarian assistance to disaster victims.
