In keeping with the established program, we met with President Franjo Tudjman and Prime Minister Nikica Valentic, with members of the government and other officials from the local administration leaderships, such as the Zagreb City Hall and the Pula City Hall, and with other prominent figures from the area and from Rijeka. We also visited several economic units. At the same time, the visit gave us the opportunity to discuss all matters pertaining to the development of bilateral relations, beginning with political issues, whereby the Croatian officials requested Romania's further support, in view of our principled position of applying equal treatment to all states in the former Yugoslav space. They asked that we should play a more active role in solving the current problems in that area. We also gave priority to economic matters, with both sides pointing out the many opportunities for developing and expanding our relations of cooperation and trade exchanges and for setting up joint companies. Of course, we are dealing here with a pretty broad program. However, the important thing is that all officials we met there asked that Romania should become involved in the projects for the reconstruction of the areas affected by the war. Here is a propitious field for an active participation of Romania, with various companies, in these programs. We also had a talk with the economy minister from the Croatian-Muslim Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, who also asked for an active presence by Romania in the reconstruction areas. Of course, we are directly interested in all these projects, which have been assured of foreign financing. I would like to add here that three important agreements were signed on the occasion of the visit. I am referring to the agreement on mutually guaranteeing and protecting investments, the agreement on maritime transportation, and an agreement on cooperation in the health sphere. We are in the process of finalizing an agreement on avoiding double taxation and an agreement between the Chambers of Trade and Industry of the two countries. Generally speaking, I would say that all the visited units expressed their interest in the resumption of our cooperation ventures, since there has been a sort of tradition -- one may say -- of cooperation in machine building, in the production of naval engines by Romanian and Croatian shipyards, as well as in metallurgy, the food industry, and the pharmaceutical industry. Therefore, we discussed a broad range of opportunities. In conclusion, I would say that this visit to Croatia has practically been a continuation of the very efficient dialogue that took place during the respective visits of the two presidents -- I am referring to President Ion Iliescu's visit to Croatia and President Franjo Tudjman's visit to Romania -- and took place in the spirit of the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation existing between the two countries. We jointly agreed that a number of delegations -- particularly from the big companies and concerns -- should come to Romania in the forthcoming period to put the final touches to the agreements we have reached during this visit. Of course, we also discussed various other problems, such as our relations in the cultural, education, science, and sports spheres. We have already concluded a few accords in this respect. However, our greatest shortcoming is when we come to concretely implementing all these understandings. Consequently, in the forthcoming period, we plan to work out concrete action programs for a two-year period, which can facilitate a constant flow of information in both directions, a better understanding between the two sides, and obviously mutual support for the economies of both countries. I would add here our intention -- which is also in accordance with the requests of our hosts -- to open a direct Bucharest-Zagreb air link, which can also ensure further connections with other areas, including such far away targets as Singapore, Australia, and Brazil, where there is a substantial Croat diaspora. This would be quite useful, and I hope that we will manage to achieve this goal in the coming months.
