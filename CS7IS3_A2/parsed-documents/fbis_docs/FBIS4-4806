"This is a rude act of the `civilian' fascist group mocking the envoys of peace from different countries, ignoring the elementary international usage and courtesy and morality," the spokesman said. Noting that the Kim Yong-sam fascist group barred the northern trip of the foreign envoys of peace through Panmunjom by applying to them the uncouth fascist act of blocking the home people's visit to the North, and thus made it quite plain that South Korea is a barren land of human rights under the "civilian" dictatorship and the Kim Yong-sam regime is an anti-peace group, he said: "The Kim Yong-sam group blocked their Pyongyang visit because it was deadly afraid that they might sympathize with the just stand of the North which is pursuing a policy of independent reunification and a nuclear-free peace policy which are totally contrary to its flunkeyist splittist policy and war moves. This fully shows which of the North and the South of the Korean peninsula is a closed fascist society and which of them is a democratic society, who seeks confrontation, war and division and who wants peace and peaceful reunification."
