"The president had earlier been on a three-day trip around Europe, where he had to contend with the difficult problems of security in the world which have arisen since the end of the Cold War." Clinton stopped off in Ukraine en route to Moscow and concluded a deal there whereby all the former Soviet nuclear missiles on Ukrainian territory will be handed over to Russia, the report commented. "There has actually been no use whatsoever for these weapons. They have been targeted on the United States, with which Ukraine most of all wants to enjoy friendly relations." London, 13 Jan -- THE DAILY TELEGRAPH writes: The American president's television address to the people of Russia could be the most important feature of the American president's visit to Moscow. If Clinton strikes the right note, appeals to the Russians' pride and patriotism, and refrains from delivering a lecture on the theme of the free market and democracy he will improve relations between the two countries. But if he is unable to do this, it will only intensify skepticism regarding the "American Dream," which is something now manifest not just among extremists. Paris, 13 Jan -- The success of the political and economic reforms in Russia will lead to the reform of the Russian state's foreign policy, LE MONDE thinks, noting that this explains Clinton's desire to support Yeltsin. The American president is convinced that a democratic Russia will not threaten its neighbors or show hegemonic tendencies in Europe, but not all members of his administration share such a viewpoint. In assessing the Russian-American summit talks now under way the newspaper opines that the United States will pressure the IMF to be more energetic in granting financial aid.
