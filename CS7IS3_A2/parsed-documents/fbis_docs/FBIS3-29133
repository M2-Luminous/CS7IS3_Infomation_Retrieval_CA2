"We do not have an understanding yet that the U.S. Government officially approved such action," Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference. But "I hope the U.S. side will refrain from taking unilateral action of retaliation." He said such action would close the door to dialogue between the two nations. The U.S. is considering taking retaliatory action against Japan's cellular phone market, saying full foreign participation in the market is restricted. The move comes after the breakdown of trade negotiations held under a bilateral framework trade accord concluded last July. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said Monday Japan will make voluntary efforts to whittle down its trade surplus with the U.S. before the summit of the Group of Seven major economic powers in Naples, Italy, in July.
