According to Niehaus, a candidate for post of OAS secretary general, "bloodshed" has to be avoided in Cuba, and a change in Cuba's current political system -- a system that has been in place for more than 30 years -- has to be achieved through dialogue and respect for the people's self-determination. The head of Costa Rican diplomacy said: "None of us want our Cuban brothers to shed one drop of blood. We have to talk to them to avoid this. They are part of the American family that is outside" the OAS because of the isolation decreed against it by the organization in the 1960's. Nevertheless, Niehaus warned that for Cuba to be readmitted as a member of the American community of nations, it has to respectfully adhere to the principles of the OAS Charter and to the defense of human rights. In this sense, the foreign minister said, he agreed that Cuba should not be invited to any American Summit -- the next summit has been scheduled in the United States at the end of 1994 -- until a democratic change takes place on the island governed by Fidel Castro, the Marxist leader who took power in the 1959 revolution. According to Niehaus, had Western Europe isolated the Soviet Union, "we would still have the USSR." In this way, he reiterated that it was counterproductive to continue using the method of isolation to achieve change in Cuba. Regarding the renewal of relations between Cuba and Costa Rica, which were broken off more than 30 years ago, Niehaus said this is not the only way to get closer to the Havana regime, and he added that Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon was the one who had to ultimately decide this issue. Today Niehaus met with foreign reporters covering Costa Rica's electoral process that ends tomorrow with the election of a new president, two vice presidents, 57 deputies, and authorities for the 81 Costa Rican municipalities.
