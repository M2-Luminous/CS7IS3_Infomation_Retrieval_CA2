"We are concerned. There are enormous gaps in our knowledge about the effects of environmental toxins. We know they are extremely toxic even in small quantities and that they become concentrated in the food chain and in nature because they fail to break down," said SFT Director Harald Rensvik. Yesterday SFT published its new comprehensive report on environmental toxins in Norway. The previous one came out six years ago. The main conclusions are clear: Norwegian emissions have been radically reduced since 1985. In the case of many environmental toxins, industrial spillage into the waterways has been reduced by more than 90 percent. Nevertheless, environmental toxins are a greater threat to nature and the health of Norwegians than ever before. The problem is that, once emitted, pollutants remain in nature, and with the constant influx of toxins from abroad, environmental authorities fear that the tolerance threshold will soon be reached. Although unable to predict what will happen, where it will happen, or when, environmental authorities know that serious environmental problems are developing in the natural world around us. We receive greater quantities of many of the most dangerous environmental toxins from abroad than we produce ourselves. The major portion is carried on the air and wind from power plants and industries on the continent. Some also come on the ocean currents. "Approximately four tons of cadmium is dumped on the Norwegian environment each year. Three of these come from other countries, while our own emissions account for just one ton. The proportions are similar for other toxins," said Rensvik. SFT says in its report that the work of reducing Norwegian emissions must continue. "We used the easiest and cheapest methods. The percentage that remains must also be eliminated if the fjords and nature areas ruined by Norwegian pollution are to be completely restored. There is still a long way to go before crabs can be fished out of the Frie Fjord. But it is entirely within the realm of possibility to get there," Rensvik said. While most Norwegian toxic waste has a concrete source that can be identified and cleaned up, it is harder in the case of foreign pollutants. Norwegian pollutants harm one end of a fjord or the flora and fauna of a limited region. Pollutants from abroad are spread over the entire country by means of rain, wind, and ocean currents. This means that the authorities have limited knowledge of how long it will be until nature's tolerance threshold is reached: "In terms of climate, the Norwegian environment is in grave trouble. We fear that unforeseen harm can arise as a result of constantly increasing amounts of cadmium, mercury, and other environmental toxins that are out there," said Rensvik. The director of SFT points out that scientists know too little to say what will happen on the day the tolerance threshold is exceeded. But Rensvik can mention several possibilities: severe poisoning, species that become extinct, species that have problems with reproduction, mutations, injury to the nervous system. Because substances are concentrated in the food chain, they can affect people through eating such things as reindeer meat. "We conclude that Norway must continue to work for further reductions both at home and abroad. Because even though our own emissions have been cut down, the danger to Norway's natural resources has not been dramatically reduced," said Rensvik. The report reveals that scientists have discovered disturbing amounts of the environmental toxins PCB [polychlorinated biphenyl] and PAH [expansion unknown] in the Skagerrak trough and the Norwegian channels, in addition to the known quantities of imported pollutants. Recent investigations have also evidenced high concentrations of PCB's in the fatty tissues of polar bears and Arctic foxes on Spitzbergen. It is believed that PCB's can lead to a reduced capacity to breed, a weakened immune system, and behavioral disturbances--especially in sea mammals. The toxins congregate far from the source, and the effects of this are unclear. The reason why advisories have been issued to those who eat fish and shellfish caught in the fjords is because of earlier toxin emissions from Norwegian industries. For some of these fjords, the restrictions have been reduced. In the meantime, they have been expanded somewhat in other areas because new and better studies have been done.
