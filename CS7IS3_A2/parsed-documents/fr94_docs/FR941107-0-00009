FR941107-0-00009 FR941107-0-00004 Major expense categories for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year include $5,572,500 for advertising, $276,340 for SOPP data research, $276,340 for winter pear improvement, $142,310 for salaries and benefits, and $612,442 for unshared contingency. An interim final rule was issued on August 22, 1994, and published in the Federal Register [59 FR 44023, August 26, 1994] and provided a 30-day comment period for interested persons. No comments were received. While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs should be significantly offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It is found that the specified expenses for the marketing order covered in this rule are reasonable and likely to be incurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rate to cover such expenses will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register [5 U.S.C. 553] because the Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis. The 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year for the program began July 1, 1994. The marketing order requires that the rate of assessment apply to all assessable winter pears handled during the fiscal year. In addition, handlers are aware of this action which was recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and published in the Federal Register as an interim final rule. No comments were received concerning the interim final rule that is adopted in this action as a final rule without change.
