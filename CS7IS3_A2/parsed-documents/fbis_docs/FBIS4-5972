The lack of communications and the insight of trade opportunities in both countries is also another factor affecting the trade expansion. This was stated by Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed when addressing a seminar attended by businessmen of the two countries in Vientiane, Laos. The two-way trade amounted to only U.S. $18 million although several Malaysians had invested in many projects in the country such as road building and hotel renovation. The prime minister expressed confidence that cooperation in various fields could be increased. The prime minister arrived in the Laotian capital today on a second leg of a visit to Cambodia and Laos. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir is expected to sign a bilateral payment arrangement pact to boost commercial ties with Laos.
