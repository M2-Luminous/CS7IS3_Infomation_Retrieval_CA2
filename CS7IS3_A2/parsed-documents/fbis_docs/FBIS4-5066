The survey showed that 33 percent of the Ainu families interviewed on Hokkaido said they find it "tough" to make ends meet, while another 44 percent opted to characterize it as "somewhat difficult." A total of 300 Ainu families in Hokkaido, where most of Japan's Ainu live, were interviewed last June for the survey, which has been conducted every seven years since 1972. Despite complaints about difficulties in earning a livelihood, the survey showed that ratio of Ainu receiving welfare payments from the government fell from 60.9 per 1,000 population in the last survey, undertaken in 1986, to 38.8 per 1,000 population in the current survey. The survey said Hokkaido's Ainu population stood at 23,830, or a decrease of 551 over the last survey. There are few remaining full-blooded Ainu in Japan. Counted as Ainu in the survey were those thought to have at least some Ainu blood or those living in families with members who have Ainu blood. The survey said the percentage of Ainu children going on to senior high school increased by 9 points to 87.4 percent, though it fell short of the 96.3 percent overall figure for Hokkaido children. A bigger gap surfaced in the figures for those children proceeding to university or college, with 11.8 percent for the relevant Ainu population compared with 27.5 percent for the overall population. In a questionnaire targeting Ainu aged 15 and older, only 7.3 percent said they faced incidences of discrimination over the past six or seven years, while 62 percent said they had not. Officials said the Hokkaido Prefectural Government intends to use the survey in planning its future Ainu welfare policies.
