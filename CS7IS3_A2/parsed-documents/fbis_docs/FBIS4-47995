He spoke to the media at a news conference in Ulundi today. [Begin Buthelezi recording] I would like to express my deep gratitude and appreciation to the people of South Africa in their entirety. It was their commitment, after all, to democracy, evidenced in the way they ran to the polls to try and (?overcome) the adverse circumstances, which makes it possible for me to state that I accept this election in the interest of reconciliation, as sufficiently fair and free, to enable us to move forward, at least. I say so within the acknowledgment of the fact that of all the imperfections that the first election held, you know, we have had problems in the last few days -- each and every one of you as fellow South Africans, in your thousands and millions, have flocked to ballot stations to place your mark for the new South Africa. In sunshine and in rain and despite the countless frustrations you experienced you maintained your resolve and determination, and for this I thank you my fellow South Africans. [end recording]
