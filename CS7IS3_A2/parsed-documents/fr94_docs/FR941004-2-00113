FR941004-2-00113 FR941004-2-00068 Technical review of Doc. 9.19.1 will continue and the U.S. may offer further comment on the affected resolutions before or during the COP. The United States supports deletions of resolutions that are out of date or no longer relevant. However, recent discussions in the International Whaling Commission (IWC) highlight the fact that illegal trade in whale products continues, in spite of the IWC's moratorium on commercial whaling. The United States has requested that this item be discussed at COP9 (see agenda item 15). The IWC has not yet completed an observation, inspection and enforcement program which would certify that the products of any commercial whaling which occurs in the future are taken in compliance with IWC regulations. Therefore, the admonitions contained in Resolutions Conf. 2.8 and 3.13 appear to the United States to be as pertinent today as when they were adopted by the Parties. These resolutions are neither out of date, nor have they been superseded. Therefore, the United States opposes deletion of these resolutions. The United States opposes deletion of the aspects pertaining to plants in Conf. 2.18, 4.24, 6.18, and 8.17(b) and 8.17(c), which provide an important legal basis, which is different from using a limited departure from Conf. 5.9 on what is readily recognizable, to guide the standard exclusion or exemption from CITES provisions of certain specified parts and derivatives of certain plants, e.g., the cut flowers of artificially propagated Appendix I hybrids and the flasked seedlings of all artificially propagated orchids. Future germane proposals on taxa for Appendix I simply can be directed by Conf. 8.17(b) and 8.17(c), without subsequent proposals on the standard exemptions. Future proposals to uplist orchid taxa thus would be routinely guided by Conf. 8.17(c) and their flasked seedlings would be exempt. A similar process has been in effect for the proposals on Appendix II plant taxa, where routinely certain parts or derivatives are standard exclusions, as specified through Conf. 4.24 (e.g., for tissue cultures) and Conf. 6.18 (e.g., for flasked seedling cultures). (b) Consolidation of valid resolutions. No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet. However, documents have been received at several Standing Committee meetings. The United States essentially supports those consolidations prepared thus far by the Secretariat; a review finds them to be a diligent and accurate consolidation of a complex array of resolutions dealing with the same subject. Proposed consolidations have been discussed at Standing Committee meetings and approved for transmission to the Parties on the following issues (final text has not yet been received from the Secretariat, however): Transport of live specimens (consolidate Conf. 3.16, 4.20, 5.18, 7.13, and 8.12); Disposal of illegally traded specimens (consolidate Conf. 2.15, 3.9, 3.14, 4.17, 4.18, 5.14, and 7.6); Trade in elephant ivory (consolidate Conf. 3.12, 6.12, 6.14, 6.15, 6.16, and 7.8); Annual reports and trade monitoring (consolidate Conf. 2.16, 3.10, 5.5, 5.6, 5.14, and 8.7); Trade in readily recognizable parts and derivatives (consolidate Conf. 4.8, 5.9, 5.22, and 6.22); Permits and certificates (consolidate Conf. 3.6, 3.7, 4.9, 4.16, 5.7, 5.8, 5.15, 6.6, 8.5); Trade in plants (12 prior resolutions: consolidate Conf. 2.13, 5.14, 5.15, 8.17, propose to repeal all or part of Conf. 2.18, 4.24, 5.14, 6.18, and 6.20, and deal with Conf. 2.14, 4.16, and parts of 5.14, 8.18, 8.19 in a separate consolidation); Trade with non-Parties and reserving Parties (consolidate Conf. 3.8, 8.8); and Transit and transhipment (consolidate Conf. 4.10, 7.4). 2. Establishment of a List of the Other Decisions of the Conference of the Parties No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet. Support ongoing Standing Committee and Secretariat efforts to differentiate between Resolutions of the Conference of the Parties which provide guidance and interpretation of the Convention, or call for continuing activities of indefinite duration, and decisions of the COP that direct the Secretariat or permanent committees to perform certain specific activities of limited duration. The Standing Committee has recommended that decisions of the Parties at the COP be distributed in a manner similar to that for resolutions. The United States supports this procedure, utilizing guidelines to be adopted by the COP, that have been approved by the Standing Committee. Often, recommendations to the Secretariat or permanent committees are included in resolutions, when these recommendations are relevant for a particular committee only, or for a short time period between two COPs only. The United States supports separating these specific and/or short-term decisions from resolutions, wherein resolutions should refer to recommendations for implementation of the Convention, and interpretations of the Convention. 3. Report on National Reports Under Article VIII, Paragraph 7, of the Convention No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet. Support efforts to encourage all Parties to submit annual reports, for all species of flora and fauna, consistent with their domestic legislation. Support efforts whereby proposals for transfer of certain species from Appendix I to II with an export quota or pursuant to ranching only be considered for Parties that are current with their annual report submissions. Each Party is required by the Convention to submit an annual report containing a summary of the permits it has granted, and the types and numbers of specimens of species in the CITES Appendices that it has imported and exported. Accurate report data are essential to measure the impact of international trade on species, and can be a useful enforcement tool. 4.
