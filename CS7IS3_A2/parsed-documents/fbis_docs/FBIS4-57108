FBIS4-57108 "drlat093_a_94013" FBIS-LAT-94-093 Daily Report 13 May 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Roundup of Criminal, Judicial Actions Roundup of Criminal, Judicial Actions FL1205234794 FL1205234794 BFN [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of fileworthy reports on criminal activity and related judicial actions in Cuba between 25 April and 9 May. Radio Progreso at 1100 GMT on 25 April reports that "state enterprises have become the principal supply source for the black market, not only because they handle the greatest quantity of resources but because of their lack of control over the goods for which they are responsible. To this we must add that there are also authorities so corrupt that they are capable of stealing raw materials and merchandise in order to supply the underground economy with the sole purpose of enriching themselves illegally and enjoying a lifestyle very greatly above their real means." The report refers to theft from the Detergent and Soap Enterprise, formerly Sabatez, in Cerro Municipality, Havana City Province. The Crimes Against the Economy section of the Havana City Province Police Operations Unit, upon learning that detergent had been unloaded at a residence near the enterprise, searched the home of Lazaro Ruiz Cutino, who has a criminal record and a history of terrible social conduct, and seized 40 sacks of detergent. Four enterprise workers -- a warehouse inspector, warehouse chief, and two loader operators -- had stolen the detergent through the negligence of the production area's brigade chief in transporting the sacks to the warehouse. The radio notes: "In certain thefts of merchandise that have occurred at state enterprises, police investigators have verified participation in crimes on the part of people in positions of responsibility, to the sole end of illegally increasing their personal wealth." The seven citizens arrested had shared 50,000 pesos for the stolen detergent. They will be tried for the crime of serious theft. The detergent was recovered and the money seized from the defendants was turned over to the court. Radio Progreso Network at 1100 GMT on 9 May reports that two men were arrested for trying to steal five arrobas of potatoes to sell on the black market. The men, Ignacio Andres Gorrero, manager of a grocery store that sells agricultural products, and Faustino Paz Cabrera, driver of the municipal harvesting company, were caught by the police, who recovered a portion of the stolen potatoes. The driver had already dropped off over five quintals of potatoes at the grocery store in question, to be sold by the corrupt administrator at six pesos per pound.
