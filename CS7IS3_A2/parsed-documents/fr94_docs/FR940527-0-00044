FR940527-0-00044 FR940527-0-00016 33 CFR Part 165 CGD01&hyph;94&hyph;030] RIN 2115&hyph;AA97 Safety Zone; Narragansett Bay, Quonset Point, RI AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Temporary final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone on June 4 and 5, 1994, at Quonset Point, North Kingstown, RI, while aerial demonstrations are performed in preparation for and during the Rhode Island Air National Guard Open House. This action is necessary to protect spectator and pleasure craft, as well as other vessels in the vicinity, from the risks associated with low flying aircraft. EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation is effective between 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. on June 4, 1994 and between 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. on June 5, 1994 unless terminated sooner by the Captain of the Port. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: LTJG Timothy Pavilonis of Marine Safety Office Providence at (401) 435&hyph;2300. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Drafting Information The drafters of this regulation were Lieutenant (junior grade) T. Pavilonis, Project Manager for the Coast Guard Captain of the Port Providence, and Lieutenant Commander J. Stieb, Project Counsel for the First Coast Guard District Legal Office. Regulatory History As authorized by 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) was not published for this regulation and good cause exists for making it effective less than 30 days after Federal Register publication. Due to the date on which this application was received, there was insufficient notice to publish proposed rules in advance of the event. Publishing a NPRM and delaying the event would be contrary to the public interest. The air show is intended for public viewing and delaying the event would result in cancellation of the event due to the difficult of rescheduling participants. Background and Purpose The purpose of this rulemaking is to protect spectators and pleasure craft, as well as other vessels, from potential hazards associated with low level flight demonstrations. The demonstrations will take place in the airspace over the Quonset State Airport, North Kingstown, RI, a portion of the Naval Construction Battalion Center in Davisville, RI, and a small area of Narragansett Bay adjacent to the Quonset State Airport. Regulatory Evaluation This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. The entities affected by this rulemaking effort are pleasure craft and fishing vessels. Large commercial vessel transits through the waters contained in this safety zone are infrequent, approximately 3 per month. Commercial fishing vessels are able to conduct operations outside the Quonset Channel because they are not constrained by their draft. There are other areas available outside of the safety zone where normal fishing operations may be conducted. Therefore, restricting access to the area as proposed will not cause undue hardship to any entity. Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). For the reasons discussed in the Regulatory Evaluation, the Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this rule to be minimal and the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq .), that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ) Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this final rule in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and had determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of these regulations and concluded that under section 2.B.2.C of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, they are an action to protect public safety and are categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket.
