Through the end of 1993, the annual increase rate of loans to rural enterprises was 35.9 percent, up 63 times over the period just after Agricultural Bank rehabilitation. The Agricultural Bank and credit cooperatives have loaned to more than one million of these enterprises. This includes a group of backbone enterprises with total annual output value of several 100 million to several billion yuan which constitute the nuclear force of rural enterprises. In the development process, the contradiction of a shortage of funds in rural enterprises is fully prominent, becoming an issue to which everyone pays attention. The reasons for this problem are: One, excessive fixed asset investment, with the pace of development surpassing the capacity funds can bear. Two, disorderly financial order with rural funds seriously split. Random fund accumulation and lending against regulat ions not only blindly expanded the scale of investment, increased the need for circulating funds, and slowed savings deposit increases by banks and credit cooperatives, but also affected rural enterprise loan supply progress. Three, some rural enterprises have economic results that are not ideal. This is reflected in bank credit. The issues of overly tight credit, slow turnover, poor results and great risk still are relatively prominent. Overdue and idle loans and bad debts continue to increase and the principle and interest on a considerable portion of loans cannot be repaid on time. Rural enterprise idle loans and bad debts have reached a certain proportion affecting loan turnover utilization. According to the spirit of the 1993 annual national rural enterprise work conference, important links to promote the healthy development of rural enterprises are doing all to relieve the current contradiction of funds in short supply and improve fund utilization results. Toward this end, the Agricultural Bank and credit cooperatives bear an extremely heavy and arduous burden. We will adopt several main measures: 1. Hold steadfastly to both collecting funds, taking stock of funds, and expanding the dynamics of credit input. Utilize interest rate readjustment and financial order rectification, mobilize rural workers to save actively and expand fund sources. At the same time, strengthen accounting services for rural enterprises that continuously expand new accounts, do a good job of enterprise time deposits and public deposits and one of peasant household fund accumulation management, increase the useable amount of rural credit funds, and strive to realize funds needed within plans on the scale of rural enterprise loans. Look within to resolve the funding difficulties of rural enterprises, ferret out potential, accelerate turnover of the more than 210 billion in credit and improve fund utilization results. Definitely take stock of sedimentary credit funds, recoup overdue and idle rural enterprise loans. Make credit funds flow back smoothly, accelerate turnover with one yuan of money playing the role of several yuan. An important way to ameliorate rural enterprise funding difficulties is to use fund increase superiority to spur on taking stock of savings to create a good credit and enterprise fund input and output cycle. 2. Firmly uphold the principles of suiting measures to local conditions and divided guidance. Further improve regional credit policies. Actively support rural enterprises, particularly accelerating the development of rural enterprises in central and western China. Rural financial sectors must adhere to state unifie d planning and the principles of suiting measures to local conditions, a rational division of labor, each developing its strengths, and all developing together under the premise of respecting economic laws. Further improve and implement regional credit policies. The economic backwardness of the central and western areas compared to eastern China is caused by a lack of talent, transportation and communication difficulties, closed off information, and rather low degrees of market development. In these areas, the Agricultural Bank and credit cooperatives must fully develop the role of credit levers, coalesce all efforts, create conditions and help improve the development environment. For credit support in the central and western areas, we must "stress priorities and regard the rest equally," giving key support to national agricultural product production bases, poor areas, and national minority areas, fully developing the relatively ample and advantageous conditions of agricultural, mineral, water, land and human resources. Develop variegated forms of rural enterprises by using local materials at hand, having work suit workers, agriculture suit agriculture, and business suit business. While supporting existing enterprises well, act according to capabilities, develop strengths, and stress support of new projects such as agricultural and sideline food product processing, fund development and rural energy. The "sprinkling pepper" method [spreading investment among many small-scale projects] must be changed to suppport central and western rural enterprise development. Moderately accumulate funds, support enterprise on the road of concentrated, collective operations and development by joining together disparate areas. Stress support of and reliance on existing towns and enterprises as well as using the advantageous conditions of river coastal, coastal lines, and coastal borders. Backbone enterprises of a certain scale developed according to economic principles and various forms of enterprise groups spur on development of surrounding areas. Strictly control lending to blind establishment of small industrial development zones which ignore conditions, seize farmland, compete and rush headlong into action. China's east coast has become the most vital area for rural enterprise development. The Agricultural Bank and credit cooperatives develop their ov erall capabilities under the premise of implementing gross national credit readjustment and control policies, providing prefer ential loans for enterprises or projects which have low asset debts, good returns of scale, are high science and technology and high export earners, matching local and outside monies. Trial shareholding systems and cooperative shareholding systems plus collectively operated enterprises must gather experience and be boldly supported so that they are perfected more with grand plans restarted. To develop the east's leading role and promote regional economic and technological unity, the State Council proposed an important "east-west rural enterprise cooperation project" which the Agricultural Bank and credit cooperatives must investigate and study, actively participate in planning and select from these a group of projects with great influence, good results and comparatively strong radiating and attracting power. Unite these with adoption of combined loans, bank group loans, specific project loans, foreign exchange loans to promote regional economic coordination and promote rational economic compositions and development of overall strengths. 3. Firmly uphold the principles of differential treatment and supporting the best, and support industrial structure readjustment. Centered around improving economic results, prominently support key enterprises and projects, and implement the policy of supporting the strong and limiting the weak. Give preferential support in terms of loan scales and funds to industrial enterprises that accord with state industrial policies and produce saleable items, foreign exchange earning export enterprises and energy and raw materials projects of priority national development. Projects have to be ranked and arranged in categories. Support of projects with good market prospects and high forecasted economic results must be continued to ensure they are put into operation on time. There should firmly be no new loans to enterprises which have no future or make products that cannot be sold. Strictly control new projects and do not lend to projects which cannot raise their own funds, have poor results or reconstruct. Centralize funds to resolve the need for rational circulating funds of existing enterprises. At the same time, greatly support loans to enterprises with authority to import and export, use well special laons for "trade, industry and agriculture" export bases, spark plans and earmarked "scientific and techological development" project loans, and unite such loans with general loans for greater results. At the same time, greatly collect foreign exchange funds, enhance international accounting, and provide to export enterprises comprehensive, top quality, inexpensive, highly efficient financial services.
