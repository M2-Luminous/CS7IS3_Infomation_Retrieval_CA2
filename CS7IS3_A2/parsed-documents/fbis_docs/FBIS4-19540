[Baudis] Without great surprise. Whenever there is a new and rather unexpected element in public life, that always provokes some trouble and turmoil. That is inevitable. Moreover, the media world is such that negative remarks are taken up and reported more readily than positive remarks or encouragements. There have nonetheless been more encouragements than reservations! For some sections of the media, the result was a surprise. I understand there bitterness. When you support a candidate, you always find it difficult to accept that he was not chosen, especially because Jean-Francois Deniau is a man of great qualities. If I had not been appointed, my friends would have felt sadness or bitterness. It is human and logical. There is no reason to be surprised about it or to overdramatize things. [LE FIGARO] In addition to this surprise, some members of the RPR [Rally for the Republic] are likely to be sparing in their support. [Baudis] No, I am convinced that the majority parties will support and actively participate in the campaign. All the leaders have told me that. Just as the prime minister assured me of the government's support. [LE FIGARO] What do you think of the "other majority list," that of Philippe de Villiers? [Baudis] It is not another majority list, it is a dissident list whose approach is violently anti-European, radically different from the policy pursued by the government and supported by the majority. There is a single majority list and you will see in the next few days that this fact will be confirmed by all the political officials. Any other list is an attempt at division which hampers the majority and seeks to weaken it. I would like to add that our list is open to the different currents of thinking which coexist within the majority, it is a union list. What is interesting is that, in this election, we will see other lists whose candidates will all have voted yes or all have voted no in the Maastricht referendum. The only list which will be open to people who voted yes and people who voted no will be ours. This list will be the best reflection of France. and Moscow, as well as Riyadh, Muscat, and Abu Dhabi.
