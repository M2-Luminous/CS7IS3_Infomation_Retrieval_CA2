They delivered to the American Embassy a letter addressed to Perry, accusing Washington of "intentionally aggravating" tension on the Korean peninsula to benefit the U.S. defense industry and to sustain its world hegemony as the sole military power even though the Cold War is over. They also called on Perry to drop his earlier remark warning of a war against North Korea, to withdraw immediately all Patriot missiles from South Korea and to suspend the "Team Spirit" military exercise permanently. Meanwhile, Secretary Perry is slated to arrive here late Tuesday night, the Defense Ministry said.
