The study involved an analysis of NOAA meteorological space photographs at 1:25 000 000. A seismotectonic approach was used as the basis for this research. During this period there were ten nuclear tests in Kazakhstan and two in China. The distance between these test sites was 1200 km. In three cases there were no cloud lineaments because it was clear weather, in a fourth case there was a negative result, but in the other six cases, each of which is described in detail, there was a significant correlation between the nuclear shots and presence of cloud lineaments. A comparison of the times of appearance of cloud lineaments after explosions in Kazakhstan and China shows that in China the atmospheric reaction to the explosions began earlier -- after eight minutes and after three hours, whereas in Kazakhstan it was after four hours. Cloud lineaments did not appear over the Kazakh test site on the first space photographs after a nuclear explosion. This is possibly not because of atmospheric conditions, but because of different crustal viscosity and elasticity. A figure accompanying the text shows the propagation of disturbances along faults from the test sites. The energy of the Semipalatinsk shots is propagated over an area of 300 000 square kilometers, whereas that from the Chinese shots extends over an area of 200 000 square kilometers. It is concluded that the propagation of disturbances from nuclear explosions can be traced along faults from the dynamics of the linear cloud anomalies above the latter.
