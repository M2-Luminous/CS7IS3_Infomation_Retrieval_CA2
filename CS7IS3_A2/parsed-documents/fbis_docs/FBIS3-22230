Let me remind you that the report dealt with the deliveries and utilization in agriculture of chemicals that cause considerable ecological problems and an extremely serious deterioration in the health of the Ukrainian population. The report concluded that a new genocide, this time a chemical one, had been started against the Ukrainian people. The Procurator General's Office initiated eight criminal cases (one of them on economic matters) based on the results of the examination. It took upon itself the most involved case, which implicated officials of ministries and departments, and handed over the rest to local militia bodies. Besides, demands and proposals were submitted to the Ukrainian president and the Cabinet of Ministers. They dealt, in particular, with the need to conduct a state-sponsored ecological examination of the ``List of Those Chemical and Biological Methods of Struggle Against Pests, Plant Diseases, and Weeds, and Those Plant-Growth Regulators That Have Been Permitted for Utilization in Ukraine's Agriculture in 1992-1996'' (``List'') and suggested that the use of those preparations that raise any doubts regarding the negative consequences they may cause to human health and the environment must be temporarily suspended. It is worth recalling at this point that Ukraine's Ministry of Health authorized the Ukrainian Scientific Research Institute of Ecological Hygiene and Toxicology of Chemical Substances (UkrNDIGINTOKS) to carry out all work aimed at creating the ``List.'' This was despite the fact that this particular institution had concluded direct agreements with foreign manufacturing plants on conducting experiments involving the preparations in exchange for hard currency. This was the main reason for the malpractice committed by the institute's director M. Motuzynskyy and his deputies A. Podrushnyak and A. Bolotnyy. They were the authors of the ``List'' (other specialists of the Institute learned about its existence only during the procurator's inspection), which included highly toxic, mutagenic, carcinogenic, teratogenic, and other chemical substances. Some of the preparations had been banned in the manufacturing country, while others, such as, for example, ``harness'' [kharnes] (the United States), were not even registered, because the date for the end of testing them is May 1995. The ``List'' also includes the preparation ``tigam'' [not further identified], which was described by the former Union's State Commission in the following way: ``Highly toxic, possesses carcinogenic properties, causes dermatitis and allergic diseases...,'' or the TMTD, which is ``characterized by the harmful effect on sex organs and fetuses, may cause mutation, is teratogenic and carcinogenic, and impairs the reproductive function...,'' and other similar chemicals. In December 1993 and January 1994, the Procurator General's Office checked the state of affairs. The time was not chosen at random. The sowing campaign will soon start, and it is precisely during these months that agreements are concluded with foreign firms on deliveries of pesticides. That is why the inspection was also preventive in character. Its task was to preclude possible crimes now, rather than state the facts of their perpetration later. Unfortunately, even today, the situation does not give reason for optimism. No effective measures have been taken by the Cabinet of Ministers, Ministries of Health and Environmental Protection, or other institutions to eliminate the violations or abuse revealed by the Procurator's Office. The government commission set up last June by the directive of vice premier V. Demyanov, did not conduct the inspection properly and focused on the unjustified protection of leading officials, who violated the law (if you remember, it was precisely V. Demyanov who permitted the purchase and utilization, on 1,600,000 hectares of cornfields, of the preparation ``harness,'' which is hazardous to health). The conclusions drawn by the government commission make it possible to assert that its members do not know the true state of affairs in the branch. Their conclusions do not correspond to objective circumstances, contradict the requirements of the current legislation, and do not take into account the interests of the state and citizens. For example, the members of the commission keep referring to the use, in foreign countries, of some of the preparations in question. However, the commission does not take into account the fact that Ukraine is subjected to much contamination, including radioactive. Nor are the low level of culture in using pesticides and the extremely inefficient state control, especially over the quality of agricultural products, taken into account. Today, more than 90 percent of plant-growing products reach the consumer without being previously inspected. Such a situation prevails in all Ukrainian oblasts. Some chemicals have become global pollutants even of foodstuffs and not only of the environment. The staple foodstuffs alone were found to contain the traces of 72 types of pesticides, including those that are extremely hazardous to health: ``Dipterex, methyl parathion, DDT, phosphomile [fosfomil],'' ``copper'' and ``mercury'' compounds, and so on. Pesticides have been revealed in dairy products and even in baby food. Dairy products also contain preparations that are used for the treatment of the seed prior to sowing. Despite the alarming results of testing preparations that are imported into Ukraine, no measures are taken to at least restrict their utilization. As a matter of fact, the entire territory of Ukraine has now been transformed into a ``chemical proving ground'' for testing extremely harmful substances purchased abroad. Foreign firms ``study'' their preparations on ordinary agricultural lands, and not on experimental fields. Of course, the resulting produce is not destroyed, but is offered to the Ukrainian population for consumption. For example, the firm ``Monsanto'' (the United States) tested a mixture of chemical substances that do not even have names in Donetsk Oblast. (In the same oblast, the firm stores pesticides, the majority of which are not registered in Ukraine.) The same firm also conducted experiments in the ``Boryspilskyy'' state farm in Kiev Oblast. Similar examples may be quoted for other Ukrainian oblasts. The government commission headed by Academician Kundiyev has ``overlooked'' this and many other problems. This is very strange, since in October 1992, Yu. Kundiyev gave a negative assessment of the aforementioned ``List.'' His conclusions on the carcinogenic, mutagenic, and other hazardous properties of a number of preparations became one of the reasons for conducting the procurator's examination. All the more unfathomable are his subsequent actions both as chairman of the governmental commission and, today, as head of the commission of experts expected to prove that the preparation ``harness'' may safely be used in Ukraine's agriculture. The composition of the government commission, appointed by vice premier V. Demyanov, also suggests that its main task was, after all, to promote departmental interests. It included, first and foremost, agricultural experts and only two medical specialists: Academicians Yu. Kundiyev and Ye. Honcharuk. This is despite the fact that the inquiry by the Procurator's Office mainly raised the question of taking urgent measures to prevent the negative effect of pesticides on the health of the population. Regarding Academician Honcharuk, it was, to put it mildly, unethical to include him in the commission. The thing is that he, jointly with UkrNDIGINTOKS' director Motuzynskyy and the latter's deputy Podrushnyak, had founded a small enterprise ``Scientific Medicine.'' In December 1992, the Institute illegally transferred 1.5 million karbovantsi to the enterprise (the money was returned during the procurator's inspection). Despite such circumstances, Ye. Honcharuk, as a member of the commission, was inspecting the validity of the actions by Motuzynskyy and others. It is a great pity that the governmental commission did not want or could not see or feel the significance of the extremely alarming problem: Owing to the greed of some officials and negligence and incompetence of others, Ukrainians are in danger of becoming transformed into mutants without a hope for the future. The actions by the Cabinet of Ministers and the Ministry of Health are no more reassuring. They ignored the demands by the Procurator General's Office that the revealed violations of law be corrected. Ukraine's chief sanitary inspector V. Mariyevskyy and deputy directors of the UkrNDIGINTOKS A. Porushnyak and A. Bolotnyy have not been dismissed from their posts to this day. As regards Mr. Motuzynskyy, he feels very much in his element. He now heads a laboratory at the same Institute. Ties with foreign firms, the signing of agreements, and expert analyses have all remained in his hands. Impunity has always given rise to new violations. For example, the state association ``Ukrahrokhim'' brought considerable quantities of the preparation 2.4 D, which is not registered in Ukraine, to Khmelnytskyy, Kharkiv, and Kirovohrad oblasts. At the same time, recently appointed chairman of the State Commission for Chemistry V. Petrunek, without coordination with the Ministry of Health, is issuing permits for importing unregistered preparations: The ``Bishevskyy'' state farm (in Donetsk Oblast) received the pesticide ``MON44068'' from the firm ``Monsanto,'' and the Rivne company ``Rise'' [Raiz] -- the foreign-made preparation ``40-percent dialene'' [dialen]. It is alarming that officials of all ranks, from the minister to the head of a rayon plant-protection station, may issue permits for deliveries of foreign-made pesticides. For example, the preparation ``burex [bureks]-430FLO'' was brought into Ukraine and passed through the Customs with the help of a letter from the chief of the Holoshchanska rayon plant-protection station, and the herbicide ``aminopilek [aminopilek]-9'' -- with the help of a letter from the chief of the Rivne station. The same picture can be seen everywhere. The chemical genocide against the Ukrainian people continues. Of course, the Procurator General's Office is taking measures to protect state interests. However, the resolution of many problems is outside its jurisdiction. It is necessary, first and foremost, to resolve all problems on the basis of legislation, and this is the prerogative of the government and parliament. I will add this in conclusion: In December 1993 and January 1994, the Procurator General's Office tried to check the local court proceedings on the relevant cases. It turned out that, by that time, they had already been stopped. An examination of the materials showed that the facts had not been properly checked. Even expert analyses were not done properly. The Procurator's Office canceled the resolutions on stopping these criminal cases and united them. Kiev's Internal Affairs State Administration is currently continuing the investigation. As we can see, the law-enforcement bodies are doing everything possible to prevent the further poisoning of the country's environment and population. However, we hope that the Cabinet of Ministers, the parliament, and, in particular, candidates for the new Supreme Council, will include the ecological issue as a major issue in their programs and will, in the final analysis, be instrumental in stopping the chemical poisoning of the people.
