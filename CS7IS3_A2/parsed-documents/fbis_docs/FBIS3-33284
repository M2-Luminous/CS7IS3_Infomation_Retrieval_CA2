He highlighted the fact that "the organized private sector, the government workers, and the cooperative organizations have shown great will to collaborate. This forecasts a positive response from the other sectors of the community and, in general, demonstrates the achievements this government initiative has made." Despite the president's optimism, however, the Labor and Popular Action Union, UASP, conditioned its participation in the GAN talks to several points brought onto the scene by the Executive Branch and asked for an open agenda. The private sector says that dealing with social and economic issues at the same time is an obstacle to the talks. De Leon said that he will meet with members of CACIF [Coordinating Committee for Agriculture, Commercial, Financial and Industrial Associations] on Friday [18 February]. He will meet with cooperative organizations next week. He already has a positive response from various sectors. The president added that he has "not been able to hear the other sector's proposals because of the strike in which they are engaged. This does not mean there has not been a generally positive response." The president concluded by expressing optimism. He believes the country will attain the goal of governability, which will allow us to set the foundation for social structure changes later on, "which is why the government will sign the agreements and abide by them."
