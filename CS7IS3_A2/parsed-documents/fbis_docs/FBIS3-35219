We, the signers of the pledge and accord document, thank God for having helped our people, represented by political forces in and out of power, to choose the correct way to complete the accord document through democratic, serious, and responsible dialogue with a view to putting a definitive end to the crisis, reinforcing unity, democracy, and stabilizing the state of law and order and institutions as a practcial way to achieve devleopment and contribute to the civilized Arabic and Islamic agenda. The signing of the pledge and accord document in Amman, the capital of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, will put a definitive end to all complications. It will expedite the end of the crisis. It will slice through the roots of the crisis and contribute much to the implementation of the contents of the document, so as to restore security and stability to the dear Yemeni homeland. By signing the pledge and accord document in brotherly Jordan, we have added faith to our Yemeni document, confirming the nation's ability to take the initiative to resolve national problems and crises, restablish close Arab links, and revive hope in an era of division that has intensified to the point of enmity between brother and brother. We, the Yemenis, have suffered from much political trouble in our contemporary history. The result is an unshakable faith in unity as the answer and the way to build our modern state on foundations of democracy, social justice, equality, and human rights. Unity is a historic step on the road to our comprehensive Arab and Islamic unity. Local, Arab, and world conditions that coincided with the establishment of our unity not only had a negative impact on our unionist, democratic project, but included all the remnants of the division era -- remnants that were not taken into account during and after the Gulf war. As a result, our steps in our drive to build the new modern state have faltered. We should have been working hard to firm up the foundation of unity and to reinforce its democratic course, to open the door to the prosperity of the homeland and the well-being of the people. Our people have proved to the world that they have enough strength and wisdom to ride out the crises that obstruct their march, subordinating impulse to reason and narrow interests to the call of conscience. Our people have borne numerous difficulties. Much negativism has affected various aspects of their lives. Yet, the historic experience of Yemen proves that the will of the people has triumphed. Only democratic dialogue will be able to realize the unity and stability of the homeland and survive crises, no matter how delicate or complex the situation may be. Only through democratic and peaceful dialogue can we start on the correct road out of the crisis and toward serious action to attain all that our people and brothers and friends around the world want. We emphasize that Yemen will remain united, now that we have worked out its present and future outlines and laid the foundations for its stability and advancement and affluence, drawing succor and success from God and resolve and steadfastness from our people. In these awesome and historic moments, we declare our determination to abide by the accord document and the sincere commitment of our political parties and organizations to turn it into a practical program for our new march as one team. We will confront anyone who tries to block its implementation. We will abide by all guarantees and implement everything we agreed on, in accordance with the timetables specified in the document. We would like to emphasize that the progress and well-being of peoples are contingent upon the strength of institutions and the principles and the clarity of vision and methods. We hereby promise our great Yemeni people to make the Dialogue Commitee, the political parties and organizations, along with all well-meaning Yemenis, a potent force to advance the implementation of the pledge and accord document. On this occasion and in this favored month, we take the opportunity to extend our deep thanks to His Majesty King Husayn of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and to the Jordanian government and people for their distinguished efforts on behalf of Yemen's unity. We thank them for their sponsorship of this blessed, historic meeting. We thank those who have expressed their concern and exerted themselves so we, the Yemenis, might come safely through the crisis. Our thanks go to all those who have shared our accord signing ceremonies. In conclusion, we thank our patient Yemeni people for their patience and endurance and for helping us lift ourselves from the crisis in the homeland and the people. We congratulate our Arab and Islamic nation on the occasion of the blessed month of Ramadan. We ask God that next year's Ramadan will see us all enjoying the fruits of security and stability. We thank God and seek his succor and help.
