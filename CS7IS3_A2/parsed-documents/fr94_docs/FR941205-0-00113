FR941205-0-00113 FR941205-0-00026 Melicope ovalis has been found only on the island of Maui on the eastern and southeastern slopes of Haleakala. There is one known extant population, located in Kipahulu Valley in Haleakala National Park. This species typically grows in koa- and 'ohi'a-dominated Montane Wet Forests at elevations between 850 and 1,430 m (2,800 and 4,700 ft). Associated taxa include Broussaisia arguta (kanawao), Cheirodendron trigynum ('olapa), and Perrottetia sandwicensis (olomea). Major threats are habitat degradation and damage to plants by feral pigs and reduced reproductive vigor and/or extinction from stochastic events due to the existence of only one population and one known individual. Competition with alien introduced plants such as Hilo grass and strawberry guava, susceptibility to black twig borer, and habitat degradation and damage to plants by feral goats and axis deer are potential threats (HHP 1992e, 1992f; L. Cuddihy and A. Medeiros, pers. comms., 1992). Previous Federal Action Federal action on these plants began as a result of section 12 of the Act, which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to prepare a report on plants considered to be endangered, threatened, or extinct in the United States. This report, designated as House Document No. 94&hyph;51, was presented to Congress on January 9, 1975. In that document, Melicope balloui (as Pelea balloui ) and M. ovalis (as P. ovalis ) were considered to be endangered. On July 1, 1975, the Service published a notice in the Federal Register (40 FR 27823) of its acceptance of the Smithsonian report as a petition within the context of section 4(c)(2) (now section 4(b)(3)) of the Act, and giving notice of its intention to review the status of the plant taxa named therein. As a result of that review, on June 16, 1976, the Service published a proposed rule in the Federal Register (41 FR 24523) to determine endangered status pursuant to section 4 of the Act for approximately 1,700 vascular plant species, including M. balloui (as P. balloui ) and M. ovalis (as P. ovalis ). The list of 1,700 plant taxa was assembled on the basis of comments and data received by the Smithsonian Institution and the Service in response to House Document No. 94&hyph;51 and the July 1, 1975, Federal Register publication. General comments received in response to the 1976 proposal are summarized in an April 26, 1978, Federal Register publication (43 FR 17909). In 1978, amendments to the Act required that all proposals over 2 years old be withdrawn. A 1-year grace period was given to proposals already over 2 years old. On December 10, 1979, the Service published a notice in the Federal Register (44 FR 70796) withdrawing the portion of the June 16, 1976, proposal that had not been made final, along with four other proposals that had expired. The Service published an updated notice of review for plants on December 15, 1980 (45 FR 82479), in which M. balloui (as P. balloui ) and M. ovalis (as P. ovalis ) were considered to be Category 1 candidates for Federal listing. Category 1 species are those for which the Service has on file substantial information on biological vulnerability and threats to support preparation of listing proposals. In an updated notice of review published on September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39525), M. balloui (as P. balloui ) was considered to be a Category 1 species, and M. ovalis (as P. ovalis ) a Category 1* species. Category 1* taxa are those that are possibly extinct. In a notice of review published February 21, 1990 (55 FR 6183), M. adscendens was treated as a Category 3A species and M. balloui and M. ovalis as Category 1* species. Category 3A species are those for which the Service has persuasive evidence of extinction. Because specimens collected in the past few years were recently verified as being these three species, they are confirmed extant and are being listed as endangered. For petitions presenting substantial information that listing may be warranted, section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to make a finding on whether the petitioned action is warranted within 12 months of receipt of the petition. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 amendments further requires all petitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated as having been newly submitted on that date. On October 13, 1983, the Service found that the petitioned listing of these species was warranted but precluded by other pending listing actions, in accordance with section 4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act. Notification of this finding was published in the Federal Register on January 20, 1984 (49 FR 2485). Such a finding requires the petition to be recycled pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act. The finding was reviewed in October of 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991. Publication of the proposed rule constituted the final one-year finding for these species. On May 11, 1993, the Service published in the Federal Register (58 FR 18073) a proposal to list the plants Melicope adscendens, M. balloui, and M. ovalis as endangered. This proposal was based primarily on information supplied by the Hawaii Heritage Program and observations by botanists and naturalists. The Service now determines these three species of Melicope to be endangered with the publication of this rule. Summary of Comments and Recommendations In the May 11, 1993, proposed rule and associated notifications, all interested parties were requested to submit factual reports or information that might contribute to the development of a final listing decision. The public comment period ended July 12, 1993. Appropriate State agencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations, and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. A newspaper notice inviting public comment was published in ``The Honolulu Advertiser'' on June 2, 1993, and ``The Maui News'' on June 1, 1993. No letters of comment were received.
