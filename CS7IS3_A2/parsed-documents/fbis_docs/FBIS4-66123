Regarding the bombing by the mafia in Piana degli Albanesi, which saw the destruction of a home of a Left Democrat party official, Maroni replied how he immediately went in person to Sicily where he met with seventeen mayors and numerous city councilors and private citizens. "The new and effective concept" the interior minister told the Senate, "is the that fight against organized crime will now take place through local governments which side against the mafia phenomenon and are no longer, as once was the case, in support of the mafia." Turning his attention to Saturday's [14 May] march in Vicenza, Maroni ruled out any fault for the part of National Police Chief Vincenzo Parisi and argued that "the ministry official, in Rome, who received the request from authorities in Vicenza for 80 additional police officers probably did not notify Parisi because he underestimated the request." The interior minister then went on to say how the participants in the demonstration had all been identified, thanks to television tapes, and their names forwarded to judicial authorities for violation of laws against fascism. Maroni also told the senate how the number of skinheads in Italy was 800, of which 300 were considered "activists."
