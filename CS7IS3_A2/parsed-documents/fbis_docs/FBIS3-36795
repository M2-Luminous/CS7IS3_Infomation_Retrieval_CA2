The first issue on the agenda was the law on firearms. This draft law was submitted by the Judicial Commission and was introduced to deputies by Givi Lominadze [the chairman of the Provisional Committee for Emergencies in western Georgia]. There is also an alternative draft prepared by the Law and Order Commission. Members of parliament are unanimous that it is very important for the country to adopt a firearms law. However, the process has been going on for quite a long time. Before discussing the agenda, parliament started a debate on MP Vazha Otarashvili's proposal on the handover to parliament of the construction of the Cabinet of Ministers. Some members of parliament even called this proposal provocative. It was noted that issues like this could not be decided so simply. There were quite a few ethical and technical difficulties. It was also necessary to take into account the Cabinet of Ministers' opinion about the issue. In examining the draft law on firearms, deputies mainly debated articles of the law relating to arms manufacturing and trade. Some deputies were in favor of a state monopoly on both, the manufacturing and trade. There was also the different view that supported the issue of licences to the private sector to conduct both these activities. In the opinion of Givi Lominadze, one of the members of the judicial commission, the private sector should be allowed to manufacture arms, while only the state could trade in arms. [passage omitted] After a break, parliament continued work. However, voting on the issue was postponed because of Deputy Speaker Vakhtang Rcheulishvili's announcement that Abkhazians had attacked villages in Gali Rayon. Civilians, including women, children and the elderly had fled to the woods for shelter. The Georgian Parliament decided to prepare an appeal to be sent to the United Nations, Russia, and the other countries that are playing the role of peace guarantors in Abkhazia.
