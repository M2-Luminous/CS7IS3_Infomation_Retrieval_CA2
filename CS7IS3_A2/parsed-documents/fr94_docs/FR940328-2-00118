FR940328-2-00118 FR940328-2-00066 Applicable Regulations: (a) The Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) in 34 CFR parts 74, 75, 77, 79, 82, 85, and 86; and (b) the Strengthening Institutions Program Regulations, 34 CFR part 607. Supplementary Information: On September 16, 1993, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for this program in the Federal Register (58 FR 48478). It is not the policy of the Department of Education to solicit applications before the publication of final regulations. However, in this case, it is necessary to solicit applications on the basis of the NPRM, with the modifications described below, to be able to implement section 314(c) of the HEA. That section requires the Secretary to notify an applicant by June 30, 1994 of (1) the score given the applicant by a panel of reviewers, (2) the recommendation of the panel with regard to such application, and (3) the Secretary's reasons for funding or not funding an application, and any modification in a panel recommendation with regard to an application. Anticipated Changes to the NPRM Since the publication of the NPRM, Congress enacted the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;208. One of those technical amendments revised section 313(b) of the HEA. Prior to its amendment, section 313(b) of the HEA provided that ``In awarding grants under this part, the Secretary shall give priority to applicants who are not already receiving a grant under this part.'' The Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993 added the following exception to that section: ``Except that a grant made under section 354(a)(1) shall not be considered a grant under this part.'' (Section 354(a)(1) authorizes the Secretary to fund ``cooperative arrangement'' grants.) In proposed ยง607.13, the Secretary had provided that an institution could not apply for both an individual development grant and a cooperative arrangement grant. However, as a result of the amendment to section 313(b), that limitation has been eliminated and an applicant may apply for both types of grants. In addition, as a result of the amendment to section 313(b) of the HEA, a recipient of a cooperative arrangement grant does not fall into a lower funding priority, and ยง607.20(b) will be amended accordingly. The Secretary anticipates making the following two additional changes in the NPRM. If these changes are not ultimately made, applicants will be given the opportunity to revise their applications as necessary. Under the first anticipated change, in ยง607.11, an applicant must justify its failure to complete activities funded under a previous grant regardless of whether the applicant is requesting additional grant funds to complete those activities. In the NPRM, an applicant had to justify its failure to complete funded activities only if it was requesting additional grant funds to complete those activities. Under the second anticipated change, under ยง607.10, an applicant may choose a ``Dean'' to be a project coordinator or activity director under a grant and may use grant funds to pay the salary of that individual as long as that ``Dean'' does not report directly to the President of the applicant institution and does not have college-wide administrative authority and responsibility.
