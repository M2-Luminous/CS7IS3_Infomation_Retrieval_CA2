His main objective will be to clear up the rules for trading between Russia and Finland. Kaariainen thinks that the rules need to be revised with regard to fiscal issues, including the recent unexpected road-toll problems. "We hope, of course, that the Russians will come up with solutions to these problems as quickly as possible, and I have no reason to doubt their goodwill in this respect. But we also have to be realistic with regard to the timetable," Kaariainen said. Kaariainen will carry out an initial review of his objectives with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Economic Relations Minister Oleg Davydov, Kaariainen's opposite number as head of the Russian delegation to the economic commission, while Kaariainen leads the Finnish one. Today's meeting between the two chairmen will be brief and formal, but it has been long expected. The work of the economic commission has been at a standstill for more than a year due to the inability of the Russians to appoint a chairman for their delegation. Following Davidov's appointment to the chairmanship it is now believed that the economic commission will be able to resume its work. One of the objectives of the meeting between the chairmen will be to prepare the commission's next session. "The most essential thing, of course, is that the two chairmen of the commission are now able to meet after a long pause. This shows that there is a will on the part of the politicians and authorities in both countries to stimulate the expanding trade," Kaariainen added. Kaariainen's positive expectations are also understandable considering that today's meeting can be held in spite of Davidov's various other commitments. It was still uncertain on Monday [25 April] morning whether Davidov would be home in time for Thursday after his long foreign tour. The official agenda of the chairmens' meeting includes topics such as financing trade and transportation plus the specific company projects discussed during Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin's trip to Finland in March. "I am now going to review progress on these specific issues," Kaariainen said. The topics discussed during Chernomyrdin's visit included projects put forward by Metra, Outokumpu, and Rautaruukki. Kaariainen's visit to Moscow will not, however, involve anybody from these or any other enterprises. TT [expansion unknown] President Georg Ehrnroth will perform the function of joint chairman representing these companies. The chairmen are also expected to fix a date for the commission's next meeting, to be held in Helsinki. Kaariainen thinks that it may take place before midsummer.
