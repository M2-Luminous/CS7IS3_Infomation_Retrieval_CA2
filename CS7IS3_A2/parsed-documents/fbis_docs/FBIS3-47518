Kunadze is no stranger to Han as the two have met several times as researcher and professor at academic conferences while the former was serving at the IMEMO (Institute of World Economy and International Relations). He expressed a hope to learn the Korean language during talks with Minister Han, according to a ministry official who was present at the meeting. Majoring in Japanese at Moscow University, Kunadze is a fluent Japanese speaker. The Russian envoy was quoted as saying that his government plans to send more diplomats to Seoul, adding that the Russian embassy is a little small. Touching on his official residence south of Mt. Namsan, he also said that the house is good as living quarters but small for social functions, as if suggesting early settlement of the ownership of the former Russian legation site in downtown Seoul, according to the ministry official. Former ambassador Alexander Panov has started working as vice foreign minister in charge of Asia-Pacific affairs covering Korea, China, Southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand, Kunadze was quoted as saying. While serving as vice minister, Kunadze was responsible for personnel and administration affairs in addition to Asia-Pacific and southwest Asian affairs. He also met with Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong for about 35 minutes. Vice Minister Hong had served as ambassador to Moscow for one year before he became vice minister last March. He is expected to present the letter of credentials to President Kim late this month or early next month along with three other new ambassadors, the ministry official said.
