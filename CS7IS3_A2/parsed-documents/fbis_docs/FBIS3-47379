What is important in effecting a new revolutionary upsurge in all sectors of socialist construction in hearty response to the New Year address of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is that all the officials, party members and working people make continued innovations and uninterrupted progress in the spirit of Chollima spurred on by the "speed of the '90s," the editorial says, and continues: To make continued innovations and uninterrupted progress in the spirit of Chollima spurred on by the "speed of the '90s" -- this is an important militant slogan set by the Workers' Party of Korea. The party set the next three years as a period of adjustment and put forward militant tasks to secure a new base for reaching higher levels of socialism by implementing its revolutionary economic strategy. Each time they were faced with difficult and vast tasks in socialist construction, our people recorded the history of socialist construction with heroic feats, closely united around the party. In the postwar period when everything was destroyed and no bricks were left unbroken, our people brought about a great upswing of Chollima, producing what was lacking and finding out what was insufficient in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle in reliance on themselves. In this way, they successfully built a socialist power independent, self-sufficient and self- reliant in national defence. The spirit of Chollima spurred on by the "speed of the '90s" is a new speed of progress in socialist construction with the spirit of Chollima in the postwar period plus the revolutionary zeal and indomitable fighting spirit in the '90s. This reflects the noble intention and unshakable will of our party to make the first year of the period of adjustment an occasion of a great advance in socialist construction by successfully inheriting the tradition of the great upswing of our revolution.
