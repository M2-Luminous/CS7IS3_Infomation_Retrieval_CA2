He explained that this undertaking will "not undermine the implementation of Mercosur [Co]on Market of the South]," although he did express his doubts about Mercosur joining NAFTA. "I envision a favorable disposition on the part of the Argentine Government," said Amorim. His words were reconfirmed by Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella, who said that "although it is still premature to issue an opinion in this regard, Argentina will not have any objections to the Brazilian proposal because we do not want Mercosur to be a closed bloc." [Boragni] What is the extent of ALCSA? [Amorim] The idea is to have a full free trade zone for a 10-year period similar to GATT; that is, an area that will encompass 80 percent of regional trade and will not be detrimental to the participation of Mercosur member countries in other free trade blocs. I am specifically referring to other regional agreements such as ALADI [Latin American Integration Association] and the Andean Pact, for example. [Boragni] What mechanism will be used to implement this initiative? [Amorim] This is still being discussed by the four signatories of the Asuncion Treaty. Brazil does not uphold a rigid proposal, otherwise we would not have come to Buenos Aires to discuss it with our partners. We are waiting for a counterproposal. [Boragni] What do you think will be the impact on Argentine-Brazilian trade? [Amorim] Bilateral trade will not be affected at all. On the contrary, Brazilian-Argentine trade ties with other South American countries will increase. What is important here is that if ALCSA is approved, commercial trade with all countries will increase. [Boragni] Has the Argentine economic team been consulted on the issue? [Amorim] Yes, and I saw a very favorable disposition. I see no doubts about the agreement's objective. [Boragni] Is this Brazilian proposal a no to NAFTA and Mercosur? [Amorim] Quite the contrary. Mercosur continues to be our top priority, including that pertaining to free trade and the definition of a common customs tariff (AEC). At any rate I must stress that for Brazil, the Mercosur proposal cannot be excluded. [Boragni] What is Brazil's position regarding Mercosur joining NAFTA? [Amorim] I believe this is something that does not depend on us. The United States will surely indicate with whom it wishes to negotiate. If Brazil is accepted, we will be willing to join NAFTA. And if Argentina is invited to negotiate, we will have to see how to make it compatible with our commitments with Mercosur. I believe it is not technically easy to join NAFTA but it surely is possible. [Boragni] Brazil has just launched an economic plan. Does your government foresee a greater economic recovery? [Amorim] The big problem affecting the Brazilian economy is inflation. In spite of it, however, in 1993, Brazil experienced an economic growth ranging between 5 and 6 percent. The automobile industry achieved a record production. But the main objective of Finance Minister Cardoso's economic plan is to achieve economic growth under stable conditions. I believe that both the business sector and the people have had a very positive reaction.
