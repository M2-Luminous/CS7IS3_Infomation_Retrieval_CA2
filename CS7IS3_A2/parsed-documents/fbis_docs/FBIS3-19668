At the conclusion of his two-day visit to Bonn, Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' said that his country has a "real will for a lasting and comprehensive peace." At the same time, however, he rejected "partial negotiations" with Israel. After the Hebron massacre, the international community now must exert pressure on Israel, which, in Syria's view is not "seriously" interested in a "just peace." He fears that, with its policy of two-sided negotiations with its neighbors, Israel just wants to divide the Arab camp, al-Shar' said. "Partial solutions" would not bring about peace but, perhaps, even worsen the situation. Thus, the agreement between Israel and the PLO did not bring peace, but only encouraged extremists. The bloodbath of Hebron was the "consequence of this agreement." With this position al-Shar' contradicted the view of his host, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of Germany), who had called the agreement a first step toward a "constructive prospect for a lasting reconciliation." Despite his rejection of partial negotiations with Israel, in talking to journalists al-Shar' evaded the question of whether and under which conditions Syria would be ready or resume direct talks with Israel. He repeated the demand for a complete withdrawal of the settlers and a complete return of the occupied territories. Diplomatic circles in Bonn noted positively that the Syrian minister accused "extremists from both sides" -- and not just Israel alone -- of endangering the peace process. Syria is interested in more intensive relations with the European Union. Kinkel promised to advocate a meeting of the European-Syrian Cooperation Council at the end of the year. Reportedly, he urged his guest for an extradition agreement with the FRG. According to intelligence service findings, German terrorist and Carlos associate Weinrich has found refuge in Syria. Syria's government denies this.
