FR940830-1-00087 FR940830-1-00014 Specific Waste Handling Practices for Vessels During Transport Proposed ยง237.5 provides a standard for waste handling practices for vessels during transport of municipal or commercial waste in coastal waters. This standard requires that the owner or operator ensure that the deposit of waste into coastal waters from a vessel is minimized. For example, open hopper barges transporting municipal solid waste could comply by covering the entire open area of the hopper barge with a net suitable for minimizing waste deposits into coastal waters during transport. In addition to meeting this standard, all vessels requiring a SPA permit will be required to submit an Operation and Maintenance manual to the appropriate USCG office with their permit application. The permittee or applicant should call the USCG NRC to obtain the address of the appropriate USCG office for the area in which the vessel will operate. The owners or operators of vessels which have already obtained a conditional permit under the USCG interim permitting rule (33 CFR Part 151) would be required to submit an Operation and Maintenance manual within 180 days of the effective date of the rule. Owners and operators of vessels not yet permitted would need to submit an Operation and Maintenance manual at the time they submit a permit application to the USCG. Operation and Maintenance manual requirements for vessels are similar to those proposed for waste sources and receiving facilities discussed above. EPA considered requiring vessel owners and operators to submit to the USCG a letter certifying the development of the Operation and Maintenance manual rather than the manual itself; however, EPA decided that because vessels are required to submit an application for a permit it is logical to include a copy of their manual. Submission of the manual with the permit application ensures that the permit applicant has fully considered these waste handling practices, cleanup measures, record keeping, and reporting requirements and has documented them accordingly. Guidance for development of a vessel Operation and Maintenance manual is found in Appendix A of this proposal. Failure to develop an Operation and Maintenance manual is a violation of SPA and these regulations. EPA is proposing that the owner or operator of a vessel subject to this regulation must secure the waste to ensure that deposit in coastal waters is minimized. In particular, vessels must not be loaded in excess of their design capacity or in a manner inconsistent with the vessel's Operation and Maintenance manual. Loading of a vessel in excess of its capacity would clearly pose risks of waste deposition in coastal waters. In addition, the proposal contains a provision which would require vessels to have and use a drainage containment system. Such a system will reduce the amount of leachate discharge into coastal waters. EPA is also proposing that all ports and valves which may be used for flushing or discharging waste residue from the hull or tanks must be labelled and valve seals shall be placed on the valves. This requirement would ensure that waste handling personnel would easily be able to control the movement of leachate and waste on the vessel. The Agency is proposing that owners or operators of vessels remove all municipal or commercial waste deposited into coastal waters during transport, or, when appropriate, during the waste transfer. This proposal also would require the vessels to have the capability on board to clean up the waste deposited or to call a support unit to clean up the waste deposited. In addition, as EPA proposed for waste sources and receiving facilities, the proposal would require vessels to have a placard located on board which is readily visible to persons involved in waste handling practices. The placard would have to display the name and telephone number of the individual responsible for notifying the USCG NRC of a deposit of waste in coastal waters that is beyond their capacity to clean up. Finally, the proposal would require vessel owners or operators to maintain records of municipal or commercial waste deposited in coastal waters. The records are to include information on the date and time of day the deposit occurred; the type of waste deposited; the estimated amount and type of waste recovered; and the name of the vessel from which the deposit occurred. Section 4103(b)(2) authorizes EPA to include record keeping requirements in the regulations, and the Agency believes that such requirements are reasonable, and will encourage proper handling of waste so that deposits into U.S. coastal waters do not occur. Similar requirements have been proposed for the owners and operators of waste sources and receiving facilities. As with waste handling practices proposed for waste sources and receiving facilities, EPA considered alternatives to regulating these vessels, such as specific procedures and equipment required on board a vessel. Because of the variability in nature of municipal and commercial waste transported, in addition to the variety of vessels, waste sources and receiving facilities affected by this rule, EPA chose to propose a waste handling practice standard alternative today that is flexible yet sufficient to carry out the goals of the statute. Tracking System Section 4103(b)(3) of SPA allows for tracking systems to be required if the Administrator determines that tracking systems will be necessary to assure adequate enforcement of the requirements in SPA and these regulations. EPA, in consultation with the USCG, conducted a study on the need for tracking systems for vessels transporting municipal and commercial waste. The results of this study are documented in a Report to Congress submitted by EPA in August of 1992, titled ``The Need for Tracking Systems on Vessels Transporting Municipal or Commercial Wastes.'' EPA is proposing to follow the recommendation outlined in that report and require a tracking system in the future only if deemed necessary by the Administrator (on a case-by-case basis). EPA is proposing in ยง237.6 today that a tracking system may be required for owners and operators of waste sources, vessels, and receiving facilities which have been identified as persistent violators. In determining whether to require a tracking system, EPA is proposing that the Administrator consider the following variables: (1) The owner's and operator's history of compliance with SPA; (2) the owner's and operator's history of compliance with other environmental statutes; (3) the characteristics and amounts of waste transported; and (4) the feasibility of installing a specific kind of tracking system.
