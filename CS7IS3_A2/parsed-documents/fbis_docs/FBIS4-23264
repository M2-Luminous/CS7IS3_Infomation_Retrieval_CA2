FBIS4-23264 "drafr106_e_94003" FBIS-AFR-94-106 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 WEST AFRICA Nigeria Antigovernment Demonstrations Occur in Lagos Antigovernment Demonstrations Occur in Lagos AB0106162394 Paris AFP in English 1524 GMT 1 Jun 94 AB0106162394 Paris AFP English BFN [By Jacques Pinto] [Text] Lagos, June 1 (AFP) -- Anti-government demonstrators took to the streets on the outskirts of Lagos on Wednesday [1 June] a day after an ultimatum from pro-democracy groups to Nigeria's junta to stand down expired, an opposition spokesman said. An official in the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights told AFP that protestors had put up barricades in northern suburbs and also blockaded roads leading out of Nigeria's economic capital to the east and to the west. Eyewitnesses confirmed that protestors had put up roadblocks and set tyres on fire in Abule Egba, some 50 kilometres (30 miles) outside the centre of the sprawling metropolis. The rights committee spokesman said the demonstrations began the morning after a deadline given by the National Democratic Campaign (NADECO) to the regime of General Sani Abacha to stand down expired at midnight Tuesday. The protests in the suburbs were "a symbolic action in support of the NADECO agenda and to register their (the people's) displeasure against continued military rule," the spokesman said, asking not to be named. National radio began broadcasts Wednesday with a warning to NADECO from police chief Ibrahim Coomassie that a ban on political activity and public gatherings remained in force. The police chief called on "all genuine advocates" of democracy to take part in a national constitutional conference the regime plans to organise from June 27 as a key point of its programme to restore elected civilian rule. Any other political programmes would be considered "illegal," Coommassie warned. The NADECO, which comprises many prominent Nigerians, including former government ministers and state governors, retired military figures and rights activists, has dismissed the planned conference as a ruse by the military to hold on to power. It called on Abacha, who seized power last November and scrapped all Nigeria's democratic institutions, to go by midnight on March 31 [as received] and hand over to Moshood Abiola, held millionaire businessman held on unofficial results comfortably to have won a presidential election. That poll, held on June 12 last year, was billed free and fair by international observers but annulled by then military ruler General Ibrahim Babangida, who alleged irregularities. Two months later, Babangida stepped down, installing an unelected civilian adminstration, which Abacha ousted. Abiola on Tuesday told journalists at his Lagos home that "if NADECO calls on me to form a government, I will form a government." "Abacha is a goner," he said. The military administrator of Lagos State, Colonel Olagunsoye Oyinlola, for his part warned that police had been put on alert to prevent any breaches of the peace. The annulment of the poll last year led to bloody demonstrations in several parts of Lagos. Residents of some city districts continued Wednesday to stock up on food, hiking the prices of basics such as rice, for fear of trouble. Abiola, a Moslem from the Yoruba ethnic group with support notably in southwest Nigeria, said he had contacted a number of leading Nigerians with a view to forming a national unity government. Africa's most populous nation, with some 88 million people, has many ethnic groups, of which the largest are the Yorubas and Ibos of the mainly Christian south and the Hausa-Fulani of the predominantly Moslem north.
