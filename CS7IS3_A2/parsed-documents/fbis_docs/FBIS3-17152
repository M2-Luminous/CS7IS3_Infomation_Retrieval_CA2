Novruz is the spring festival. We have begun to mark this occasion after many years. It indicates significant developments in the world. Azerbaijan's people have achieved their freedom.

[passage on Aliyev's reference to the importance of women and mothers and Azerbaijanis living abroad omitted] Azerbaijan has many important problems. However, the most important of all is to create the conditions required to end the war, maintain Azerbaijan's territorial integrity, establish peace and tranquillity for the people, and enable each and every citizen to benefit from the gains of our freedom and independence. We regard those objectives as an obligation that we have tried to fulfill and we will continue to do so. The most urgent task is to end the war and maintain Azerbaijan's independence. Our problems are common knowledge. We are trying to [words indistinct]. The initiatives we have made in that direction are common knowledge. The Armenian Armed Forces must withdraw from the occupied territories. They must be removed from Azerbaijan's territory and Azerbaijan's territorial integrity must be maintained. We are holding talks on the basis of those principles. We shall maintain the talks. The negotiations will be held on the basis of the maintenance of Azerbaijan's independence and its territorial integrity. I hope that something will be achieved.
