After describing as surprising the frivolity with which representatives of certain parliamentary parties made such assertions, which are, quote, offensive to the head of the state as they lack any real foundation, unquote, the communique argues -- using as evidence the transcription of the magnetic tape recording of Ion Iliescu's statements during his visit to Satu Mare in connection with nationalized housing -- that every time Romania's president expressed his stance, he actually never did anything but insist that the Constitution and laws of the country need to be observed in such a controversial issue. Besides, the aforementioned stances were expressed because of the citizens' numerous grievances and complaints. They had been cruelly dislodged from their residences on the basis of court rulings, ignoring the law that stipulates that currently valid rental contracts are automatically prolonged for the next five years, until the legal status of nationalized housing is regulated by law. As a consequence of all this, states the presidential spokesman's communique, there is nothing the president can retract from the things he said during the meeting in the Satu Mare County Prefect's office, in reply to a question he had been asked. The communique concludes by saying that, quote, if that answer, its context, and spirit are examined honestly, it becomes obvious that those things asserted by the president fully comply with the Constitution and with his resonsibilities as guarantor of the observance of the Constitution's stipulations, unquote.
