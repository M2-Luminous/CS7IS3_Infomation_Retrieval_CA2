When Japan annexed Korea in 1910 and ruled the country until 1945, Korean independence fighters set up a government-in-exile in Shanghai, China. They later moved it to Chongqing along with the Chinese nationalist party, when the Japanese invaded China. "Seoul and Beijing agreed to restore the building of the Korean provisional government in Chongqing last December and the restoration work will begin in the first half of this year and will be completed by Aug. 15 next year," the official said. Aug. 15 is the day when Korea gained independence from Japan in 1945 at the end of the World War II. "The area near the site of the Korean provisional government in Chongqing is to be demolished for land development, but Seoul and Beijing have agreed to restore the building of the Korean provisional government. Seoul will invest 1.3 million U.S. dollars for it and Beijing will chip in 2 million dollars," he said. The premises will include two four-story structures and two two-story buildings with an aggregate floor space of 1,712 square meters.
