Their leaders have assumed similar stands in connection with Professor Berov's illness and the ensuing results for the government. They claim that it is a question of the prime minister's personal decision whether he wishes to remain in his post or resign, whether he should choose between his health and a political career. According to the aforementioned leaders, it is the same whether the prime minister should go to Brussels for a week or whether he should go for treatment to the government officials' clinic at the Military Hospital. The unanimity is not surprising; it only confirms the prevailing conviction that the NSD is an offspring of the BSP. The only reason for surprise is the lightheartedness with which both political organizations are treating issues of crucial importance for our country. After one week abroad, Mr. Berov is supposed to resume the prime minister's seat and continue chairing the government (although with rather doubtful chances of success, as a matter of fact) and to bear the responsibility for the country, according to Article 108, paragraph 2, of the Constitution. After several weeks in the hospital, the prime minister is expected to undergo a few months of rehabilitation treatment in a special clinic or at home. Throughout all this time, he is neither subjectively nor objectively in a position to bear the responsibility for the government. This would be the time of missing responsibility, which is so convenient for the destructive intentions of Balkan and Bulgarian communism and its satellites. It is naive to believe and cynical to claim that an individual who has suffered a severe heart attack, who has undergone surgery including four bypasses, and who is 70 years old could once more assume the fully fledged leadership of the state, especially considering his "achievements" at a time when he was in good health. Good intentions and personal ambitions should give in to the laws of human physiology. The commentaries about Prof. Berov's illness are frequently lacking in objectivity, under the influence of emotions. We are all mortal. It is an understandable human reaction to feel sympathy for those who are suffering from ill health. Nevertheless, when Bulgaria's vital interests are at stake, truth should prevail over courtesy. We should have the courage to tell the truth in a spirit of tolerance and to bear it with stoicism. For objective medical reasons, Prof. Berov is no longer in a position to preside over the Bulgarian Government, especially considering the difficult period that our country is going through. An incapacitated prime minister with two deputy prime ministers, who are notorious offsprings of "mature socialism" in command, means to further accelerate the pace of recommunization, which is already under way in our country, to an unprecedented extent. Prof. Berov's remaining in his post, and even a delay of his resignation, would be detrimental to his health and a disaster for Bulgaria. The prime minister's resignation, and hence the resignation of his cabinet, is not a matter of personal choice but an absolute necessity for the preservation of our national interests. Let us hope that Prof. Berov, whom, as I am convinced, we all wish a prompt recovery, will come to a decision that should be worthy of himself and would make things easier for Bulgaria.
