The MENA report, citing the Paris weekly "L'EVENEMENT DE JEUDI," said that the United States, backed by Britain, still thinks it premature to lift the international embargo against Iraq, which was imposed after Iraq's August 1990 invasion of Kuwait. However, the weekly said that France, backed by Russia and China, stands for lifting the sanctions. MENA said that the change in the French stand came slowly after much hesitation. Currently, French companies are preparing to secure the lion's share in Iraqi contracts after American companies clinched two big contracts in Saudi Arabia, the weekly said. The economic incentives might have been the reason that prompted Paris to accelerate its steps toward lifting the embargo on Iraq, it added. According to MENA, two events have shown the improvement in France's position on Iraq. The first one was an announcement by the French Government to terminate its participation in monitoring the embargo, and the second is the tendency to open a section to look after the French interests in Iraq. "The Iraqis believe that the change in France's stand is a positive step toward better bilateral relations, and they are awaiting more to come in the coming few weeks," the news agency said.
