Propagandists have sought to portray our party as intransigent, unreasonable and constantly shifting the goalposts. Sadly, those making such claims are strangers to the truth and are gambling with our country's future. The facts are as follows: The IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] has always negotiated on the basis of written documentation -- from Codesa [Convention for a Democratic South Africa] on. Unfortunately, our eminently reasonable submissions were totally ignored at the Kempton Park talks. We walked out in protest on 2 July 1993. We then engaged in bilateral and trilateral negotiations with the Government and ANC [African National Congress] and have continued to do so. Our final proposals were contained in a document of 19 December 1993, known as the "yellow paper" which incorporated our proposed constitutional amendments placed on the Order Paper of Parliament. Far from shifting the goalposts, we have in fact constantly reduced our demands. No proposal over and above those contained in the yellow paper have been advanced. Our negotiators have shown flexibility, departing from principles and positions in the yellow paper. This is particularly the case with regard to the powers of provinces, their fiscal autonomy, the role of the Senate, provisions of rationalisation, the deadlock-breaking mechanisms, matters relating to provincial civil services and police, the functions of local government and more besides. The National Party could not sell these reasonable proposals to its partners in the ANC/SACP [South African Communist Party] alliance, with whom it had struck a deal. Indeed, negotiations broke down on a clear and cynical ultimatum tabled by SACP chairman, Mr Joe Slovo. He said the IFP and the Freedom Alliance had to accept two conditions, or further negotiations would be futile. These were: - that provinces could have no exclusive powers; and - that a Constituent Assembly would have absolute power to determine the powers, functions and boundaries of provinces. The latest "offer" by the ANC and NP [National Party] government changes little, since both organisations again refuse to deal with the core objections we have to the interim constitution. My fellow South Africans, my party cannot, in conscience, accept this state of affairs. Constitutions are not drafted to last for a few months or years. The constitution of the greatest democracy on earth, the United State of America, has endured for over 200 years. Constitutions are not there to look to the interests of parties in power -- they are there to protect individuals and minorities against the abuse of power. The National Party government and the SACP/ANC alliance have placed self-interest above the country's interest in negotiating deals to suit themselves. That is not the way to secure our country's constitutional future. What we want as a precondition to securing the well-being of all our people is very simple. We want federalism and we will continue to fight for it. We promise that once this is achieved, we will work day and night for a free and fair election to secure true democracy for every individual in this great country of ours. That is the task my party and I have set ourselves. We will not rest until the job is done. [Signed]Mangosuthu Buthelezi President Inkatha Freedom Party President: The Hon.
