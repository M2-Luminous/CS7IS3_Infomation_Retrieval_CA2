Vigorous domestic demand produced a situation in which the domestic economy was able to absorb more than it could supply. This produced a rise in prices that became the main reason for limiting exports and the encouraging imports. A substantial adverse balance between imports and exports occurred during 1993. China's international balance of payments took a pounding, but high speed economic growth produced an in-flow of foreign capital that made up the deficit in current accounts. Foreign exchange reserves increased slightly, the central bank's foreign exchange holdings remaining basically stable. 1. Changes in the International Balance of Payments Customs statistics show maintenance of a fairly rapid growth momentum in China's foreign trade between January and November 1993, imports and exports totaling $164.2 billion, up 16.5 percent from the same period in 1992. Export growth slowed to $78.25 billion while imports increased greatly to $85.95 billion in a respective 6.2 and 27.8 percent increase over the same period in 1993. The growth rate difference between the two was 21.6 percentage points, and the adverse balance of trade was $7.7 billion. However, in 1992 China had a favorable balance of trade. This and other favorable balance of payments made up for the 1993 adverse balance. By October 1993 the national foreign exchange balance was $260 million more than at the end of 1992. Inasmuch as total trade receipts account for more than 70 percent of China's international balance of payments in today's outwardly oriented economy, an analysis of changes in trade receipts will substantially reflect changes in the country's international balance of payments today. An analysis of 1993 shows the following several characteristics: 1. Change from a favorable to an unfavorable balance between imports and exports beginning at the end of 1992, the unfavorable balance running to $2.021 billion. Except at the beginning of the year, 1993 showed an unfavorable balance, the unfavorable balance for the first three quarters of the year amounting to $1.173, $2.321, and $3.007 billion respectively. October and November showed an adverse balance of $586 million and $613 million respectively. 2. The adverse balance of trade resulted from lackluster exports and a dramatic increase in imports. Since August 1991, imports have increased faster than exports. In 1991, exports increased by 15.81 percent and imports increased by 19.57 percent, exports being 3.76 percentage points less than imports. In 1992, exports increased 18.2 percent and imports increased 26.35 percent, exports being 8.15 percentage points less than imports. During the first three quarters of 1993, exports were a respective 17.94, 19.9, and 28.9 percentage points less than imports, and during October and November, the difference was a respective 16.63 and 21.7 percentage points. 3. During 1993, imports and exports were characterized as follows: 1) Generally slow growth of trade; however, compensation trade, trade from the processing of imported raw materials, and foreign trader investment in enterprises, which required investment in imported equipment and goods, and a supply of imported materials and parts for processing into products for sale within China, increased more rapidly. 2) Imports and exports of primary products declined over the same period in 1992, but imports and exports of industrial manufactures increased. However imports were far greater than exports. 3) In terms of different kinds of enterprises, a sharp increase occurred in the imports and exports of the three kinds of partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises, while the exports of state-owned enterprises, which are China's main exporters, showed negative increase. 4) Changes in the regional make-up of foreign trade included a fairly rapid increase in China's exports to neighboring countries and territories stemming from the strong growth of the southeast Asian economy, and a rapid increase in imports from developed countries. 4. Since July, China has inaugurated a series of macroeconomic structural readjustments. The state intervened in foreign exchange swap markets, the swap market price gradually stabilizing at $1 to 8.80 yuan renminbi. This price was extremely beneficial both in promoting the export trade and in ensuring foreign exchange availability for key projects. This eliminated the effect of the dual pressures that the foreign trade sector faced from rising prices paid to goods suppliers and foreign traders demanding a lower price on goods they purchased, a situation that stemmed from large rises and falls in swap market foreign exchange prices during the first half of the year. Structural readjustments also lowered the temperature of the hot real estate and development zone markets. Thus, the amount of foreign exchange needed for construction materials imports declined, and inventories of raw and processed materials such as processed steel products rose. The increase in urban resident and social group consumption also abated. Because of the shortage of capital and structural readjustments, fixed assets investment growth momentum gradually declined thereafter, and all macroeconomic indicators gradually improved, creating a relaxed environment for imports and exports. With improvement of the macroeconomic situation, imports and exports will enter a fairly stable growth stage after the beginning of the fourth quarter; however, a basic reversal in the adverse balance between imports and exports for the whole year will be very difficult. For the year as a whole, a certain adverse balance between imports and exports will remain, and a demand for foreign exchange that is greater than the amount of foreign exchange that exports generate will continue into 1994. However, because of the acceleration of capital inflow in the short run, plus the country's current foreign exchange holdings and the Bank of China's foreign exchange supply, continuation of the present adverse balance between imports and exports poses no risks. 2. Analysis of the Reasons for Changes in Current Accounts The year 1993 was one of high speed growth for the national economy. Thanks to the inertia provided by a 12.8 percent growth in GDP during 1992, GDP for the first three quarters of 1993 increased 13.3 percent over the same period in the previous year. Forecasts call for approximately 13 percent growth for the year as a whole. Without doubt, the current adverse balance between imports and exports is attributable to changes in the operation of the economy in 1993. This is another way of saying that strong domestic investment demand and consumption demand pulled a rise in prices, which delivered an enormous pounding to the balance of foreign trade, holding down exports and increasing imports. Specifically, the following reasons apply: 1. A Cumulative and Easy Money Policy, and Too Large a Supply of Currency The adverse effect of money on an economy is caused by too great an amount of money becoming available within a short period. Following the retrenchment between October 1988 and October 1989, China pursued an easy money policy beginning in 1990. Between 1990 and 1992, the central bank increased the basic money supply by 26.9, 29.1, and 17.4 percent each year. This showed that total money supply in the broad sense, M[.sub]2[/], also reached 27.9, 26.8, and 31.3 percent, thereby basically exceeding the sum of both economic growth and the rise in prices for the same year. One might assume that the pessimistic forecasts of principal economic entities regarding the overall operating environment caused a blockage of channels for the transfer of currency to the economy. The currency supply became a cumulative force waiting to be released. In 1992, the economy began to liven up. It became quite apparent at this time that the money supply was beginning to move in the direction of highly fluid currency levels such as M[.sub]0[/], and M[.sub]1[/]. This meant that during 1993, M[.sub]2[/] fell from 31.3 percent at the end of the year to 30.3 percent at the end of March, 26.5 percent at the end of June, 22.2 percent at the end of September, and 24.2 percent at the end of November. Despite the month-by-month slide, it remained high over the long run. Meanwhile, growth of money in the narrow sense was fast at 19.2 percent in 1990, 24.2 percent in 1991, and 35.8 percent in 1992. During 1993, it remained substantially stable at a 35 percent increase for the first half of the year, beginning to slow only during the last half of the year. Beginning from 34.2 percent in June, it declined to 20.5 percent in September, and 20.9 percent in November. During the same period, M[.sub]0[/] -- the amount of money in circulation -- exceeded 40 percent for 8 months, going from 31.3 percent early in the year to 54.1 percent at its height in June and returning to 38.2 and 35.3 percent respectively in October and November. As the government gradually relaxed trade restrictions and China's economy became linked more and more to the world economy, monetary policy played an increasingly stronger role on the international balance of payments. This has been attested to by the central bank's balance sheet in recent years. We know that the basic money supply equals net assets abroad and domestic credit. This is a simple identical equation used in accounting. When the money demand constant remains stable, meaning that the basic money supply remains stable, changes in domestic credit will be made up by net assets abroad. The cushioning effect of net assets abroad partially vitiates the effect of central bank monetary policy, limiting the extent of its effectiveness. Of course, in addition to considering the amount of assets available at this time, one must also take into account the following: the economic entities holding the assets, ability to draw on them quickly, and the psychological effect of the state's drawing on foreign exchange assets. Since 1992, the basic amount of currency put into circulation has varied, e.g., it declined from 26.5 percent at the beginning of 1992 to 17.4 percent at the end of the year, and to 6.5 percent at the beginning of 1993 after which it began to climb again. It went from 19.8 percent in February to 20.8 percent in June, 23.2 percent in August, and 34.8 percent in October. This corresponded to the amount of domestic credit for the most part, which went from 18.3 percent at the end of 1992 to 33.9 percent in October 1993. Since 1993, foreign exchange holdings have remained basically unchanged. Foreign exchange savings increased hardly at all between November and the beginning of 1993. One can conclude that the effect of currency on the economy, particularly in the foreign trade sector where transfers require a certain amount of time, is gradually producing an effect on the international balance of payments. 2. Speed of Investment in Fixed Assets Fairly High This is one of the main features of the current economic cycle. The pull of investment became the main force spurring high speed operation of the entire economy. In 1992, investment in fixed assets owned by the whole people reached 40.7 percent. Since 1993, there has been no abatement in enthusiasm for starting projects by all jurisdictions and all sectors because of the returns that can be made, nor hast there been any marked improvement in the kinds of projects in which investments are being made. During the first half of the year, state-owned units investment in fixed assets increased by more than 70 percent. Despite a downturn following readjustment and control, the cumulative 10 month increase was still 65.2 percent. The domestic economy cannot stand an increase of investment in fixed assets on such a scale; thus, expansion of imports was needed to satisfy domestic demand. 3. Sustained Rise in Domestic Prices, Particularly in Large- and Medium-Sized Cities Pulled by overly high fixed assets investment demand and stable yet rising consumption demand, nominal variates changed in the face of shortages, the price level rising to check the gap between supply and demand. Moreover, change in the price level pulled imports and exports in turn, bringing about changes. On the one hand, the rise in prices brought the prospect of profits, which stimulated hot selling goods such as building materials and electrical appliances. On the other hand, the rise in prices caused a rise in the foreign exchange cost of exports. A shortage of major export commodities occurred, foreign trade corporations finding it more difficult to assemble exports. In March 1993, retail prices of social commodities broke the double digit mark to reach 10.2 percent after increasing 5.4 percent in the previous year. By September, prices rose a cumulative 12.1 percent to 14.5 percent for the month. Meanwhile, the staff member and employee 14.8 percent cost of living index reached 16.9 percent in September. As the economy heated up, once again it became more profitable to see commodities in the domestic market rather than export them. 4. Decline in Export Foreign Exchange Conversion Rate; Large Outflow of State-owned Assets Foreign exchange receivable from exports for the period January through July 1993 totaled $36.798 billion, but only $20.306 billion, or 55.18 percent, of foreign exchange was converted. In addition to an increase in exports by three kinds of partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises, and an increase in the percentage of exchange settlements not handled, the main reason for the decline in the rate of foreign exchange conversions was an increase in foreign accounts receivable, which were retained abroad for investment. Furthermore, insufficient attention was paid to follow-up work in verifying and writing off exports after the fact, so where large amounts of foreign exchange went was a mystery. 5. External Economy Unsatisfactory Foreign trade corporations export difficulties increased as a result of the general economic slump and recession in Western industrial countries, a rise in trade protectionism, current trade frictions between China and the United States, and trouble from constant anti-dumping investigations in the E.C. The world economic situation has declined continuously since the beginning of the 1990s. In 1992, world GNP increased only 0.7 percent, and the 1993 increase is forecast at 0.9 percent. In 1994, the world economy may begin to revive. Forecasts call for a 2.6 increase in world GNP then. In recent years, international trade has been in a similar slump. Forecasts call for a respective 4.3 and 6.2 percent increase in world trade volume in 1993 and 1994. Forecasts call for a 1 percent increase in the GNP of developed market economy countries. This includes a 2.7 percent increase in North America, and a 0.4 percent decline in the EC. The main reason for the economic recession in developed countries is insufficient domestic and foreign demand. In 1993, developed countries' exports declined 0.1 percent and imports increased 0.1 percent. In developing countries -- particularly in southeast Asia -- economic growth is strong. In 1993, GNP increased 5.3 percent in developing countries, and imports and exports increased by 9.9 and 8.4 percent respectively. During the next two years, an even more booming development trend will continue. Since the economy of East Europe is in a period of change of economic systems, all sorts of political and economic conflicts are extremely glaring there. Its economy is in severe recession, both production and exports declining. The world economic recession has a direct effect on China's foreign trade. First of all, domestic demand is insufficient in numerous countries. This limits the increase in China's exports. Second, owing to the insufficient domestic demand in countries undergoing an economic recession, products must be exported in order to be sold. Consequently, international market competition is more intense, adding to China's export difficulties. Finally, the intense export market competition makes it easier for China to import. In summary, the effect of the world economic slump on China's foreign sector is: bad for exports; good for imports. 3. Capital Receipts and Expenditures China's 1992 international balance of payments schedule, which was drawn up in 1993, shows -$25 billion for capital. This includes long term capital of $65.6 billion and short term capital of -$90.6 billion. The long term capital is a positive figure that reflects foreign investors' view of the China market's development prospects. During the first half of 1993, China approved 43,632 foreign trader investment projects calling for the investment of $58.756 billion. The actual amount of foreign capital used was $9.396 billion. This was a respective 234.3, 300.3, and 179.8 percent increase over the same period in 1992. In addition was other long-term capital obtained. Long-term capital for January through August should also be a positive figure. The -$90.6 billion in short-term capital reflects not only an increase during 1993 in the amount of short-term foreign loan capital and interest that China paid, but foreign capital's use of the China market for speculation should also evoke serious attention. The net inflow of China's foreign borrowing has decreased relatively in recent years, and the foreign debt balance has slowly increased. By comparison with the initial period of foreign borrowing, the debt repayment burden will increase. In view of the present import-export situation and the country's foreign exchange reserves, we must strictly control the flow of short-term capital in order to prevent a situation that is detrimental to the internal economy. Capital has always been closely related to the use of foreign capital, but China is guilty of seriously abnormal behavior in its current use of foreign capital. According to a Shandong branch bank survey, the main problems are in the following regards: 1. Rather blatant issuance of IOUs by the foreign party in concerns in which foreign traders have invested. This show up strongly in the low percentage of investment funds that the foreign trader provides. According to Qingdao Port Business Department survey statistics on concerns in which Chinese and foreign traders have invested, foreign traders provide only 46 percent of funds, a 23 percent decline from the same period in the previous year. 2. High debt businesses in which foreign traders shift risks to China. In enterprises in which foreign traders have invested, Chinese banks provide the registered capital of both parties, with the result that the foreign party's actual capital investment is a very small percentage of the total capital invested in the enterprise -- approximately 10 percent. In order to do business on a proper scale, enterprises in which foreign traders invest obtain large amounts of capital from inside China, incurring a lot of debt. This creates a situation in which foreign capital makes use of domestic capital. 3. Existence of phony joint ventures. Not only are their phony joint venture enterprises that have no foreign investment, but there are also joint venture enterprises in which the Chinese party invests nothing or very little. Five of the nine joint venture enterprises founded since 1992 in Qihe County, Shandong are phony joint enterprises. This is 56 percent of all enterprises and 58 percent of all foreign-invested enterprises. 4. Some foreign-invested enterprises borrow back foreign debt under the guise of a joint venture. The method used is as follows: Although both parties to the joint venture have signed a joint venture agreement, this is simply a formality for the foreign party. Both parties also secretly sign an additional agreement that provides that no matter whether the enterprises shows a profit or a loss, the Chinese party must return to the foreign trader the foreign trader's investment with interest. 5. Imbalance between foreign exchange receipts and expenditures in concerns in which foreign traders invest becoming increasingly serious. Even though concerns in which foreign traders have invested take more foreign exchange foreign exchange swap markets than they put in, a substantial portion of what they take out is investment money and not foreign exchange earnings from exports. Therefore, as the number of enterprises in which foreign traders invest increases, the pressure they exert on the swap markets will become greater, causing instability in swap prices. 4. Changes in Foreign Exchange Reserves, and Changes in Swap Market Prices Inasmuch as Chinese trading system is not an entirely open market economy system, and since the exchange rate system is not a freely floating exchange rate system, changes in China's international balance of payments are ultimately expressed in changes in the quantity and price of foreign exchange. Adjustments in quantity and price bring balance to the international balance of payments. China's definition of foreign exchange reserves has changed since 1993. Prior to this time, foreign exchange reserves included both the national foreign exchange balance and the banks foreign exchange supply In a planned economy, such a definition is doubtlessly a correct one; however, since China's specialized banks do some foreign exchange import-export settlement business, and with the founding of a socialist market economy system, naturally a new definition of foreign exchange reserves is needed. The International Monetary Fund definition is that a country's foreign exchange reserves are foreign exchange than can be taken without compensation and used freely. Therefore, China's current definition of foreign exchange includes the state's foreign exchange balance. China's foreign exchange reserves have changed but little since 1993. Starting at $19.443 billion at the beginning of the year, they stabilized at about $19 billion in October. Within a short period, foreign exchange reserves exhibited a declining trend, but in July the central bank conducted open market trading for the first time. It began to intervene in the foreign exchange market to hold down too greatly fluctuating price changes. Since the quantity of foreign exchange changed but little, foreign exchange swap market prices changed greatly. As imports increased sharply and exports weakened, the effective supply of foreign exchange decreased and the shortfall between supply and demand increased. Exchange prices fluctuated substantially, thereby creating a bad effect on imports and exports. Because the government acted to limit trading at the end of February, swap markets did no business for a time. Some major players took the opportunity to hoard foreign exchange in anticipation of steady profits from rises in swap price quotes. Following price deregulation on 1 June, foreign exchange trading volume steadily rose. However, it was during this period that the rise in foreign exchange swap prices was also greatest. In the principal foreign exchange swap markets throughout the country, the weighted average price of $1 reached a maximum of 10.90 yuan renminbi. In Hainan Province, the price reached 11.20 yuan per $1.00. After the government intervened directly in the market in July, the exchange price stabilized very quickly at 8.80 yuan per $1, and this price has remained until the present. 5. Assessment of the Current Overall International Balance of Payments Situation and 1994 Situation Forecast Currently, import and export fluctuations are still within the normal economic range. Since domestic demand is greater than current supply capabilities, imports must be expanded in order to raise the standard of living and welfare of the citizenry as a whole, and fluctuations in imports and exports per se also show that the domestic economy is growing at full tilt, and that the economy has entered a new round of expansion. Nevertheless, the long-term trend of changes in imports and exports suggests no cause for optimism about future prospects. Historically, once the domestic economy shows signs of overheating, the possibility is very slight that macroeconomic regulation and control measures can fine tune the economy. Should this adverse balance between imports and exports last for a fairly long time, foreign exchange reserves dwindling as a result and making it necessary to slam down on the economic brakes, great ups and downs will occur in the operation of the economy. Looked at from this angle, the main problem that imports and exports face today remains dependence for survival on good operation of the domestic economy and normal operation of the microeconomy. Only when all latent factors leading to large ups and downs in imports and exports are brought under control will imports and exports attain the goal of serving development of the domestic economy to the maximum extent. A look at the world economic situation: The world economy may gradually get out of its predicament in 1994. Prospects are that the economy of all countries will enter a slow growth stage. Forecasts call for a 2.5 percent growth of world GNP in 1994, the average annual GNP growth rate for developed countries reaching 4 percent, and economic growth of developing countries being markedly faster than that of developed countries. A 5 percent GNP growth rate is forecast for developing countries in 1994. In 1994, the economy of the former Soviet and East European countries will begin a weak revival in 1994, and gradually exhibit a fine growth momentum. Their 1994 GNP will increase 1.5 percent. As the world economy revives and gradually enters a normal development stage, prospects are that the entire world trade situation will rapidly improve. Estimates call for an approximately 6.9 percent increase in world exports in 1994. The world economic situation is moving in a direction that is favorable to China's foreign trade balance. A look at the domestic supply and demand situation: As a result of the macroeconomic regulation and control measures instituted in July 1993, the high speed economic growth express train will slow don in 1994. Inasmuch as this is a one-time rather than a continuing readjustment of the economic structure, the economy will continue to operate in high gear during 1994. This will provide conditions to easing bottlenecks (including finance bottlenecks and resources bottlenecks). Total supply may be more than the domestic market can absorb in 1994; therefore, foreign demand will gradually play an important role. At look at the international balance of payments situation: Because of the substantial adverse balance of foreign trade in 1993, China's foreign exchange balance will decline. Therefore, the use of foreign exchange for imports will decline in 1994, holding down an increase in imports. Weakening of growth momentum in domestic investment demand will also restrict the importation of means of production making the speed of increase in commodity imports less during 1994 than in 1993. Moreover, because of an upswing in international market demand and a slowing of domestic demand, forecasts call for exports to increase more in 1994 than in 1993. However, since the base figure for 1993 exports was small, and since the base figure for 1993 imports was large, China may still show a trade deficit in its foreign trade balance for 1994.
