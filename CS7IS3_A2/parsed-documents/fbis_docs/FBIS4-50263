Petrosyan said that a peace agreement could be signed this week on the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and the war in the enclave may end this year. Petrosyan told a press conference in Ereven on Saturday [14 May] that the defense ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia and the military leader of Nagorno-Karabakh were going to meet under the Russian defense minister's mediation in Moscow on Monday. Petrosyan expressed his belief that a peace agreement would be signed after three days of the meeting. The military leaders attending the meeting are to discuss a time table for sending peace-keeping forces to the Nagorno-Karabakh region and sites of their deployment. Nagorno-Karabakh, an autonomous region technically within Azerbaijan, is populated largely by Armenians. A separatist movement began in 1988, leading to the declaration of an independent republic in the region in September 1991. A senior Azerbaijani official disclosed last Saturday that during the four years of conflict an estimated 20,000 Azerbaijanis have been killed and a further 50,000 maimed.
