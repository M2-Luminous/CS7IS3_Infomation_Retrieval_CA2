This was recently stated by He Jihai, vice-president of the State Ministry of Internal Trade, at the national spring commodity fair held in Tianjin. According to He, China will soon lift certain restrictions on its retail trade to encourage the growth of chain stores. Foreign investors are welcome to set up and develop more chain stores in China in order to promote the reform and renewal of China's traditional ways of operation in commercial activities. Commercial enterprises are also encouraged to take advantage of the new round of reforms in the transformation of operating mechanisms and to establish chain shops or chain commercial groups with Chinese characteristics but strictly in accordance with international standards through combination, transfer of assets and introduction of stock system. Enterprises allowed to set up chain stores include restaurants, supermarkets, book stores, jewelry stores and pharmacies. Statistics of the Ministry of Internal Trade show that China now has 100-plus chain stores, concentrated in large cities. Less than one-third of them have reached international standards.
