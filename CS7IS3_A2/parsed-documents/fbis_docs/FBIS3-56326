He is currently in Japan to attend Russian-Japanese consultations on the question of visa-free exchange between the inhabitants of the Kurils and Japan. Nikolay Pokidin noted that within the framework of Japanese humanitarian aid, the goods reaching the South Kurils are mainly those which the region does not need. "For example," he went on, "we were recently sent a consignment of television sets and tape recorders that one would hardly describe as an urgent necessity. At the same time, we cannot get hold of medical supplies and medical equipment for which we have an acute need. If Japan herself has declared a desire to assist us she should listen to our wishes so as not to waste her money." According to Nikolay Pokidin, over the past year the South Kurils and Kurils regions have been granted Japanese aid totalling 1.5 million dollars. Meanwhile, Gennadiy Dolin, the head of administration of the Kurils region, noted in an interview to an ITAR-TASS correspondent, well-organized Japanese assistance may help to solve the many complex problems that exist. Last year, for example, within the framework of humanitarian aid, Japan delivered a major consignment of medical supplies for the Kurils regional hospital, thus rendering invaluable help to the local people. "However, we are interested not so much in humanitarian aid as in long-term economic cooperation which so far, unfortunately, Japan has refrained from doing," Gennadiy Dolin pointed out. Both local administration chiefs described the economic situation on the Kurils as critical. In their words, the Russian Government only says it cares about this part of Russia which is remote from Moscow, and is not doing anything practical at all. Workers at a number of local enterprises have not received their salaries for several months now, the local authorities' budget is falling apart, and there are insufficient funds even to ensure that transport functions normally and that basic social needs are met. In addition, the crime situation is deteriorating rapidly on the Kurils -- the number of robberies and thefts is rising and shots ring out, fired by "fighters" from opposing groups of the "car Mafia." In these circumstances more and more people are leaving the islands. In the past year the population of the "Northern Territories," as the Japanese call the South Kurils, has fallen by around 1,500 people. "This spring we are expecting another surge in the flow of people away from the islands. Many families have already sold their homes and got ready to leave for the mainland once the navigation season starts," Gennadiy Dolin said. Nikolay Pokidin noted bitterly that the grave economic situation was making the view that the South Kurils should be handed over to Japan increasingly widespread among the local population. The head of administration of the South Kurils area expressed the view that in the foreseeable future the South Kurils would not be handed over to Japan. "There is no Russian politician who would take such a step," he said.
