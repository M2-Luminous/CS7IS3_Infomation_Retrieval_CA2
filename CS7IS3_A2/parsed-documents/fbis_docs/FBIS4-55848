At the start of the news conference, the Yugoslav foreign minister recalled that the government reviewed and adopted three reports at its session today -- on the announcement from the meeting of the five foreign ministers (United States, Russia, Greece, France, and Belgium) devoted to the resolution of the Bosnian crisis, on the meeting of the economic group within the framework of the international conference on former Yugoslavia, and on the recent visit by Zoran Lilic, president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY], and Vladislav Jovanovic to the Republic of South Africa. According to Jovanovic, the Federal Government today expressed a positive stance on the announcement of the five ministers in Geneva, especially the part renouncing the war option. "However, we pointed to the practical shortcomings that have faithfully accompanied earlier initiatives of this kind: the unequal treatment of all the protagonists in the Yugoslav crisis, certain remaining forms of hostility, and the fact that the international community should take a more balanced approach in the process of establishing full equality and lifting the sanctions." The first question to Jovanovic (APA) concerned his recent statement about war cries from Austria and Albania. Jovanovic replied that it would be best if there were no such cries from any country. "Unfortunately, Austria and Albania were involved in the process of the disintegration of former Yugoslavia in the most flagrant and aggressive way, just as they are now involved in exerting pressure on the FRY," he said. Jovanovic added that this also refers to their insisting that the sanctions should stay and be further tightened and to their "very aggressive attitude toward Kosovo and Metohija, Sandzak and Vojvodina." "We would like this hostile attitude to end," the Yugoslav foreign minister said. Jovanovic was then asked to present Yugoslavia's position on the proposed territorial division of Bosnia-Herzegovina based on the 49- 51 percent principle. Having recalled the recent meetings with important international factors, he replied that everyone was clearly told about Yugoslavia's vital interest -- the immediate and permanent cessation of hostilities in Bosnia and, as far as the percentage is concerned, "it is a matter for the three warring sides to agree on." A reporter of the Slovene news agency was almost astonished about the greetings which the federal prime minister and the foreign minister extended to their Italian colleagues clearly alluding to the victory of the Right. Jovanovic first said that such greetings from Belgrade are not at all unusual. As for the victory of the Right, Jovanovic said, Yugoslavia is not going to get involved since this would mean interfering in Italy's internal affairs. "We do not have a single serious problem in our relations with Italy and we wish to develop cooperation with this country and all other countries," Jovanovic said." Commenting on the position adopted by the five foreign ministers on the sanctions, voiced at the recent meeting in Geneva, Jovanovic stressed that this was the first time that Europe, Russia and the United States expressed a joint position on the issue. According to him, the fact that the lifting of the sanctions is not linked with a final solution to the Bosnian conflict is also positive. "That is a certain step forward, but not big enough, because it does not lift the sanctions which are a huge obstacle to peace in Bosnia," Jovanovic said. A STUDENT correspondent asked Jovanovic: "Up to when will the Africanization of Yugoslavia continue, considering that the nonaligned countries were among the first to stab our country in the back, and when will Yugoslavia return to where it belongs -- to Europe." "First, speaking about stabbing in the back, the blow did not come from Africa, but from Europe," Jovanovic said. "Second, African nonaligned countries wanted to help Yugoslavia, but the former federal government tactically prevented that by turning its back on those countries and asking for assistance from the European Community." "And third, our activities are not leading to the Africanization of the country. We are a European country although we are now excluded from Europe," Jovanovic said. The next question referred to "the halt" in relations between the FRY and Croatia. "The reasons for the halt, if that is true, lie with Croatia. I would like to remind you that the Deputy Federal Prime Minister Zeljko Simic visited Zagreb without any preconditions," Jovanovic said. "We expected, and continue to expect Croatian Deputy Prime Minister Mate Granic to come to Belgrade, but he has set conditions for his visit. That means that the FRY is not slowing down the development of relations with Croatia," the Yugoslav foreign minister said. Asked by the Macedonian radio correspondent about relations between the FRY and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia], Jovanovic said that "we, on our part, have done nothing to make these relations what they are today." "All problems were caused as a result of Macedonia's activities. Macedonia opted for secession and got into trouble with Greece. It is denying our right to succession by advocating secession. This is at terrible loggerheads with reality," Jovanovic said. "The moment Macedonia resolves its problem with Greece and acknowledges our right to succession and continuity, normalization will ensue." Are there any differences in the U.S. and European approach to the process of resolving the Yugoslav crisis? "As far as we are concerned, Europe neither has the same interests as the United States nor does it view the future development of the former Yugoslavia in the same way, because it is aware that if the crisis drags on, with all its elements -- including the sanctions -- this will also be fatal for Europe. The destabilization of the Balkans poses a threat to the whole of Europe," Jovanovic said. A German correspondent asked whether the federal foreign minister was consulted before the decision was made to withdraw certain foreign correspondents' credentials. At the same time he expressed his "surprise" that not one German correspondent had been put on this list. Jovanovic replied briefly that the decision on the withdrawal of credentials was under the jurisdiction of the Federal Information Ministry. Information Minister Slobodan Ignjatovic dealt with the surprise. "I am pleased that you are surprised that credentials were not withdrawn from German correspondents. This strengthens my conviction that you too are aware of the objectivity, or the lack thereof -- displayed by certain reporters. This does not mean that we are pleased with the objectivity of what certain reporters are writing. There are limits."
