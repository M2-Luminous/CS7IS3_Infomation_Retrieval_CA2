Krasnov, Voyennoye izdatelstvo 1991, 6,000 copies, 271 pages] [Text] Forward The great importance of fighter aviation under present-day conditions is determined by the essence of Soviet defensive doctrine. Fighter aviation must reliably protect the troops and installations of the nation's rear from air strikes and support the combat actions of other arms of aviation. New-generation aircraft are entering the fighter aviation armament with high tactical performance and powerful weaponry, and its command posts are being equipped with increasingly sophisticated automated control systems. It is impossible to fully utilize the high combat capabilities of the new equipment without knowledge of tactics, however. Tactics teach how to vanquish the enemy in the most difficult situation, to execute combat actions with the least forces by virtue of surprise, strategem, and a creative approach to the task. However it often happens that aviation commanders and pilots do not bother either with cunning calculation or bold original maneuver, and the importance of tactics as the art of waging battle is belittled. These defects are an inheritance of those times when display and show were in honor, when directives and instructions suppressed initiative and combat activeness, and the monotonous background of exercises taught the men not so much to think as to execute. Perestroyka in Soviet society is changing all aspects of its life. Now as never before air commanders and all flight personnel are expected to show flexibility of tactical thinking, especially in sharp tactical situations, the ability to form and to defend one's position, to discard outmoded tactical devices, and to look toward the future. For this it is important to understand those changes which have occurred and are occurring today in tactics, in practice air-to-air battles distinguished by more resolute goals, high effectiveness, and diversity of tactical techniques. This book reveals the basic problems of tactics of fighter aviation and the components of tactical mastery of fighter pilots (the author calls them the secrets of irresistible attacks). From all the variety of these questions the book cites the most important and interesting. They are discussed in accessible form and at the same time without excessive simplification. The author introduces us to the history of tactics, ably drawing on the experience of air battles of the Great Patriotic War. The development of the tactics of fighter aviation and its problems are discussed as they apply to the combat missions of fighters, improvement of aviation equipment, tactics of the adversary, and the place of fighters in air defense systems. Explaining the law-governed regularities in the evolution of combat missions, in the relations of tactics and equipment, in the confrontation of tactics of friendly and enemy fighters, in their interaction with ground air defense systems in the past, present and future is a difficult task, but I believe that the author has accomplished it. The theoretical material, combined with lively instructive examples never before cited in our literature, and the necessary commentaries will help the reader to understand the essence of specific phenomena of tactics. Questions of tactical training of aviators are discussed with the same completeness and soundness. Here the reader will also find much that is interesting. Recommendations for planning of air-to-air battles and developing tactical techniques, the use of stratagems in battle, and rational use of the time factor, command and control of the battle, on morale and psychological preparation of the flight personnel, and other advice gives this part of the book a practical bent. The author does not limit himself to demonstrating only the positive in combat training of fighter aviation; he also explains the causes of negative phenomena in tactics, and the ways of making combat training nearer to combat reality, and cautions aviation commanders, pilots, officers of command posts, and students in VVUZ [military higher educational institutions] (namely, those to whom this book is addressed) against possible errors. The author of this book, professor and doctor of military sciences, participant in the Great Patriotic War, A.B. Krasnov, now working in the field of tactics, has managed to trace the paths of its development quite fully, to make broad generalizations and interesting conclusions. His book, which is in harmony with the times in terms of content and the logic of his arguments, promotes creativity in tactics, and leads one to think. Without a doubt it will interest not only aviators of our generation; veterans and youngsters preparing for service in military aviation will also enjoy it. I recommend this book to the readers with pleasure. Col.-Gen. of Aviation A. Borsuk Introduction The intermittent howl of the engines carries down from the skies. The tight flows of air strike the blades of turbines, sending the winged craft forward to where the adversary has prepared for a frontal attack, his airborne weapons in full readiness for battle. Two opposing groups of fighters face a heated skirmish. Another moment and the aircraft flash into view, cascades of maneuvers merge into an unending chain executed at the limits of capabilities of man and machine, now and again the smoky trails of launched missiles rip the limpid blue. The dogfight begins, a confrontation of human intellects, a competition of the courage, endurance, and self-control of the participants in each attack. In short attacks are concentrated the experience and knowledge of the pilots, displaying the ability to resist the enemy with their will and mastery. The strength of the elements is even, tactical performance and the conditions of joining battle approximately the same. Whose side will prove to have the invincible attack? Whose missiles will more quickly find and destroy their assigned targets? In the book, the tactics of fighter aviation reveal the secrets of irresistible fighter attacks. Its title requires explanation. What secrets are we talking about? Those which are part of the tactical proficiency of flight personnel. How may we foresee the actions of the adversary and model the battle, how many tactical techniques must be held in reserve, how best may we use the high capabilities of our weapons, how can we outsmart the enemy and ably control the battle? All these are the secrets of irresistible attacks, or components of tactical proficiency, which the pilot cannot do without. In order to grasp these secrets, however, one must first turn to the factors which determine the development of tactics. The dynamism of the changes occurring in tactics will depend on the changes in the content of combat missions which are performed by fighters. The improvement in aviation equipment leads to the development of tactics and the replacement of some tactical techniques by others. Obviously the corresponding demands are imposed on tactics by an active adversary, forcing abandonment of the prevailing stereotypes. Without the adversary there can be no tactics, just as there can be none without the ground air defense systems which interact closely with the fighters and share the success of battle with them. The influence on tactical development of these factors, which are not identical and at times even contradictory, is traced in the first part of the book. They are closely connected to one another, and only for convenience of discussion are they examined separately. The second part of the book relates successively the activity of commanders, pilots, officers of command posts in preparation for battle, during battle, and in command and control of battle, and addresses the inculcation of high morale and aggressiveness. It should be stipulated at the outset that the book is not intended for specialists who know all the subtleties of aviation equipment. We are far more interested in the tactical aspect of the matter than the specific tactical performance of even the latest models of equipment and design features. Because of this, some things have to be simplified, some things mentioned in passing. However the reader will look in vain in the book for ready-made prescriptions of irresistible attacks, i.e., tactical recommendations. There are too many of them, and situations in battle are such that only a specific tactical technique must correspond to each of them. But on the other hand, that which is good the first time, is worse the second, and the tenth time even harmful -- this is a typical lack of originality. Thus identical tactical technique, even if optimal, does not help when repeated again and again. This is what they have in mind when they say that there are no prescriptions in tactics, so it is important not to "write prescriptions" but to have the entire "pharmacy" available, in order to have the necessary tactical technique on hand at any moment. This is tactical proficiency, proficiency of the commander, the pilot, the command post officers, as necessary to him as air, in order to quickly and appropriately select those very "prescriptions" which allegedly do not exist in tactics, and to use them steadfastly and precisely in battle. Today tactics are developing especially quickly. The marked defensive nature of our military doctrine and the obligations undertaken by the Soviet Union not to initiate military actions objectively may give certain advantages to the attacking side in the surprise delivery of air strikes. We cannot but take this into account. In such situations, when the initiative belongs to the adversary, many traditional ideas regarding the role and place of fighters in the repulse of aggression, and the modes of combat action they utilize will change. The most urgent need for changes in tactics, and the old thinking, the outmoded leadership style, born in the time of stagnation, come into conflict. How could one reveal here the cause and effect links of phenomena and discard prevailing stereotypes, if at the time triumphant reports from exercises and sham were considered more important than creativity in tactics, if any maxim uttered from above, arising now from ambition, now from "intuition," was substantiated and scientifically confirmed?! Of course when the issue is voluntarism in tactics, the word "intuition" must be taken in quotes. And here, strange as it may seem, our readiness to immediately react to various sorts of directives, authoritative instructions and recommendations, was not averted even by the sad lessons of the past, the tragic consequences of distortions concerning the role and place of fighter aviation, and justification of the "sole correct" provisions of tactics. The world of tactics is complex and contradictory. Gradually expanding its borders, it today offers fighters many new and unexpected paths, not even guessed at just a few years ago. Sometimes answers to them, albeit incomplete, may be found in the experience of the past, and in the practice of the best pilots, others are soundly answered by military theorists. But how many problems there are to which no one has yet found an answer! Thus if neither accumulated experience nor simple and reasonable discussion suggest how to proceed in order to achieve victory in battle, the secrets of irresistible attacks must remain unrevealed for some time. But is this surprising? It has happened in the history of tactics more than once. We shall peruse the pages of the long-ago and recent past, examining those events which became turning points in the development of tactics, accelerating or slowing it, and then we shall examine the present, and try to look at the future of tactics. The goal of the book is to prompt the reader to reflect, and to offer food for thought. So the reader will not always find unequivocal assessments in the book, and some problems of tactics are analyzed in it from different, sometimes paradoxical viewpoints. Study and pondering of these problems will allow one to see and better understand the novelty of the current tactics, to overcome any established dogmas, and to conduct a quest for the new in tactics. In other words, we are all the creators of tactics. PART I. FIGHTERS IN BATTLE Chapter I. What Missions Should Fighters Perform? The fighter was developed for battle. Its basic purpose is to destroy the adversary in the air. Air-to-air combat began immediately with the appearance of aircraft over battlefields of the First World War, which conducted reconnaissance and delivered strikes and ground troops. Initially the lighter and faster aircraft were used as fighters, and then special planes were developed with airborne machineguns. Thus did fighter aviation [FA] begin its existence. In a short time fighter aviation was faced with many combat missions. It protected the troops and important rear installations from attack of enemy aircraft, safeguarded the security and freedom of action of friendly bombers and scout planes. The basic missions of Soviet fighter aviation, which grew up from separate aviation detachments of the czarist army, remained essentially missions which were accomplished in the First World War. However, the October socialist revolution breathed new life into the content of these missions and fighter tactics. What did the first red military pilots hand down to their descendants? Massing of fighter aviation forces in decisive axes of action of troops, protecting cavalry elements of the Red Army, highly mobile for the times, in critical situations on the fronts, were developed and used widely in the fire of the civil war. Secrets of irresistible attacks of Soviet fighter pilots consisted of able maneuver, the use of concealment in the sun, haze, "dead" zones of observation and fire of enemy aircraft, rapid and surprise closing and commencement of fire. They conducted resolute and active combat actions, set up ambushes on raiding routes of enemy aviation, and bravely attacked even a numerically superior enemy. After the end of the civil war, the missions and tactics of FA were formed on the basis of developing views of its combat utilization. It was considered the basic means of fighting for superiority in the air, and had the main mission of repelling, jointly with antiaircraft artillery, the raids of aviation attacking friendly forces. In the skies of Spain and China, over the Khalkhin-Gol river and in the war with the White Finns, the role of missions assigned to FA gradually increased. From the standpoint of improving tactics, air-to-air combat was characterized by the development of fire and tactical coordination in groups of fighters of different types. Usually the fast I-16 (fig. 1) [not reproduced] fighters joined battle first and forced the enemy to maneuver, then he was attacked by the I-15 (fig. 2) [not reproduced] maneuver aircraft. The tactics of fighter aviation in these battles were enriched by diverse techniques of multiple-aircraft air-to-air combat, but many questions still awaited solution. Too few air-to-air battles were conducted, and in addition they were marked by some uniformity and usually broke up into battles of small groups or individual aircraft. With such uncoordinated actions it was hard to coordinate the efforts of pilots to achieve success. The division of fighters into fast and maneuverable aircraft ceased to be justified. For battle with new aircraft of the probable adversary, fast, highly maneuverable, well-armed machines were needed, but, from the experience of two years of war in Europe, no reasonable conclusions were drawn, and FA tactics were not revised. Such are only a few fragments of the prehistory of FA tactics before the start of the Great Patriotic War. No one yet knew what the tactics of the coming war would be, the tactics which later more than one generation of pilots would turn to. The basic tasks of fighter aviation when the war started were destruction of enemy aviation in air-to-air battles for air superiority, protection of troops and rear installations, support of combat actions of other arms of aviation, aerial reconnaissance, and actions against ground targets. Each of these missions had its own organization and its own modes of combat action, its own group of original tactical techniques. Since those days many generations of fighters have come and gone, but they all even now perform these tasks. Only the tactics have changed. Without considering these changes in strict chronological order, let us just follow how the content of combat missions of fighter aviation was improved at the turning points in the development of tactics. 1. In Battles For Air Superiority Air superiority became a necessity with the June dawn of forty-one, when the airplanes pelted by enemy bombs burned at our airfields. It was as vital as air to the troops, navy, and aviation, in order to halt the fascist invaders, to create for the attack planes and bombers the opportunity to deliver fighter strikes on the enemy. The fighter pilots displayed mass heroism and unprecedented courage in the very first battles for air superiority. They resolutely attacked the enemy even when they were in the minority, sought to draw from their equipment everything which it could give, to gain victory at the cost of life itself. But the fascist "Messerschmitts" had a maximum speed of 500-550 km/hr, and our I-15s and I-16s only 360-460 km/hr. There were still only a few new planes. Therefore, our fighters lacked the advantage of speed and consequently of vertical maneuver, and fought the air-to-air battles by maneuvering in the horizontal plane (banked turns). I believe I am not revealing a secret when I say that the bravest pilot in a bad plane will be able to overcome an enemy ace whose machine is technically more sophisticated only on the condition that the latter misses the attack or makes mistakes in the battle. The battle cannot be won by heroism alone. It is hurtful and sad to recall how many of our pilots, brave boys, perished on those battles because their equipment was outmoded. However, the military and technical advantages of the enemy were not the only reasons for the failures of the fighters. However paradoxical it might sound, one of the reasons for the situation that was created turned out to be the tactics themselves. Whose fault is it that the dense combat formations of fighters, the chief of which was the "wedge" of a three-plane flight, was detected by the enemy a long way off, and, most importantly, hindered the actions of the pilots? Whose fault is it that in such combat formations the pilots were forced to stay close to one another, to pay a lot of attention to keeping their place, which led to a reduction in vigilance? These tactical shortcomings were taken advantage of by the Hitlerites for their surprise attacks. But why did this happen? The force of tradition made itself felt. For many years pilots had been taught to wage battle in banked turns, actions in battle formations that were not echeloned by altitude. The war dictated immediate and radical changes in tactics. In the harsh existence of the front, the enemy actions were studied closely, combat experience was accumulated, and there was an intense search for more effective tactical techniques. We will not delve into all the ups and downs of development of tactics in the course of the war, but will mentally shift from these dramatic events to their concluding period. Air superiority, which was first won in individual areas, then in larger ones, finally tended in our favor in air-to-air battles at Kuban, the battle of Kursk (1943), and subsequently was held firmly by Soviet aviation. Mass influx of new fighters to the front -- "Yakovlevs" and "Lavochkins" (fig. 3,4) [not reproduced] stripped the enemy of his former advantages. The dense formations of three-aircraft flights became a thing of the past. The pair was affirmed as basic fire and tactical unit . A battle formation of larger subunits was structured on the basis of pairs and usually consisted of a strike force and escort element or holding force (fig. 5). In an air-to-air battle the strike force played the role of the "sword" (search and attack), and the escort element was its reliable "shield." However small the fighter force was, it would always adhere to the division into "shield" and "sword." If the pilots encountered bombers escorted by fighters, the escort element sought to engage them in battle, and if there were none, they would attack the bombers along with the strike force. The strike was always delivered by those flights and pairs which proved to be in an advantageous position. Figure 5. Battle formation of fighters in expectation of battle The tactics of fighter aviation received further development and were displayed most graphically in the concluding Berlin operation. Air superiority was assured through vigorous actions of fighters in the three main zones (fig. 6). Fighter forces, "hunters" operating in the first zone, reached the fascist airfields and destroyed the scrambling aircraft, sought out and destroyed small groups in the air, and upon encountering large groups would radio information about them, which would be used by fighters in other zones when they joined battle. The massing of forces, good organization of command and control, and high combat activeness of the flight personnel bore fruit: more than half of the combat aircraft belonging to the two German air fleets protecting Berlin were destroyed in air-to-air battles. The effectiveness of each combat sortie rose sharply. Thus the number of sorties of fighters per downed fascist aircraft in 1945 was cut to a third in comparison with 1943, and on the average was 53 as opposed to 156. (TsAMO [Ministry of Defense Central Archives], F. 112, op. 158791, d. 1, l. 65.) Figure 6. Fighter aviation battling for air superiority (from experience in the Berlin Fighter aviation fought for air superiority along with attack and bomber aviation, which delivered massed strikes on aircraft at airfields, destroyed fuel and ammunition depots; long-range aviation operated against facilities of the aviation industry in the deep enemy rear. However, in those years air superiority was won primarily by fighters. It was in air-to-air battles that the greatest harm was inflicted on the enemy and fascist pilots perished or were captured. The advent of nuclear weapons soon after the end of the war radically changed views of the methods of attaining air superiority. Using nuclear missiles it became possible in mere minutes to deliver a strike of enormous destructive force against the most remote airfields. As a result, aviation will suffer losses which may lead to an immediate and sharp change in the correlation of forces. In this regard, many foreign specialists believe that the battle for air superiority may be fought without the active participation of fighter aviation. Such views have long existed, but since they have not been tested in practice, the battle for air superiority has continued in numerous local wars, which were waged using only conventional weapons. And here the role of fighter aviation proved far different from that predicted by the skeptics. Despite their opinion, air-to-air battles developed with new force, and in each subsequent war they acquired new traits. Let us examine how fighter tactics changed from war to war. The first air-to-air battles occurred in the skies of Korea seven years after the end of the Second World War. There the first-generation jet fighters MiG-15 (fig. 7) [not reproduced] and F-86 "Sabre" (fig. 8) [not reproduced] which possessed great subsonic speed, met one another. These battles were marked by the great scope of altitude and the sharply increased speeds of the aircraft, and demonstrated significant changes in tactics in a short time. The fighters of the Korean People's Army (KPA), using the advantages of their aircraft over the "Sabres" in rate of climb, sought to fight using vertical maneuvers, while the American pilots preferred horizontal maneuvers and tried to shift the battles from high altitude to medium and low, where the advantages of the MiG-15 over the "Sabre" were reduced somewhat. However the KPA fighters attacked the adversary from above, from a steep dive, and then, using their exceptional rate of climb, gained altitude sharply and departed into the sun. Combat formations in groups became more and more dispersed, for otherwise they could not provide freedom of maneuver, the parameters of which increased sharply in jet aircraft. (See: Stuart, J. Vozdushnaya moshch -- reshayushaya sila v Koreye [Air Power -- the Decisive Force in Korea], Izd. inostr. lit., 1959, pp 67-68) Another ten years passed. The Vietnam War broke out. The MiG-17 and MiG- 21 (fig. 9,10) [not reproduced] fighters fought air-to-air battles with the F-3 "Phantom" (fig. 11) [not reproduced] under conditions of air superiority for American aviation, and this left an imprint on their tactics. Due to the low numerical strength of the fighter aviation opposing the aggressor, there were no large multiple-aircraft battles. The tactics of the Vietnamese pilots were structured on rapid and surprise attacks by pairs against the most vulnerable American aircraft. Air-to-air battles as a rule consist of one attack, which was performed following commands from ground control points, at maximum speed using the conditions of natural concealment. Such attacks added confusion and bewilderment to the actions of the American pilots. They tried to counter the Vietnamese fighters with various tactical techniques, but nothing new was thought up to evade the attacks except for energetic maneuver. The battles for air superiority in the Arab-Israeli wars took a different course. In comparison with past wars, they were characterized by extensive use of feints and decoy actions, more dispersed combat formations, and increased tactical coordination between fighter subunits. The light maneuver aircraft "Mirage"-3C and the heavier F-4 "Phantom" took part in the air-to-air battles on the aggressor's side. The combat formations, as before, were dispersed and echeloned by altitude. However the disposition of forces had changed (fig. 12). The "Mirage"-3C fighters comprised the group luring the enemy to commit to battle, or decoy element. But the difficulty was that no one could say if this was a decoy or strike element. The tactics were reminiscent of a game of "cat and mouse," except that its outcome was different. The decoy element would approach the battle area at medium altitude, where they were quickly detected by ground radars of the Arabs, fighters were scrambled to intercept, while the strike was concealed at low altitude. When the Arab fighters tried to attack the decoy element, through feints the latter would create favorable conditions for a surprise attack of their strike force, which was invisible to the radar. Figure 12. Air-to-air battle using diversional maneuver In the war in Lebanon (1982), when the Israeli air force was augmented with the more sophisticated American F-15 and F-16 aircraft (fig. 13,14) [not reproduced], the tactics of air-to-air combat received further development (fig. 15). The light F-16 fighters would attack first. Armed with short-range "Sidewinder" missiles, they would covertly join with the Syrian fighters at low altitude from their rear hemisphere. The F-15 fighters, which had intermediate-range "Sparrow" missiles, would strike from long range (25-30 km). Instead of "Mirages," the role of decoy elements would be played by drones, and command and control (target designation, retargeting, buildup of efforts) was provided from airborne command posts, whose role was played by the E-2C "Hawkeye" AWACS aircraft (fig. 16) [not reproduced]. Electronic warfare aircraft also operated in the interests of the fighters. Figure 15. Air-to-air battle of fighters in Lebanon (1982) Today the battles of past years no longer fire our imagination. Much has changed in the disposition of forces and in the tactics themselves of fighter aviation. What is the role of air-to-air battles in the struggle for air superiority today and in the future? Important military leaders and specialists abroad polemicize in their search for answers to this question, and the works of military science institutions are published. No one dares to question the importance of the problem, but all stress its complexity and contradictory nature. In carefully studying the course of air-to-air battles in local wars and comparing their effectiveness with strikes against airfields, some western specialists conclude that under present-day conditions aviation on the ground is still the most vulnerable. This is explained by the fact that the power of strike elements possessing new systems of precision weapons has increased sharply, and modern aircraft are in the limited area of airfields and cannot get along without a runway with a hard artificial pavement, which is easily visible from the air. And if we look at the problem from another aspect? After all, putting aviation at airfields which are in the depth of the enemy territory would be more difficult. The increase in the combat readiness of aviation units and subunits on the one hand, and the increase in the range of detection of the offensive air weapons on the other, has the result that now the time of scrambling the main aviation forces from the airfields is less than the flight time to target of the assault elements of the attacking aviation after their detection. Therefore aircraft can take off from the airfields and escape from the strike before it occurs. It has become more difficult to hurt aviation on the ground, since the planes are generally in quite reliable shelters, and it is more difficult to penetrate the air defense SAM barrier. How should the battle for air superiority be waged so as to bring the greatest success? The final word on this has not been spoken, but clearly, on the basis of the contradictory nature of the problem, one cannot unequivocally approach its resolution: strikes on airfields or air-to-air battles? Too many factors influence the answer. There is basing, composition, and capabilities of aviation to achieve surprise, escape from a strike, the disposition of forces of the sides, and much else. Therefore the specific weight of strikes on airfields and air-to-air battles under various conditions and in different periods of combat actions may change over rather broad limits. But the interrelation and the interdependence of strikes and battles are strengthened under present-day conditions. Thus strikes on airfields, aviation command and control posts, and air defense create favorable conditions for actions of fighters over the adversary's territory and attainment of air superiority in strength, and successful air-to-air battles exert direct influence on the results of strikes on airfields, since the strike aviation is given the opportunity to operate under conditions of weakened enemy resistance. There is another characteristic feature in the combat mission of fighter aviation in the battle for air superiority: its very concept is being expanded. Instead of a battle with the adversary's combat aviation, it includes destruction of early warning aircraft, airborne command posts, and elements of reconnaissance-strike complexes. If all of them patrolling in the air are not quickly destroyed, the enemy will be able to warn his aircraft in time and pull aircraft at airfields away from the strikes, then commit his fighters to battle. And this means that air targets which are diverse in type and nature of actions, the fighters must utilize different tactical techniques in battle. Therefore the battle with such targets is often included among the independent missions of fighter aviation. Thus the battle for air superiority is inevitable, unavoidable, and does not depend on the type of combat action or our wishes, so consequently the air space in the foreseeable future will continue to be the arena for fierce battles and engagements. However, the battle for air superiority could be an independent mission for fighter aviation only in individual local wars. It performs this mission in repelling a surprise enemy incursion, protecting friendly forces, and supporting the combat actions of other aviation arms. Winning and holding air superiority will create favorable conditions and is this a kind of key which opens the way to accomplishment of other tasks? . Fighters and Protected Troops A squadron over a battlefield. The ground heaves from the bursts of shells and mortars. Black columns of smoke from burning tanks rise heavenward. The pilots watch our infantry move forward through the fire, penetrating the smoke, to meet the enemy. Behind it are visible the artillery positions and concentrations of troops -- the targets of strikes by fascist bombers. The fighters race to the attack against nine "Junkers" about to drop their bombs on the protected troops. Then one after the other the enemy bombers burn and fall before the eyes of the infantrymen. The Soviet soldiers had occasion to witness many such battles in the years of the Great Patriotic War. But it was also otherwise, especially at the start of the war, when friendly troops retreated under the onslaught of powerful enemy assault elements. Ask former soldiers if they often saw our fighters in the sky. All would answer "hardly at all." They remember the inordinate load which the unprotected troops experienced, the losses they incurred under the strikes of the fascist aviation because their protection from the air was not reliable enough, or was altogether absent. And this at a time when the adversary's aviation, interacting with ground troops, concentrated its efforts in the axis of their strikes and so "processed" our defense that it could no longer deter the enemy offensive. Significant fighter aviation forces were required to accomplish the most important task of protecting troops, but there were obviously not enough. There were no reliable command and control systems, or the necessary experience. Combined-arms commanders were not sufficiently competent in effective use of the combat capabilities of the fighter aviation. After all, planes in the air are not tanks on the ground. The desire to protect as many targets as possible and uniformly disperse the forces of fighter aviation over the entire front led to their scattering, and hampered massing and maneuver. But now imagine that the pilots had to detect and attack the enemy before he delivered strikes on the protected troops. Although the easily based fighters of those years were disposed on small dirt airfields, at times right next to the front line, they by no means always had time for the sortie. For timely interception of the adversary, airborne alert duty was organized, but it was necessary to protect the troops for long periods, and the time the pilots were in the zones was 40-50 minutes. Requiring great expenditures of forces, motor operating time, and fuel, this mode of combat action condemned the fighters to passivity. Taking advantage of the fact that they were tied down to specific areas, the enemy could keep them busy in battle, or simply bypass these areas. So what was left for the commanders to do who were responsible for protecting the troops? Either intercept from alert status on the ground, which did not allow a timely attack on the enemy, or airborne alert duty, by which you also gain little. There remained the sole correct way in the prevailing circumstances: improve resources and the system of command and control. Meanwhile actual effectiveness at times did not correspond to best intentions. Only later, when radar entered the air forces, did this way bring perceptible results, and make it possible to abandon the continuous airborne alert duty. Commitment of fighters to battle from alert status on the ground became the basic method of combat action in protecting troops. Control of the fighters was implemented using radars, which in 1943 were introduced into the equipment tables of air armies and assigned to the fighter aviation corps. In 1944, 2,102 fighters were vectors to aerial targets from radar data, and 1,262 enemy aircraft were shot down. (See: Timokhovich, I.V. Operativnoye iskusstvo Sovetskikh VVS v Velikoy Otechestvennoy Voynye [Operational Art of Soviet Air Forces in the Great Patriotic War], M.: Voyenizdat, 1976, 283 pages.) In addition, in order to beat the adversary to the punch in actions, the most proficient pilots began to enter his territory to areas where flights of fascist aircraft had been noted. Thus appeared, or more precisely was reborn, another method of combat action well known in Russian aviation, which was dubbed the "roving patrol." This method was very effective, but not the main one. Actions of the "hunters" were not tied to specific protected installations, and of course could not ensure reliability. The "hunters" were free in their choice of time, routes, and mission profile. Operating in individual pairs, they inconspicuously crossed the front line at sectors where troop actions were less vigorous, encountered enemy aircraft at remote approaches to the protected installations, closed with them covertly, and launched surprise attacks. Actions of the "hunters" kept the Hitlerites in a constant state of tension, and sowed panic. High tactical proficiency was required of our pilots. The renowned aces recounted how carefully they prepared for each flight on the "hunt, and developed tactical techniques for search and battle in the depth of enemy territory. By the end of the war the fighter aviation possessed adequate forces to protect troops, and a well-organized system of warning and command and control of fighters had developed, thanks to which the enemy aircraft were detected 12-15 minutes before the approach to protected troops. Command posts were able to commit new forces ahead of time, create numerical superiority over the adversary in decisive axes, and in the necessary time. Systematically and consistently the fighter aviation protected troops in areas of concentration, in staging areas for attack with breakthrough the enemy defense, and then shifted efforts to protection of mobile groups with their commitment to battle, and actions in the operational depth. Interception of the adversary from a ground alert status was intelligently combined with interception from airborne alert status and "roving patrol." Each of the modes of combat action of fighter infantry was necessary in its own way, convenient, and supplemented the others. These modes have been retained to this day. Which of them should be preferred today? I do not believe this is an easy question, or that many of us could give a detailed answer to it. There are reasons for this: --the troops as an object of protection have changed, the stability of their defense, the depth of disposition of combat formations, the mobility and fire power of air defense weapons, the capacity to quickly shift from defensive to counteroffensive actions, have changed; --the range of protected targets against which the air adversary may deliver strikes, in the most remote areas using long-range precision weapons, has grown; --dimensions of airspace surveyed by modern ground radars and airborne weapons radars have grown. And now let us consider how these three essentially contradictory circumstances affect the choice of modes of combat action of fighter aviation. Obviously the first of them entails an increase in the dimensions of the required areas of protection of troops, a more dynamic situation than in the past, and the need to allow for the capabilities of ground air defense weapons; the second makes the troops more vulnerable, increases the importance and complexity of the given combat mission of the fighter aviation; and the third widens the capabilities of intercept of the adversary at remote perimeters. The latter circumstance demands clarification: at what distance from protected targets must fighters need to and have to intercept air targets? Figure 17. Required points of engagement of fighters when protecting troops Let us begin with the obvious (fig. 17). If enemy aircraft deliver a strike on targets with conventional uncontrolled bombs, then distance from the targets is characterized by the amount of carry of the bombs A, which all things being equal increases with increased velocity and altitude of their release, reaching values of several tens of kilometers. But the range of launch of air-to-ground missiles is already measured in hundreds of kilometers. Now we add these ranges to the dimensions of the targets to be protected rb, add radius of effect with nuclear or precision weapons Rp, and we determine the required range of the line of engagement of the adversary by the formula Sp = A + rb + Rp The lines thus calculated are essentially the final lines of destruction of the adversary. And this means the fighters must be committed to battle at a range (Sb) which ensures they can fight before the adversary reaches the lines we have calculated: Sb = V x tb. Now let us proceed to determine rational modes of combat action of fighter aviation from the other aspect. We will formulate two very important questions. The first is, will the fighters have time to meet the adversary at such remote lines? And second, what should be done all the same, if the answer to the first question is negative? Clearly the points of engagement shown in fig. 17, guaranteeing safety of protected targets, are closely associated with the lines of detection of the adversary. They are separated by a distance which he covers in the time spent by the fighters on commitment to battle from the ground alert duty status or while in the air. Now let us turn to the circumstances noted above, and solve the following problem. Let us assume that you are the commander. You have fighters at an airfield in full readiness to take off. The dimensions of your area of troop protection are large, and the adversary can use long-range missiles, but the range of his detection is adequate for timely interception. Clearly there is nothing to mull over, and you will make your decision for simultaneous or successive commitment of fighters to battle from ground alert status at predetermined lines. Yet another exercise. You are the commander. The conditions are the same, but the adversary has been smart, and taking advantage of low altitude and tactical tricks, has been able to reduce the range of his detection. What should be done? You would like to intercept him with fighters on airfield alert duty. Of course you will estimate their capabilities to reduce the takeoff time, you may be saved by commitment of fighters to the battle in the forward hemisphere of the targets (a 180-degree turn and pursuit will become unnecessary), but you might not too. Clearly you cannot manage without airborne alert duty here. A final example. You are a pilot who detects a target at a given line, but it is maneuvering and using jamming. Can you shoot it down before it uses its long-range weapons? After all, the depth of the air-to-air battle is growing. Is there a solution? There is. As before, it consists of a reasonable combination of modes of combat action. This does not allow us to ignore airborne alert, although its cost continues to be very high: sortie requirements are quickly expended, and the flight personnel rapidly exhausted. What is the attitude of fighter aviation today to the "roving patrol?" Does this mode have a right to life, or is it an anachronism? After all, present-day control equipment and systems provide for vectoring of fighters from ground and airborne command posts against a quite large number of targets. The needs for "roving patrols" are not limited, and it is scarcely necessary to use them in the same value as in the years of the Great Patriotic War. But anything can happen in a combat situation: the adversary may deliver a strike on command and control posts, apply electronic jamming, infiltrate decoy groups of aircraft at different altitudes. And then the fighters will again resort to the old but tested mode, which has been called "independent search and destruction of aerial targets (hunt)." The area of application of this mode is quite great. It makes it possible to intercept the adversary not only in a difficult situation but also at maximum distance from the protected targets, at low altitudes, where the best radars are helpless. Fighters with weapons radars and powerful long-range weapons will become a serious hazard to enemy aircraft in the depth of his territory. Therefore. independent search and destruction of targets is a mode of combat action which has not become a thing of the past, has not become outmoded. It continues to be relevant and is provided for in the combat regulations of the air forces of many countries. As in the past, pilots search in the assigned areas in likely directions of flight of the adversary, using weapons radars and visual sighting. They are given complete freedom of action, but such fighter tactics encounter a number of problems: how to achieve secrecy of action over enemy territory, if it is covered by a continuous radar field; how to overcome the resistance of enemy air defense, and to avoid the destructive fire in continues zones of engagement of SAMs; how to be the first to detect high-speed targets and assume a favorable position for their attack without using ground or airborne command posts. Alas, these problems have not been resolved even today. But then, the solution also depends on us. Thus, without laying claim to specific conclusions regarding the role and place of modes of combat action of fighter aviation in protecting troops under different conditions, let us try to imagine the following picture. Fighters are assigned the mission of protecting troops. In making his decision, the commander, of course, allows for the expected nature of enemy actions, the possible range of his detection, the dimensions of the protected area, and marks off the points of engagement and zones of alert duty of the fighters (if they are not determined by the senior officer). He will not forget to also asses the composition of his own forces, and the capabilities of the system of command and control, i.e., everything on which his choice of modes of combat action will depend. Upon receiving information on an impending mass raid, in accordance with his decision the commander puts the fighters in immediate readiness for takeoff, and if timely interception of targets at the planned lines is not assured (for example at low altitudes) he scrambles some of his forces to alert zones. Some minutes later, the other subunits begin to take off according to plans. They are given the mission of building up efforts of the earlier-scrambled fighters, concentrating them to destroy the most dangerous targets in the enemy grouping. Here there may be various surprises (unfavorable correlation of forces, unforeseen maneuver of individual targets, unsuccessful attacks of friendly pilots), and the command cannot manage without a reserve, which may be on the ground or in the air. Leaving their airfield behind them, and then even their troops, the pilots go further to the set lines. They know that now the main thing is not to permit enemy strikes with long-range precision weapons against the protected targets. Then the first aircraft appear. The air-to-air battle begins. Protection of troops continues. The enemy aircraft approach the zones of destruction of the SAM systems. The fighters must fight the battle in close coordination with them. How can their joint efforts be coordinated? How can fighters ensure their safety in zones of engagement of SAM complexes? We will return to these questions in chapter IV. The raid is repelled, but the threat remains. You see, the enemy will shift to echeloned actions with small groups and individual planes. Here is just the place for independent search and destruction of air targets. The main forces of fighters will restore combat readiness for repeat sorties, but at this same time pair after pair of "hunters" will take off and proceed to the enemy rear. However, our commander has not allowed for one serious circumstance, which escapes him in the earlier prevailing stereotypes. You see, protection of troops today is one of the components of accomplishing the general mission of foiling an enemy invasion. Here fighter aviation faces a completely new contradiction, arising from the essence of defensive military doctrine. On the one hand, fighters must intercept the air enemy at the far approaches to the protected targets, in order to prevent their launch of air-to-ground missiles, and, on the other, the points of engagement are bounded by the state border until the fact of attack becomes obvious. But this is still not all. For some amount of time the protected troops will be forced to repel the attack of the adversary, and then shift to counteroffensive actions. Thus organization of protection and modes of combat action of fighter aviation vary according to the conditions of the ground situation. How can we compensate for these unfavorable factors? They confront commanders of all levels with the urgent need to have significant forces of fighters in the optimal combat readiness to protect troops, to execute maneuvers along the front and in depth to create the necessary correlation of forces in areas where destruction of enemy aircraft before their launch of missiles is still possible. Proceeding from the NATO concept of "engaging second echelons (reserves)" troops must be protected to the entire depth of their disposition. Thus protection of troops remains a most important combat mission of fighter aviation, which it accomplishes with diverse modes of combat actions. The use of flexible tactics makes it possible for the fighters to intercept the adversary at any altitude, in any portion of the protected region, to quickly concentrate efforts in remote approaches to the targets, and to act beyond the limits of the continuous field of friendly radar. 3. Supporting Other Aviation Arms "I receive the mission with a group of pilots accompanying the `Petlyakovs' (Pe-2 -- diver bomber). We fly to the region of Belgorod to bomb the enemy airfield, where his `Junkers' are based. The commander warned us that the airfield was strongly defended by antiaircraft artillery, and there were `Messerschmitts' on patrol aloft. Soon the group of bombers approached the airfield. We took off at their signal. I had to attentively watch the sky and structure the combat formation so that the German AA gunners could not separate us from the `Petlyakovs.' The main goal was to hit the airfield. Now it was ahead of us. At the edge was a group of Junkers. The Pe-2 dropped their bombs on the move. The smoke from the explosions covered the airfield. The Junkers took off in disarray. And our bombers and fighters attacked them at takeoff, destroying them in the air. The commander of the group of Petlyakovs radioed me that the mission was accomplished, it was time to go home. I ordered the fighters to cover the group of Petlyakovs with special care from the flanks, where the bombers were more vulnerable. We left the airfield quickly, disappearing as suddenly as we had appeared." (Kozhedub, I.--"Vernost Otchiznye" [Loyalty to the Fatherland], M.: Voyenizdat, 1975, pp 202-204.) This excerpt from the memoirs of three-time Hero of the Soviet Union I. Kozhedub uses the example of just one frontline episode to show the content of the main method of combat actions of fighters in supporting other aviation arms in the Great Patriotic War, direct escort to the target and back. In those years subunits and units which required protection flew themselves to the fighter airfield or met them at a set line, and then flew together, repelling attacks on the fighters by enemy fighters. In turn the crews of the protected aircraft used radio, signal flares, or tracers to inform the fighters of the appearance of the enemy, and jointly with them delivered fire on the enemy aircraft with their onboard weapons. In preparing for a sortie to protect bombers, lines were determined for the start and stop of the escort, formation of a common battle formation, procedures of action when encountering enemy fighters. At the same time, in order to raise reliability of protection at the approach of the bombers to the targets, where they usually encountered intensive resistance from enemy fighters, provision was made for timely arrival of some of our fighters at these targets, racing ahead of the protected aircraft. In addition to bombers, attack aircraft, which delivered strikes on enemy troops, also required reliable protection from enemy fighters. Coordinating units often were deployed at the same airfield or were neighbors. This offered broad opportunities for personal contacts to clarify details of the coordination. When protecting attack aircraft, the fighters usually formed two groups: a strike force, which followed behind and above the protected aircraft at the limits of visibility, and a local protection force, which was on the flanks and behind the attack aircraft (fig. 18). Upon approach to the target, the strike force repelled attacks by enemy fighters trying to impede the strike, and engaged them in battle if they patrolled over the target. The local protection force drew away the attack of those fighters which broke through to the attack aircraft through the barrier of the strike force, and if possible jointly with the attack aircraft they suppressed the fire of the enemy antiaircraft battery. Figure 18. Fighter cover of Il-2 ground-attack aircraft during the Great Patriotic War These tactics of fighters in protecting bombers and attack aircraft were retained through the entire war. The details might change, but the characteristic features remained joint combat formations, close coordination with protected aircraft, attachment of the fighters to them, and defensive battle. Joint combat formations strengthened crew confidence in safety of their actions, promoted successful repulse of enemy attacks, and allowed them to concentrate attention on searching for targets and striking at them. But although fighters over enemy territory could not count on information about the air situation from the ground, and the buildup of forces in battle, they operated ably and resolutely, bravely closed with the enemy, and swiftly attacked him, not allowing him to get through to the protected aircraft. Later on, with an increase in the numerical strength of fighter aviation, it began to practice a combination of modes of combat action. In addition to forces allocated for escort, groups were created to clear away enemy fighters, which left for the target region 10 to 15 minutes before the start of the strike and joint battle with them (sweep of air space). Groups were also formed to blockade airfields of enemy fighters, and reserve groups. They all operated according to a single plan during delivery of massed strikes by aviation. However, the main mode of combat actions remained direct escort of attack aircraft and bombers, which achieved a high level of sophistication. Preparation of fighters to perform the missions was carried out jointly with the crews of supported aircraft and ended with a joint rehearsal of the combat flight, and after landing a similar general critique was conducted. If possible the fighters were based with attack aircraft at the same airfield. In the postwar years, the importance of such effective escort decreased. As early as the Korean war, despite the allocation of a significant amount of fighter aviation forces, the U.S. bombers escorted by it suffered heavy losses. Thus in just one raid (30 October 1951), in which eight B-29 bombers and 90 escort fighters participated, pilots of the Korean People's Army destroyed all the bombers. (NEWSWEEK, 1961, 30 November). Subsequently, the cases of high bomber losses became more frequent. Not without surprise, foreign military specialists conclude that this was not a regrettable exception from the law-governed regularities of tactics, but rather a law-governed regularity itself: direct escort had not justified itself. The prevailing situation had two causes: the growth in speeds and parameters of maneuver was making itself felt more and more in joint flight. Analyzing frontline examples (fig.18), one can see that fighters executing an energetic maneuver did not lose visual contact with the protected group. They had a great advantage in speed over them, could shift freely from one flank to the other, and concentrate forces in the threatened axis. With the decrease in speed differences and increase in maneuver parameters, the situation changed. In addition it became more difficult for the fighters to be at intervals and separations of certain visual observations of the protected aircraft. Therefore, they were forced to pay more attention to visual contact with them than to the search for the air enemy. But most importantly, being tied down in this way deprived the pilots of the initiative, the choice of the favorable moment to join battle, and freedom of maneuver. Indeed, just as a sentry cannot leave his post and go away from the protected installation, an escort fighter cannot abandon his place in the battle formation. But even a simple turn of 180 degrees would separate the fighter from the group. The pilots were told to join battle only in the event of urgent necessity, to execute short maneuvers in order to be able to resume their place in the combat formation. Any decoy actions, feints and other tactical techniques were ruled out, but all this did not solve the problem. A little later the capabilities for direct escort were narrowed even more. This time the reason was the entry of air-to-air guided missiles into the armament of the enemy fighters. They had a range of launch much exceeding the range of visual contact of the fighters with their supported aircraft. For timely repulse of attacks by an enemy using such missiles, it was necessary to dispose the escort fighters beyond visual contact with the strike forces. But the advent of all-aspect missiles led to the need to defend them from all directions. Direct escort was transformed into patrol escort. The transition to patrol escort somewhat broadened the capabilities of the fighters, but the basic drawbacks (being tied to their place in the battle formation, constricted maneuver) remained. In addition, in order to control a common battle formation, in which the separations and intervals significantly exceeded the range of visibility, required the assistance of control points from the ground, which became impossible over enemy territory. Therefore, hopes for patrol escort proved to be vain, but leaving bombers without fighters following them was even worse. What next? Before answering, let us trace how conditions change for providing protection of subunits and units of strike aviation with fighter forces. New aircraft entering its armament had higher performance in terms of speed and altitude, and adequate power plant. This allowed them to fly to targets at high speed and maneuver in a great range of altitudes. But fighters protecting bombers continued to be restricted in maneuver; in particular it was necessary to repel attacks of enemy aircraft armed with guided missiles, from great range. Therefore some aviation commanders, assuming that high speed, maneuverability, and a great range of flight altitudes had become the basic protection from enemy fighters, wondered if protection of strike aviation by the forces of fighter aviation was necessary at all. It is not hard to see that the proponents of such views in fact were denying not the need for protection of strike aviation, but only one of the modes of combat action of fighters, escort. The traditional mode of fighter escort of aircraft of tactical and strategic aviation convincingly demonstrated it weak points back in the Vietnam war. The American press reported that these aircraft, flying with a high bombing payload, could not maintain a speed of more than 890 km/hr, and, despite their escort by fighters en route and in the target region, were very vulnerable to North Vietnamese fighters. Diving through the battle formations of escort fighters at supersonic speed, they confidently downed the protected aircraft. Although the American pilots knew about this tactical technique, they had a difficult time countering it. (ORDNANCE, 1976, No 11-12). Later on the Americans changed to supporting strike aircraft not only by an escort but also by sending out screening elements, through patrols of long-range intercept forces in the axes of possible appearance of enemy fighters, and also by bottling up their airfields (fig. 19). All tactical groups move initially in a common battle formation, and then, moving ahead of the strike forces, they assume a position shown in the figure. Figure 19. Fighter support of other aviation arms (from experience of Vietnam War). Tactical I know that in analyzing figure 19, some readers will smile skeptically: could we use the experience of Vietnam today? There an aggressor possessing a significant superiority over the North Vietnamese air forces could so lavishly expend his own fighter forces. What place is there for escort, even patrol escort, if there is no such superiority? For an answer to these questions, let us turn to more recent events. Ten years later in the Lebanon conflict of 1982, Israeli F-15 and F-16 fighters abandoned their joint flights and any contact with strike groups. In place of the traditional escort, so inconvenient for the fighters, interaction with them occurred in the time and along lines at the boundaries of the strike region. Before arrival of the strike forces at the targets, the fighters moved forward and formed multi-tiered screens. There was one other factor promoting such actions. This entire region was under radar surveillance from an airborne command post (E-2C Hawkeye), which monitored the air situation and corrected the actions of the strike forces and fighter cover. Today those problems which were resolved in protecting strike forces in local wars, are history, are partially forgotten and overshadowed by new problems. The increase in capabilities of strike aviation, but mainly the changed conditions of combat action due to the demands of defensive doctrine, have exerted a definitive influence on their onset. While complying with the principle of defensive sufficiency, which provides for the minimal necessary amount of military equipment and personnel to repel a possible aggression, despite the high performance of the aircraft, the proficiency and vigilance of the commanders, one cannot count on superiority of forces. In addition, when delivering a retaliatory-meeting strike or retaliatory strike, aviation will meet the resistance of an unsuppressed or weakly suppressed enemy air defense system and its fighters. So what today is the role of fighter aviation, given the current level and quality of aviation equipment, what modes can ensure successful protection of strike aviation operating en masse in dispersed battle formations, using long-range precision weapons and powerful EW equipment? The growing danger to strike aviation from enemy fighters on the one hand, and the high combat properties of fourth-generation fighters on the other, undoubtedly will raise the role of fighter aviation, but depend on further improvement in the modes of its combat action. One can scarcely assume that all is evident here. After all, the search for new ways in any sphere of activity is always associated with resolution of a number of problems. In the sphere of protection of strike aviation by fighter forces, today one can discern at least three primary problems: - How to eliminate the element of "delay" inherent in the nature of defense, and ensure adequate readiness of fighter aviation (and of strike aviation) for protection in multivariant conditions? Unreadiness, slowness to make decisions or to scramble fighters may lead to a loss of combat capacity even before the start of a retaliatory strike. - How to ensure electronic compatibility of onboard electronics of the protected aircraft and the weapons radars of the fighters? The weakly perceptible interference to weapons radars in protecting individual small groups of bombers proves significantly stronger in massed strikes of aviation, when it operates in large groups, and [such interference] may seriously complicate the air situation for the covering fighters. - How to protect aircraft of strike aviation, and particularly those of long-range aviation, delivering strikes on remote targets deep in the enemy rear? The first of these problems is resolved in the general context of raising the combat readiness of fighter aviation to repel aggression, the second is a field for military engineer solutions, the third deserves detailed discussion. We know that until recently protection of long-range aircraft was possible only when they were flying through the pre-frontal zone. The reason for this was the comparatively small tactical radius of action of the fighters. Then the bombers had to overcome the enemy air defense independently, relying on their onboard EW equipment and defensive armament. With the advent of Su-27s, which one can rightly call long-range fighters (maximum flight range 4,000 km), in the fighter armament, the situation has now changed. Potential opportunities have appeared for protection of aviation en route to the targets to the launch lines of air-to-surface missiles and back. To a significant degree the capabilities designed into different aircraft systems to observe the air space, determine the relative coordinates of the fighters and the protected aircraft at long range, and the capabilities of commanders to control wingmen in a multiple-aircraft air-to-air battle have been enhanced. However, potential opportunities are still not reality. In order to realize them, it is necessary to develop the most beneficial modes and variants of fight at various altitudes, and in the future to assimilate airborne refueling of fighters, and, no less important, high proficiency and training of pilots, their ability to take full advantage of the new capabilities of the equipment. But this is only one aspect of the problem. There is another. The increase in range and the duration of flight has a negative influence on the functional state and working capacity of the crews of all aircraft, especially one-seaters. It becomes ever more difficult to "conquer space and time." But the literature devoted to such questions still modestly avoids this aspect. But can one fail to allow for such negative factors as hypodynamia, long hours spent in the flight gear and special equipment in a constricted working posture, the impossibility of meeting natural needs, etc. After all, this leads to muscle fatigue, the onset of painful sensations, reduction in activeness of mental processes. And this in the depth of enemy territory, where the air situation is filled to the limit with critical, stressful situations, and where complications cannot be avoided without maintaining the work capacity of the pilots at the very highest level! Further automation of the processes of aircraft and weapons control, development of combat decision-making algorithms in standard situations, the inculcation in the pilots of high morale, aggressiveness, and psychological qualities, prevention of discomfort -- compliance with the preflight regimen of rest and nourishment, the choice of size and adjustment of the flight gear, creation of special medications, urinals... one can enumerate and enumerate such measures for escape from a critical situation. But we are more interested in the development of modes of combat action of fighter aviation in protecting strike aviation. Indisputably we cannot discard the experience of the past, and of exercises conducted in our times. This experience, with allowance for the capabilities of modern fighter aircraft, shows that a concentration of efforts of fighter aviation on the protection not of individual groups, but of the entire aviation element in the air, in accordance with its operational-tactical structure, with strict delimitation of actions in terms of time and lines, is most preferable. Here, within the framework of the air strike to be delivered, and for its entire depth, the fighter groups can move in an echelon to break through the air defenses, sweeping the air space, and combine this mode of combat action with screens in the air. The latter can move in the direction of the airfields from which the appearance of enemy fighters is expected. Such a combination of modes of combat action to some degree promotes economy of fighter forces, and consequently corresponds to the principle of defensive sufficiency. As for patrol escort of strike forces, although it is being improved on a new basis, it requires the recruitment of large fighter forces, and can be adequately effective when there are reliable resources for observation of the air situation and control of the fighters (e.g., AWACS planes), and also when good electronic compatibility of avionics of the protected aircraft and fighters is achieved. It goes without say that along with improvement of these traditional modes of combat action of fighter aviation, the very conditions of protection force a new look at the capabilities of fighters, and a quest for other modes. One of them might be decoy (distracting) actions of small forces (pairs, flights) of fighters over a wide front, in order to complicate the enemy's air situation and scatter efforts of manpower and resources of his air defense. Routes, altitudes, and time of flight of the fighters should be chosen so that the enemy cannot retarget his fighters, scrambling to intercept decoys, against strike forces. Maneuvering energetically, they will also help aviation to overcome SAM resistance, which constitutes no less of a threat to it. But it is important that fighters operating as decoy elements also have equipment to generate active and passive jamming. So what combination of modes of combat action should we consider to be rational? It all depends on the specific situation. Let us assume that the fighters are given the mission of supporting the combat actions of a subunit or unit in delivery of a strike against a target in the depth of enemy territory. Will the protected aircraft operate at high altitude or low outside the zones of visibility of ground radars, over a region with strong enemy air defense, or in a zone where it is suppressed? What resistance is expected from enemy fighters, will friendly forces be enough for a patrol escort? All these and other factors of the situation must be taken into account by the commander making the decision. However, in all cases he must precisely coordinate the actions of his different tactical forces with the actions of the supported subunit or unit, clarify the route, the mission profile, the time of takeoff and arrival at the target of the strike, procedures for flight to the target and over the target. Otherwise, even the best modes of combat action of the fighters will have little effectiveness. Here one should allow for one other circumstance. One has to be a great optimist to assume that by attacking first the aggressor will not be able to put out of commission the great part of the fighter control posts, create gaps in the continuous radar field of the defending side. Therefore, while in the past integrated use of modes of combat action were planned for over the enemy territory, now it becomes necessary also over friendly forces, with minimal participation of ground posts in command and control. Further development of the modes of combat action of fighter aviation is a continuous process, reflecting complex, largely contradictory and still unsettled tendencies in the nature of use of strike aviation, in the improvement of the air defense system opposing it, and in the growth of combat capabilities of the fighters themselves. I will not take the risk of making such predictions. The influence of many factors still remains unknown, and now only some of them can be designated, for example: - How to protect aircraft of strike aviation from prospective tactical fighters, armed with long and intermediate range missiles, capable of launching them simultaneously against several bombers. - How to protect aircraft with reduced signatures, developed by low- signature technology ("stealth" technology, as it is called abroad), without giving them away by one's own position. All this testifies to the fact that the modes of combat action of fighter aviation in protecting strike aviation are again on the eve of changes. 4. In Aerial Reconnaissance A pair of YaK-7 fighters took off for reconnaissance of fascist tanks. The adversary was protecting the region of their concentration with antiaircraft weapons, and his fighters patrolled continuously in the air. Under such conditions, it was hard for the multi-seat scout aircraft to penetrate to the target. That was the way fighters were doing the reconnaissance. The front line was crossed. The pair leader scrutinized the winding ribbons of country roads and woods while the wingman watched the sky. Steep climb, dive, turn left, right... There were the block boxes, hiding at the woodline. There were many of them, they were camouflaged and hard to see, but the leader made a count. The air defense gunners were quiet, apparently so as not to give away the position of the tanks, but the wingman saw four Messerschmitts which were already turning for the attack. The scouts could not get tied up in battle. Ably maneuvering, the escaped their pursuit. However, back home quickly with the valuable information... Fighter/scouts conducted aerial reconnaissance in the tactical depth of the enemy chiefly through visual observation. They moved to their reconnaissance targets covertly and unexpected. The proximity of basing to the front line, and the flight speed, higher than that of the multi-seater scout planes, allowed the fighters to rapidly perform the aerial reconnaissance and return to their airfield, although even before the war it was thought that fighter aviation could be called on to perform aerial reconnaissance only if it did not harm accomplishment of basic combat missions. At the start of the war, when our reconnaissance aviation suffered heavy losses, the reconnaissance data of the fighters was successively used to deliver crushing strikes on the enemy. "The scout himself has a hard time determining the value of the information he brings sometimes," three-time Hero of the Soviet Union A. Pokryshkin recalled one of his scouting sorties in November 1941, when large forces of Hitlerites in Von Kleist's tank group managed to evade surveillance of our reconnaissance. "But the grouping of German tanks that I found proved such an important `find' that they talked about it in the staff for a whole week... Kleist's group did not succeed in delivering the surprise strike on our troops." (Pokryshkin, A.I. Nebo voyny [The Skies of War], M.: Voyenizdat, 1966, p 158.) Many such episodes also occurred in the subsequent war years. Fighter/scouts of the 163rd Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment in the Belorussian offensive operation on 1 July 1944 detected about 600 to 700 vehicles, more than 800 carts, and up to 20,000 hitleites at the crossing of the Berezina river in the region of Shevernychi. This sortie had very important consequences. "I will always remember the terrible pictures of our destruction," testified one imprisoned fascist soldier after they were subjected to a fierce air strike based on reconnaissance data. (TsAMO, F. 319, op. 4798, d. 186, l. 18; op. 4800, d. 71, l. 184.) The development of tactics of aerial reconnaissance was dynamic and at times unpredictable in the postwar years. Its conditions and capabilities changed rapidly, but tactical techniques of fighters were always aimed at resolving two interrelated problems: uncovering the targets of reconnaissance, which were becoming smaller and smaller, and mobile, and overcoming the resistance of the enemy air defense, which was growing swiftly with the advent of all-weather interceptors and SAMs. Uncovering small and camouflaged targets posed a special difficulty for the fighters. In contrast to the specialized scout planes, they did not have different kinds of reconnaissance equipment on board, and therefore could not detect objects from their IR radiation, operation or electronic equipment, and other such tell-tale signs. As in the war years, the basic method of aerial reconnaissance for the fighters was visual observation. But with the transition of fighter aviation from piston to jet aircraft, the time of possible observation of targets, especially at low altitude, was sharply reduced, and the maneuverability of the fighters was degraded. In the time spent in executing turns, steep climbs, which now had significantly greater spatial dimensions, the scouts drew further away from their targets than they had previously. Overcoming enemy air defense in aerial reconnaissance is unavoidable, since the fighters have to enter enemy territory. With distance from friendly forces, they were no longer observed by command and control post radars, and therefore were deprived of the opportunity of receiving specific commands for evasion of antiaircraft fire and to avoid encountering enemy fighters. Thus fighters did not have time to search for and identify targets at low altitude, and switching to medium and high altitudes increased their vulnerability to enemy air defense assets. It was necessary to find a solution to the prevailing contradiction, and it was found chiefly through the development of new types of maneuvers. One of them is shown in figure 20. Figure 20. High-speed reconnaissance of small objective The fighters would approach the target at extremely low altitude, concealing themselves in the terrain relief, and conducted observation using a climbing turn, examining the target in the direction of the turn (fig. 20a). The observation time was increased, but if it was not possible to completely uncover the target and "tie" it to the map, the observation was continued in a climbing spiral (fig. 20b). This maneuver was simultaneously an evasion of antiaircraft fire. Let us move on to today. In studying the experience of local wars, western military specialists believe that it is almost impossible for aerial scouts to achieve surprise when flying in a continuous radar field of the adversary, so they concluded that maximal involvement of fighters in aerial reconnaissance was necessary, due to their capablity of operating in a difficult combat environment more successfully than other aircraft. In their opinion, fighter/scouts could be assigned to obtain data about the enemy on the battlefield, and in the tactical depth in the interests of ground forces, and also followup reconnaissance of targets before delivery of strikes, and guidance of aviation strike forces to the targets they detect. Here it was recommended that fighters be assigned acquisition of reconnaissance data in those cases when great precision of information was not necessary, or if it was necessary to check dubious data, clarify information about targets detected by other types of reconnaissance. (Signal, 1984, No. 1). So what are the tactics of fighter/scouts today? They generally operate in pairs. The basic method of reconnaissance remains the traditional visual observation. However with the increased complexity of conditions and targets of reconnaissance, a tendency toward supplementing this method with others has been noted: aerial photography and the use of electronics. For this the fighters may carry suspended containers with photographic, IR, and optoelectronic apparatus, the makeup of which is determined before takeoff in accordance with the content of the assigned reconnaissance mission. Clearly the integrated use of methods of aerial reconnaissance expands the possibilities of the fighters to accomplish it, allows them to accomplish more difficult and extensive tasks, but the search for targets has by no means become less difficult. It suffices to put a canopy-type cover over the target, to lay down a smokescreen, or simply to light a fire nearby, and the target will become invisible to photographic or IR equipment. The search for camouflaged targets therefore still demands the appropriate tactical techniques and a combination of them with techniques for overcoming enemy air defense. The scouts are forced to constantly change course, to execute maneuvers to avoid fighters, foil missile guidance, and all this must not interfere with observation of the targets. There are more than enough techniques of aerial reconnaissance, but their general features include energetic maneuvering in the horizontal and vertical planes, arrival at targets from extremely low altitude, and from axes not expected by the enemy, the use of the weak aspects of his air defense. But this means that fighter/scouts must study the situation in detail in which they must operate, know how to find their bearings well in the terrain, know the tell-tale signs of various targets, where they are located, their status and nature of functioning. These demands were also imposed on fighter/scouts in the past, but today other and higher demands are imposed on them, as on other aerial scouts. This is understandable. The problem of providing complete and reliable information to troops and aviation has become too difficult and multi-faceted, the number of targets has grown sharply, and they must be observed with great frequency. It is not worth considering all the requirements affecting aerial reconnaissance as a whole; I shall allow myself to dwell only on one, the most important of them -- timeliness of reconnaissance. Even the most complete and reliable data cannot be used if they arrive late. Enemy missile complexes discovered by scouts can fire their missiles, enemy aircraft can take off from airfields before strikes can be made against them. And indeed, other targets in the time from their detection until the delivery of strikes against them can change their location, the strike forces must spend a long time looking for them, structure additional maneuvers for the strike, and this leads to loss of surprise and the negative consequences that entails. Aerial reconnaissance undoubtedly is a specific task demanding special training of flight personnel, and it is assigned chiefly to non-organic, pre-trained subunits of fighters. However it would not be excessive for all pilots to constantly train at the conduct of en-route aerial reconnaissance. Lofty responsibility is placed on fighters in the conduct of reconnaissance. For the pilots' commanders organizing it expect speed of action both in the acquisition and in the delivery of data. Decisions are made on their basis, troops go into battle, aviation is scrambled from airfields. The more dynamic and tense the situation, the stronger the weapons, and the greater the damage they may inflict on the enemy, the higher responsibility of scouts for undelivered strikes, or strikes delivered against decoy targets. In order to reduce the time required for reconnaissance, fighters are on alert duty at airfields, in constant readiness for sortie, and in the most tense periods of combat action, may pull alert duty in the air (zones). But even these measures may prove insufficient. With further intensification of demands for timeliness of reconnaissance, the issue will be combining it with strikes against detected targets. This means that fighter/scouts must know how to precisely and accurately destroy ground targets. 5. Fire Crowns the Reconnaissance The mission was an urgent one: the squadron of Yak-7 fighters was to deliver a strike on a column of Hitlerite vehicles and infantry based on the data of aerial reconnaissance. The column was a large one, no less than 120 units. Detected by scouts some 15-20 minutes earlier, it was moving swiftly westward. In addition there were woods all around, and the fascists could camouflage themselves. There was no time to lose, and the squadron was already in the air. Its battle formation, according to the commander's decision, consisted of a strike force and a covering force. By relieving one another, they could take turns attacking the target and provide mutual protection from enemy fighters. The leader saw the target from far off, a long line of vehicles on a narrow road. A steep turn and the pilots raced to the attack against the vanguard of the column. Fire! The lead vehicles blazed up and poured out smoke, an enormous "plug" formed on the road, which had no detours, and more and more vehicles drew up. The covering force replaced the strike force... This episode occurred on 12 July 1944 in the Belorussian offensive operation. (TsAMO, F. 319, op. 4798, d. 186, l. 19-20). At that time the Soviet air forces had long held air superiority, the activity of the Hitlerite aviation had diminished, and fighters were called on more and more for delivery of strikes against concentrates of enemy personnel and equipment. The tactical techniques of the fighters largely were identical to those of the Il-2 attack aircraft. The pilots strove to attack the enemy unexpectedly from out of the sun or from low altitude, in order that the fascists not have time to scatter to the sides of the roads and open fire, and they distributed targets in the strike objective beforehand. Most convenient were attacks from a chandelle [boyevoy razvorot] (the wing and fuselage of the aircraft did not cover the target). Repeated attacks were made with additional maneuvers, which were determined depending on the nature of resistance of the target (return fire, dispersion, or camouflage). Naturally time has left its mark on accomplishment of this combat mission by fighter aviation. First of all, the speed and maneuver characteristics have changed, the armament is more powerful, and the range and accuracy of engagement of targets has increased. Second, the area air defense has been strengthened, but to use certain weapons' systems, after missile launch, fighters require some time to continue flight toward the target, and this increases their vulnerability to SAM fire. Third, the ground targets themselves have changed. There are now very many of them, ones which were unknown in the Great Patriotic War. Missile launchers, radar, SAM, multiple rocket launcher positions, helicopters on landing pads -- all these are small, camouflaged targets which can change their position quickly, and it is not so easy to identify and engage them. But these targets are weakly armored, and can be destroyed by fighter weapons. These three circumstances cannot but influence the development of fighter tactics. However, as in the past, the fighters operate against ground targets when it does not harm accomplishment of their basic combat missions. Otherwise, this would contradict the basic purpose of fighter aviation. Whereas during the conduct of aerial reconnaissance, pilots have to combine this with delivery of strikes against moving columns of enemy troops and combat equipment, when supporting other aviation arms, air defense assets will be possible targets, if there are no enemy fighters in the air. Here the pilots' tasks are very limited: not to destroy, but to hold in place, restrict maneuver or simply unmask the adversary, suppress his air defense weapons for a short time in order to create favorable conditions for subsequent air or missile strikes. But in all situations the pilots must maintain constant readiness to fight air-to-air battles. However in considering only passing strikes on ground targets, do we not understand the question too narrowly? After all, modern fighters are also capable of independent actions against enemy airfields. They can participate in air support of troops, supplementing the strikes of fighter-bombers and combat helicopters. After this short recollection of present-day conditions of action of fighters against ground targets, let us look at the commander who makes the decision for precisely such an independent strike. Here there is food for thought. Clearly the commander, upon clarifying the received mission, will consider the required deadlines for its accomplishment, assess the target characteristics, their range, and the completeness of the information about them. He will also allow for the expected resistance of enemy air defenses, the capabilities of his aircraft, the level of proficiency of the flight personnel, and of course the terrain relief, the presence of characteristic reference points, and weather. In the search for an optimal decision to strike, the commander is confronted by the following crucial questions: how to rationally distribute the fighter forces among the assigned or chosen targets and available time, what battle formation to take, how to attack the targets? Let us try to answer these questions with the commander. However, we must stipulate that without knowing the conclusions that the commander made in clarifying the mission and evaluating the specific situation, the answers might not be unequivocal. How should fighter forces be distributed to accomplish the mission? We shall propose three different variants to the commander. He can for example mass the efforts by delivering a simultaneous strike against a preset target at a specific time. If the situation demands long-term action against the same target, or not so many fighter forces, the commander clearly will find it more expedient to operate with individual flights and pairs. In a complex and unclear situation, he will most likely decide to perform the mission by operating with limited fighter forces. It goes without saying that there may also be other variants. In accordance with them, the commander distributes fighters among tactical groups, i.e., shifts to solution of the second crucial question -- determination of the battle formation. The commander must consider the different variants for its structure. If the strike objective is protected by a strong air defense, and there are enemy fighters patrolling in the air, if it is difficult to seek out and identify the target in the terrain, it will be necessary to create the tactical troops shown in figure 21. But analyze this distribution of forces: the combat strength of the supporting groups is 1.5 times greater than that of the strike force! Is such a ratio advisable? Here is why the commanders strive to combine the functions of the groups to the extent possible. For example, the group for suppression of the air defense weapons may be given the functions of followup reconnaissance of the target, and the group providing cover against enemy fighter attacks may change places with the strike force after it delivers its strike, as was the case in the cited example. Figure 21. Battle formation of fighters operating against a ground target. Group tactical And the third crucial question: how to attack the target? Attack on the move from extremely low altitude--1; or first execute a vertical maneuver--2 (fig. 22)? In using the first tactical technique, the pilots may simply not have time to detect the target and aim at high speed, and the attack will be unsuccessful. The second tactical technique reduces the surprise of the attack -- the time spent by the pilots in executing the maneuver is adequate for the enemy to fire on them with SAMs. How can this contradiction be resolved? Figure 22. Fighter attack of ground target. Just as in the answers to previous questions, one should not expect ready-made recommendations. Rote prescriptions will not work for all tactical situations. One must be able to make independent and able decisions. Here is one possible variant: if a flight delivers a strike on a ground target, and the first pair cannot attack on the move after the target is detected, it radios the target indication to the second pair, and itself executes a vertical maneuver and subsequent attack from a dive, as shown in Figure 22. The second pair makes the necessary turn to target and attacks it on the move, simultaneously suppressing the air defense weapons. A different situation may also develop: the first pair after detection of the target is capable of attacking it from the move. Then the second pair can either execute a vertical maneuver in order to better see the target, or also attack from the move. Everything is determined by the specific features of the target disposition, the enemy air defense weapons, and the level of your proficiency. What follows from our discussions? Actions against ground targets is a combat mission of fighter aviation demanding different modes of combat action, battle formations, tactical techniques, and consequently also thorough training of the fighter pilots for its accomplishment, in combination of training in air-to-air combat, which occupies the main place in the activity of fighter pilots. Thus for example the leaders of the U.S. Air Force plan additional theoretical and flight training for fighters to deliver strikes against ground targets. Each pilot of an F-15 fighter makes 18 flights every six months to practice the skills of fire on ground targets and, after the fire, provision is made for the conduct of air-to-air battles. (AVIATION WEEK, 1984, No. 12). * * * Much has changed in the tactics of fighter aviation since the end of the Great Patriotic War, but all of its basic combat missions have remained unchanged, have become classical, and received further development. New ones have also appeared, for example, destruction of airborne assaults, disruption of aerial transports of the enemy, the battle with targets which previously did not exist (early warning and detection aircraft, reconnaissance-strike complexes, etc.) The tactics of fighter aviation in accomplishment of these tasks have their own specific features. The development of fighter aviation tactics in accomplishment of combat missions occurs simultaneously with the improvement of aviation equipment. This shall be discussed further. Chapter II. The Labyrinthine Links of Tactics and Technology The development of tactics and technology occurs in a dialectical unit and interrelationship. A qualitative leap in technology calls to life new tactical techniques, and the development of technology in turn engenders new types of weapons. An experienced reader on reading these lines will shrug: who is not familiar with this well-known theoretical precept? This is so, but let us level deeper into the labyrinthine links, and we will find many facts there which, alas, contradict this precept. 1. "Tactics Must Because Technology Can't"; "Technology Can So Tactics Don't Have To" Missiles or Cannon? In the vivid blue sky, an air-to-air battle is under way, one can see the flash of silver wings, hear the booming thump of the airborne cannons. First-generation jets, possessing only cannon for now, are fighting. But the spatial dimensions of the battle region of the new aircraft are no long the same (after all, their speed is 350-400 km/hr faster than that of piston planes), and the old weapons do not allow them to deliver fire from long range. Therefore the air warriors, as during the Great Patriotic War, still strive to close with one another to a range of 200-300 meters. As a result of intensive maneuvering in the air, the same familiar "carousel" arose, but no irresistible attacks resulted. Tactics dictated its demands to technology, and this led to the advent of air-to-air guided missiles. Of course the first missiles were not sufficiently reliable in battle, but they had a very valuable quality, the capacity to hit the adversary at long range. So how did events develop further? Guided missiles became the basic type of fighter weapon. The arena of the air-to-air battle immediately expanded. The adversary had only to enter any point in the possible missile launch region at target engagement range unattainable by cannon, and he was close to victory, even with the launch of a single missile. And then the years-long monopoly of the cannon, which knew no rivals, was destroyed, and with it collapsed all the tactics of fighters based on cannon fire. Missiles fully supplanted the cannon, which had been removed from the armament by the end of the 50s. Fighters became "pure" missile platforms. However, soon there was cause to regret this bitterly. It turned out that missiles developed to engage targets from long range, and possessing restrictions in minimal range and launch aspect, G forces and altitude of utilization, could not replace cannon in close combat. With the start of maneuver, missiles would pass by. For example, in the first year of the Vietnam War, of every 11 Sidewinder missiles fired by American fighters, only one hit the target. (INTERAVIA. 1974, No. 12). After unsuccessful missile launch, pilots closed with the targets, but had nothing to engage them with, and the number of missiles on board did not exceed two to four. And there were failures, still not understood, which, despite the desperate attempts of the pilots to execute the missile launch, led to break-off of the attack. The unreliability of the weapons took away their confidence in battle, a necessary condition for victory. Later on, the influence of electronic jamming on the missiles added to these shortcomings. Thus it was found that missiles are far from being the ideal weapon, especially to engage a maneuvering adversary at close range. After expenditure of a limited number of missiles, the fighter became virtually unarmed. But even cannon did not have high effectiveness. No dialectical unit in the development of technology and tactics was achieved. A paradox arose in the labyrinthine interrelationship, which could be formulated as: "Tactics have to -- technology can't." What was to be done? It was necessary to again mount those same cannon on fighters. Despite their inherent short range and narrow sector of fire, they again demonstrated greater simplicity of design and reliability than missiles, had no limitations of minimal firing range, and in addition were slow to become outmoded. To this day modern fighters have cannon, and evidently they will stay on prospective aircraft. However, the second birth of cannon did not lead to a reduction in the role of missiles. Today fighters can launch them from long and short range, at any aspects. The missiles have significantly larger launch zones, high maneuver and energy-ballistic characteristics, and this allows the pilots to destroy air targets flying several kilometers higher than the fighters. There are short-range missiles to engage visible targets, allowing surprise attack from the most diverse positions. The jamming resistance of the missiles is growing constantly. But then what is the point of the cannon? It is this: like any other weapons system, missiles have their own restrictions and their joint use with cannon allows the fighters to attack the adversary under conditions when missiles are not effective enough. One can even avoid all-aspect missiles if the appropriate maneuver is made ahead of time, and not only avoid, but in the process enter the field of fire of one's own cannon. Cannon also remain invulnerable to electronic jamming. Improvement of missiles forces the designers to search for ways also to improve the cannon of fighters. How many models of aircraft cannon have been devised by engineering thought! Multi-barrel and single-barrel ones of the revolver type, 20-millimeter and higher caliber cannon. Tactics demand increased fire density, and the rate of fire of the guns grows, require that the range of fire be increased, and the initial velocity of the rounds is increased, require that the accuracy be improved, and rounds are designed which are guided in their trajectory, with proximity fuzes, new sighting and computing devices are devised, a system for display on the front of the cockpit canopy, systems using holographic lenses and liquid crystals -- all this in order to meet the demands of tactics. As we see, ultimately the paradox of "tactics have to, technology can't" has exhausted itself. However in the labyrinthine interrelations one can also observe the opposite paradoxes, "technology can, tactics don't have to." These Insidious Properties of Speed The beginning of the jet era was marked by a great leap in speed of aircraft, which immediately increased by 350-400 km/hr in comparison with the speed of piston aircraft. Limited capabilities of pilots to search for and destroy targets at such speeds were compensated for by weapons radars and guided missiles. The framework of battle covered the range of supersonic speeds and penetrated the stratosphere. Command posts with ground radars were included in command and control. An unprecedented takeoff of design thinking, brilliant solution of seemingly impossible problems in the tactics of fighter aviation! Using the great flight speed, fighters could more quickly assume a favorable position for battle and announce their appearance with a crushing missile strike from long range before the adversary could make a defensive maneuver or even see the attackers. By the end of the 50s, in the views of many military theorists the logic of the air-to-air battle appeared as follows: guidance of the fighter from the ground, closing with the target in a straight trajectory, single lightning attack and launch of missiles in flight at high speed in a straight line. In order to vanquish the adversary, it was necessary to see him first and have time to launch the missiles. Therefore the success of battle was determined basically by the competition of the sides in the range of detection of ground and airborne radars. The close maneuver battle in the classical scheme of intercept was not envisaged; what is more it was recommended to the pilots that they avoid guns, since they lead to rapid loss of speed. To please the then-common concepts and demands of tactics on technology, aviation designers of the leading countries of the world were absorbed by the problem of achieving great speeds in their development of prospective fighters. While fighters by the start of the 50s had a speed corresponding to M = 0.8-0.9, in the 60s it had already reached M = 2.2 and more. The triumphant growth of speed was not halted either by technical difficulties or by significant economic expenditures, but one other problem was noted here, which had the most serious consequences: such great speeds could not be used by the fighters in air-to-air battles. Here was cause for surprise: why had all fighters during the Second World War resorted to maximum speed quite often, and their descendants could not realize these speeds? The answer to this question demanded serious examination of objective processes of technologic development. If military theorists could somehow predict the vicissitudes of air-to-air battle at subsonic speeds, the absurdity of the arising situation put them at an impasse. Yet another paradox? The fact was that high supersonic speeds narrowed the field of possible attacks and ruled out maneuvering at short distances. Indeed, the flight itself of the fighter to interception, which was almost programmed, presupposed straight-line movement of the air target, and was not marked by great diversity of variants. Arrival at the point of detection of the target was based on standard, already practiced maneuvers. But it is much easier to deceive a pre-entered program after it has been used several times. Reality confirmed this. Air-to-air battles of fighters in local wars usually included not one but several attacks and maneuvers between attacks. In these battles, speed in itself meant little. It had importance only jointly with the established G force, i.e., the capacity to maneuver. The pilots sought as quickly as possible to turn and reach the area of possible attacks, but the radiuses and time of the turns of the fighters had increased so much that they went beyond the limits of visual contact with the adversary and could not continue the battle. Therefore, they had to deliberately operate only in a range of subsonic speeds. And now we again must ask ourselves: where here is the dialectical unity in the development of tactics and technology? Something unacceptable had occurred -- "technology can, tactics don't have to." Speed or maneuverability? Which characteristics should be preferred, if they are difficult to separate from one another, if they are directly related and mutually caused? In the search for acceptable answers to these questions, military specialists largely reached the conclusion that to conduct air-to- air-battles fighters were needed with flight characteristics ensuring high angular velocities and accelerations, minimal turning radiuses, and good controllability in a broad range of altitudes. But the maximum speed, in their opinion, must correspond to M = 2-2.5. (FLUG REVUE, 1970, VII.) The way out of this paradox was not long in coming. The tendency of continuous growth in speed continued until the end of the 60s. In the last twenty years, however, the speed of fighters has not vitally increased, but has not diminished either. This tendency toward restriction of speed is surprisingly stable. It turns out that the well-known motto of aviation, "fly higher, further, and faster" requires clarification for fighters. It is not always necessary to fly fastest. Of course, we cannot discard the former motto, but a supplement to it suggests itself: fly fastest only before the start of battle. The precept has not changed even today. Pilots of the F-15 fighter argue that upon detection of targets even at long range (75 km) and in flight at maximum speed they do not have time to lock on, track, and air, resulting in breakoff of the attacks. Single-Purpose or Multi-Purpose Fighter? The high performance requirements on aircraft and their armament, formulated in resolution of the first two paradoxes, led to a third, confronting military scientists and designers with a dilemma: single-purpose or multi-purpose fighter? Initially a characteristic feature in aircraft construction was the development of single-purpose fighters, specially adapted for the conduct of air-to-air combat (in the foreign press they were called air superiority fighters). The basic demands on them: great thrust-to-weight ratio [tyagovooruzhennost], exceeding flight weight; low specific load on the wing; high strength of construction, intended for high G forces; good acceleration characteristics and climb; sight and weapons for long-range and close combat, making it possible to detect and attack targets flying higher, lower, and to the side against a background of clutter. (AVIATION AND MARINE. 1976, No. 29). Colossal sums were spent to develop single-purpose aircraft, many years were required, and such fighters (F-15 and F-16) were constructed in the U.S. in the early 70s. Subsequently they assigned them two equivalent tasks, so that they be used for actions against ground targets, and called them multi-purpose aircraft. However it was soon found that in contrast to former generations such expensive aircraft were little suited for this. The paradoxical nature of the prevailing situation lay in the fact that the narrowly specialized fighters were deprived of the capability, as had been the case in past wars, of quickly shifting from one mission to the other, building up efforts of strike aviation in support of troops, or flexible use in critical situations of the combined-arms battle. Nor were economic assessments the least consideration. (The single-purpose F-15C fighter costs 30 million dollars, and the multi-purpose F-15E 2.5 million dollars more (INTERAVIA AIR LETTER, 1986, 22 December). For this reason, in the countries of Western Europe, which did not have adequate funds for construction of specialized fighters, only multi-purpose fighters were developed, intended for the accomplishment of both tasks. In this regard, a struggle of two contradictory tendencies began in airplane construction. One of them continued to be directed toward development of fighters for air-to-air combat, and the other toward development of multi-purpose fighters having the qualities of the fighter, the bomber, and the ground-attack plane. The opinions of specialists were divided. Some showed lively interest in multi-purpose aircraft, others spoke ironically about the unrestrained fantasy of the latter. Say the "pure fighter" proponents, Sure you can also fight with multi-purpose planes, but combining in one plane such contradictory characteristics as increased maneuverability and the capacity to carry a good payload, to accommodate complex and bulky equipment, inevitably leads to an increase in flight weight of the aircraft. For example, that same single-purpose F-15 fighter, after refitting to a multi-purpose aircraft, weighed 34 tonnes instead of 20, and the F-16 fighter 22 tonnes instead of 16. (INTERNATIONAL DEFENSE REVIEW, 1983, No. 2.) Can this promote energetic maneuvers in air-to-air combat? And strikes against ground targets? After all, in the Vietnam War pilots of the multi-purpose F-4 Phantom, without adequate professional training, suffered much greater losses than fighter bombers. (AIR FORCE MAGAZINE, 1972, No. 8.) Proponents of multi-purpose planes are charmed by the universality of their use (the plane remains the same, but is augmented with onboard equipment, arms, and programs entered in the moment of the onboard computer), and also the standardization of the technical maintenance and repair. And if universal machines are not possible, then at least air-to-air fighters must constitute a good basis for modification of them into multi-purpose aircraft. Different opinions, different approaches. Time will tell which of the tendencies will be more developed, but for now we are interested in the causes of the paradoxes, arising in the labyrinthine relations of tactics and technology. The Burial Ground of Projects It would of course be foolish to assume the relations of tactics and technology consist only of paradoxes and contradictions, but nonetheless... Technology provides fighters with missiles, and the fighters demand their former cannon; technology offers greater speed, and fighters abandon the concept of a one-time missile attack, and halt before the choice of single-purpose or multi-purpose aircraft. In this labyrinth there is always something unpredictable, you never really know what will happen tomorrow. From this aspect it seems to almost be a riddle. And at the same time, vivid unusual findings which are fated to move tactics forward! The history of aviation also knows many other examples, when the implementation of tempting, at first glance, projects ended in failure. What projects have specialists not developed, what predictions have they not made! It cannot be the case that they did not know what they were about. On the basis of statistical data by means of modelling, extrapolation, expert evaluation, the state of the aircraft inventory was predicted decades in advance, new types of air weapons were determined. Did it all go right? By the logic of the designers, they were supposed to achieve colossal successes. However let us return to projects of 10-15 years ago and what do we see? The time for adoption of new models had come or was drawing near, but certain of them were never developed. Here are a few examples of unfulfilled projects. At the start of the 70s development was halted on seemingly promising types of weapons for strategic bombers: Skybolt ballistic missiles, defensive BDM missiles, and also "Scud" decoys which were widely proclaimed in the press. Somewhat later the same fate befell remote-controlled aircraft for various purposes, and certain models of reconnaissance strike complexes (SOTAS). All these models remained just projects, although they had been thought up, calculated, drawn on paper, and many even incorporated in metal. However, although the engineers participating in realization of these projects showed great stubbornness, opposing the failures with their technical inventiveness, they never reached serial production. The new models died without being born. This at-first-glance illogical phrase in fact very precisely reflects the logic of development of one of the interacting sides. Can one be surprised? When tactics are silent, technology creates new paradoxes. But not only the designers erred. It would be wrong to assume that such paradoxes were not made by military theorists in the field of tactics. One need only recall their serious miscalculations in determining the role of fighter aviation with the advent of SAMs and nuclear weapons, or the denial of maneuver multiple-aircraft battles already mentioned above. A 25-year-old prediction is recalled with irony. "There can be no question of air-to-air battles in the far future," the NATO journal REVUE MILITAIRE GENERALE announced categorically. "Essentially the concept of air-to-air combat, which was a necessary component of the early period of war, has already become outmoded. We must repeat that the tactics of air-to-air combat should be consigned to the archives." (REVUE MILITAIRE GENERALE, 1964, February). Some concepts put forward in the West shifted battle to the stratosphere, it never reached there, but remained in the range of high and low altitudes. This sad catalogue of paradoxes and other most silly proposals in the field of tactics is annoying and boring. It is easy to judge events and persons from such a long distance, when we look at the tactics and technology of long-ago years, but at the same time it is not easy, if we do not note the causal relationships of the phenomena. Alas they are not immediately evident. To us, the errors in assessments, the limitation of tactical thinking and engineering thought in understanding the relations of tactics and technology are evident, at times incomprehensible, and even laughable. But while possessing some historical experience, strangely we at times repeat these same errors and must speak ironically of ourselves. Conflict situations, as a result of which joint or uncoordinated efforts of tactics and technology do not achieve the desired goals, and enormous resources are squandered, gave cause for humorists to call the field of relations of tactics and technology the "burial ground of projects and concepts." Unfortunately, this sarcastic quip is not far from the truth and sometimes appears as if a cruel fate pursues tacticians and engineers, but it is not a matter of mysticism. Only one need not take the easy path, that of endless rebukes of engineers and tacticians: they didn't allow for this and didn't uncover that. However there is a point to asking questions: whence these unpredictable turns in the development of tactics and technology, how can one find reasonable explanations to such puzzling metamorphoses in technical projects and tactical concepts? And finally, what is the way out of this impasse? Let us try to look closely at this bundle of contradictions, and then we might find some quite unexpected answers. 2. The Search For a Way Out An Equation With Many Unknowns In pondering the relations of technology and tactics, and the unsuccessful projects, one willy nilly begins thinking about the mistakes that were made. There are many grounds for believing that they testify not to laziness of intellect, incompetence of tacticians and engineers, or their ignorance of research being done, and developments in the given fields, but rather inadequate allowance for form conditions. In some cases they did not pay heed to practical requirements of a tactical or engineering idea, the justification for large economic expenditures, some unfavorable factors, and, in others, they raised the importance of secondary factors, or those which did not receive further development. These circumstances are very reminiscent of an equation with many unknowns. One can say with confidence only that not one of its members (factors) should be equal to zero. How to resolve this equation, or in other words, how serious are such circumstances? The fact is that with acceleration of scientific-technical progress and the development of new technologies, when the opportunity has arisen to create planes and weapons at accelerated rates, less time remains for the influence of technology on tactics. In addition, more vital and vivid changes in combat properties of new models of technology hinder consideration and allowance for all influencing factors. The advent of guided missiles and radar weapons sights influenced tactics incomparably more than the replacement of aircraft machineguns with cannon. The equation with many unknowns remains even today. Therefore one cannot rule out the possibility of unexpected scientific-technical breakthroughs and surprise leaps in development of technology, even in related fields, which might be used in the interests of tactics. What is more, such an unprogrammed innovation, coming into the world, often reveals tactical properties which not even its creators foresaw. Of course it at once consigns to second place the models which existed previously. Such situations are a great rarity, and they cannot immediately lead to radical changes in tactics. For example, was it possible to program with adequate precision the expected changes in tactics on the eve of creation of guided missiles and weapons radars? Is it possible today to anticipate such changes in the event, say, of the appearance of laser or some other weapons of fighters with fundamentally new, still unknown properties, which will immediately lead to the outmoding of present missiles and sights? Would the tactics of battle of jet aircraft not undergo immediate vital changes. Thus the jokers again will have cause to make fun of the utterance "technology can, tactics don't have to." Here there is yet another quite weighty circumstance: the number of technical alternatives for satisfaction of the identical demands of tactics is growing swiftly. Look, reader, at a far from complete list of these alternatives (Table 1). How can we balance and ensure a rational combination of them, without resorting to the experience of the tailor mending Grisha's caftan. I will not bother you with superfluous explanations, and offer them for your own comparison and analysis. Table 1 Technical Requirements Technical alternatives for satisfying tactical demands Shortened takeoff and landing roll High afterburner power-to-weight ratio, mechanization of wing, low specific load on wing, enhanced-power JATO units, reverse and deflection of the thrust vector Supersonic cruising speed in High non-afterburning non-afterburning engine operating thrust-to-weight ratio, low drag, modes presence of air intakes with variable geometry, engines operating as bypass turbojet engines [TRDD] at subsonic speeds and as turbojet engines at supersonic speeds Higher maneuverability at subsonic High thrust-to-weight ratio and and supersonic speeds aerodynamic quality at high G forces, wing mechanization, control of thrust vector and aerodynamic forces Long range and flight time Economical engines, including variable cycle, abandonment of afterburning operating modes of engines, high aerodynamic quality, adaptive wings, presence of automatic flight and engine control systems Covertness of actions Reduction in radar, IR, and optical signation of aircraft (low-reflection shapes, radio-absorbent coatings, presence of built-in systems for suspension of missiles, screening of heated engine parts), presence of low-radiation and non-radiating equipment (IR, electronic apparatus operating in passive mode), laser communications systems Survivability Armoring of vital elements and reduction in vulnerable areas in the designs of aircraft, redundancy and backup of onboard systems, materials ensuring protection of the pilot and optoelectronic apparatus from radiation High combat readiness Various engineer and design solutions, making it possible to speed up engine start (steam-turbine starters with a start time of less than 20 seconds), enhanced-power JATO units, start of battle (all-aspect missiles) Minimal volume and time and high Presence of modular design engines, reliability of technical maintenance easily removed assemblies for suspension of various arms and their standardization, presence of automated systems of monitoring and testing apparatus and diagnostics of equipment status, multi-purpose equipment for simultaneous supplying of the aircraft with oils, special fluids, charging with compressed gases, mechanization of the processes of fueling and charging the aircraft You of course will allow for the contradictory nature of tactical requirements (high speed and maneuverability, maneuverability and low wing load, etc.), will assess the tendency of growth of the most characteristic indices, e.g., energy-to-weight ratio (0.4 in the first postwar fighters, 0.7 to 0.8 in fighters of the 50s, 1.2 in modern ones). Do not forget to compare also the comparative importance of tactical requirements. For example the range and duration of flight. Behind these demands is the capability of intercepting the adversary at remote lines, long air patrol time, basing at airfields far from the front line, broad maneuver along the front and in depth. It goes without saying that the variety of technical alternatives does not decide the fate of present or planed developments, but it is directly related to them. This may lead to unforeseen leaps in the development of technology, and may, on the contrary, separate the efforts of designers and engineers with incomplete allowance for all influencing factors. After all, not every alternative variant can be immediately implemented, but that which today is not feasible, i.e., does not have the necessary conditions for realization, will tomorrow become a real possibility. And now, let us examine these questions from the standpoint of tactics. Its needs at times exceed the capabilities of technology. Although the changes themselves in it are a response to some urgent problems of tactics, the lag of technology behind the demands of tactics, as testified to by numerous examples, is a quite frequent phenomenon in the history of fighter aviation. One cannot discount also the subjective factors: the dictate of engineering thought contrary to tactical considerations, and the development of tactical demands without allowance for their technical realization. If this occurs, the lack of understanding between tacticians and engineers most often acquires a conflict nature. This is the logical chain which is established on the path of emergency from the labyrinth of relations and in the search for right solutions. With the sharp acceleration in the number of models of new weapons produced per unit of time, just as the speedup of advances in tactics, these relations become increasingly more complex and elusive. They are not always stable and have numerous manifestations. Precisely in the exceptional breadth and multifaceted nature of the relations of tactics and technology, in their incomplete comprehension, in the "volitional" voluntaristic solutions, when the development of new tactical techniques and modes of weapons is conducted without allowance for mutual capacities, finally in the absence of a uniform criterion, one finds the causes of many paradoxes. This is the essence of the equation with many unknowns. Where then is the way out? Only in a profound understanding of the dialectics of development of tactics and technology, in an even more profound allowance for their relations. The Fields of Cooperation of Tactics and Technology The reader has noted of course that he is again being nudged toward a truism: under the influence of tactics, the technical aspect of fighters is formed, their characteristics are optimized, while the improvement of technology leads to changes in the nature of battle. In tracing these relations, we have seen that despite the contradictions, in response to every critical situation (paradox), even if not at once, the pilots had at their disposal both technical innovations and new tactical techniques. Only this dialectic does not always yield to the logic of scientific thinking. The aspiration of military scientists and designers to penetrate the labyrinths of relations of tactics and technology, as before, collides with a whole group of contradictory and complex factors. Therefore, in order that the "wonders of technology" planned for development not turn out to be ultimately merely clever fabrications of designers, one can say that the basis of design of new technology and development of tactics should be long-term forecasting and a systems approach. What is a systems approach, what an integrated approach? The total system of relations may be represented as the totality of a number of functioning elements, as a strictly coordinated group, including subsystems of the aircraft, weapons of one's own and those of the enemy, the tactics of the opposing sides, the means of supporting their combat actions, and more fragmented components. But we will not hold to strict scientific formulations. If you, the reader, in delving into some technical engineering problem, simultaneously weigh both of its aspects, allow for the countering action of the probable adversary, assess and coordinate the different combinations of characteristics of speed, maneuverability, level of signature and survivability with the weapons and support equipment, estimate the technical risk of development, carefully formulate its goals, beforehand "play out" the variants of their attainment, in short comprehensively trace all relations in accordance with a uniform program, and on the basis of uniform initial ideas, consider that you are using a systems approach. This is not easy to do. But if the reader keeps the desire to have his say in tactics, and receive responses regarding the way of their further development, he must search for them in each element of the system and on the basis of interests of the system as a whole. To do this he needs to study all the fields and directions, in which military-technical and operational-tactical thought is operating today, and assess which of them promises the greatest success. Only then can one continue the noted tendencies tomorrow, and most importantly, allow for the alternative combinations in selection of the optimal variant from those shown in Table 1. However, we must stipulate that this is practically feasible only for large collectives of tacticians and engineers, crossing traditional borders between the concepts of "tactics" and "technology." They are the ones who form the "tactical order" for technology, precise, clear, understandable, which might be accomplished. The "tactical order," or demands on technology, forms literally all elements of tactics. Only after soberly and judiciously weighing our "subsystems," can one find and justify the inherent requirements. Otherwise one cannot emerge from the numerous impasses. If we again analyze Table 1, it is not hard to imagine many fields of successful cooperation of tactics and technology satisfying its needs. Now there are becoming more and more of them. Without retelling and without assessing the ways of satisfying all demands of tactics shown in the table with technology, let us first turn to one, seemingly not the main one, of minimal volume, time, and high reliability of technical maintenance. But this requirement lays bare many other problems as well, which one must ponder. Who needs plans with a high volume of technical maintenance, frequent failures and breakdowns, with high repair time? What would be the level of combat readiness of subunits and a unit if the preparation of aircraft for a sortie takes not minutes, but hours? Note that the increasing complexity of aviation equipment, the difficulty in finding defects, errors in the computer software which is part of present-day equipment, and also the shortage of highly qualified specialists -- all this aggravates the problem. How should aircraft designers proceed in order to raise the reliability of operation of aviation equipment, reduce the duration of preparation for sorties, and repair of damaged aircraft? Let's look at fourth-generation aircraft. They already include many improvements of those shown in Table 1. The MiG-29 (Figure 23) [not reproduced], for example. Replacement of the engines in them takes just a few dozen minutes without removal of the fuselage, while before it took many hours. And the Su-27 aircraft (Figure 24) [not reproduced], equipped with modular-design engines, consisting of individual units. If damage occurs, there is no need to replace the whole engine. It suffices to replace the faulty module. The reliability of operation of the equipment in flight has also grown. On those same Su-27s, the onboard systems operate with quadruple redundancy, and there is also a maximum mode limiter. Reliability of operation of the equipment, the deadlines and cost of repair and overhaul of faulty aircraft to a significant degree are determined by the capabilities of the monitoring and testing systems. Using such systems, which record the readouts of numerous sensors located in the required places, one can automatically monitor the status of the onboard equipment (functional monitoring) and also automatically identify arising defects (functional diagnostics). For this the corresponding programs are entered in the computers of the systems. Imagine, after landing you taxi to the parking area. The technician connects the mobile monitoring and testing station to the aircraft, and switches on the equipment. And checking the "health" of the plane, a tape is fed from the printer with signs, numbers, and pulses incomprehensible to the layman. Casting a penetrating glance at it, the technician (granted, under your supervision) reads the "diagnosis" and takes the necessary steps in accordance with it. Provided there is high reliability of diagnostics, and consequently of the technical maintenance itself, it will become possible to reduce or do away with individual operations, conduct complete preflight preparation right after conclusion of the regular flight. All this crowds more into the time of operation of the aviation equipment, and thus increases the number of combat ready aircraft per hour, per day. But isn't this tantamount to increasing the fighter aviation forces with the same organic strength of fighters in the subunit and unit? And a reduction in the numerical strength of the engineer-technical personnel maintaining the aviation equipment, the strength of the repair organs, reduces the needs for tools, simplifying documentation? Such machines, so expensive to produce, are becoming more and more economical in operation, and make it possible to save many of the people's rubles. But this is still not all. Leaving the technicians on the ground with their infallible prognoses, you climb into the air to perform the combat mission. In the air-to-air battle you of course do not have time to systematically monitor the operation of the engine and equipment. Here you are assisted by the onboard monitoring and testing systems, which are based on self-diagnosis of their operation. They sensitively pick up how the engine is operating, how the temperature is holding, how fuel is being expended. If a sensor signals danger, be it failure, malfunction of some aggregate or other problem, the onboard computer, after sorting through many variants, picks the optimal one: redundant or reserve channels are switched on, ensuring accomplishment of the functions of the failed aggregate. Here the pilot is told what has been done on what and why. It seems improbable that the system itself makes the decision. This is how a seemingly secondary requirement of tactics is realized. (The time for technical maintenance of American F-15 fighters is one third less than for the F-4, and was reduced even more for the F-16. The leaders of the U.S. Air Force bluntly state their readiness to give up certain performance characteristics of the fighters if this makes it possible to reduce the volume and time and raise the reliability of maintenance and repair capacity.) (AIR FORCE, 1985, No. 4) In designing new planes, aircraft designers do not forget other tactical demands either. In accordance with them, the performance of fighters has been improved, the power of the weapons grows, and reliability of technical maintenance (Fig. 25) is enhanced. Figure 25. Technology meets the demands of tactics. Multifaceted and complex fields of cooperation of tactics and equipment have many different aspects. The adversary's electronic countermeasures are growing, prompting designers to develop interference resistant weapons sights, and receivers to warn of radar and IR radiation, automatic devices for ejecting dipole reflectors and decoy targets. This diverse assortment of EW means are quickly supplemented by built-in active jammers, apparatus to counter electro-optical and laser weapons of the adversary. It is necessary to simplify the use of these numerous equipments by the pilot of a single-seater fighter aircraft. In response to this requirement of tactics, whole systems are being developed which are based on integration of separately operating onboard systems and automation of EW process. Here the designers provide for onboard energy resources to support operation of such systems, an expedient sequence of suppression of radars and types of jamming, and the commanders are given the right to clarify the control personnel of the EW assets before a sortie in accordance with the data of electronic reconnaissance and the assigned combat mission. The need arises to control the battle from onboard the fighters, and in the cockpits of the group commanders tactical situation scopes have appeared (Figure 26) [not reproduced]. On the multicolor display, without turning his head the commander can see the location and heading of the aircraft, friendly and enemy, determine their speed and altitude from a marker, know which of the pilots of his group are engaging, and monitor their actions. All the areas of successful cooperation of tactics and technology cannot be enumerated. The pilot-radar probably can recall many such examples. But we are interested in examining only those which are incorporated in the construction of new-generation fighters, those which are to be assimilated on the threshold of the 21st century. After all, the dialectics of interaction of technology and equipment are such that in the process of satisfying the demands of today, the demands of tomorrow will be born. 3. Fighters on the Threshold of the Twenty-First Century The change of fighter aircraft, piston, jet, supersonic, occurring in the second half of our century, is approaching its next turn. What will the generation of fighters be like which is about to replace the current generation? How are their appearance, armament, and equipment envisioned? These questions, on the eve of the year 2000, concern both the air veteran and the new pilot. Take a look at the sketches of such fighters (Figure 27) [not reproduced]. For the present they arouse only our delight, do they not? Sharp-nosed, sharp-winged, and swift! Let us take a closer look at this unknown that attracts us. According to the performance requirements, developed by military specialists abroad, the new-generation fighters must be fast and maneuverable, have a low level of give-away signs, and equipment to destroy a large number of targets simultaneously. (AIR FORCE, 1988. No. 1) Let us begin with speed. In contrast to present-day fighters, the new ones should have supersonic cruising speed in non-afterburning operating modes. This quality is necessary for more economical fuel expenditure, making it possible to expand the region of effective coverage of installations against air strikes and sharply raising the capabilities of the fighters in terms of rapid intercept of aerial targets at remote lines (Figure 28). (INTERAVIA, 1985. No. 6). From the figure it is clear that the possible lines of intercept for fighters with supersonic cruising speed may be extended by a factor of two or more, all other conditions being equal, in comparison with the American F-15 fighters without it (the fighters will head for the interception from alert status at an airfield five and two minutes after detection of the target, which is moving at a speed corresponding to M = 1.5 at a height of 1,500 meters). (INTERNATIONAL DEFENSE REVIEW, 1987. No. 5.) In addition, during flight at such speed, the duration of pursuit of targets is significantly reduced, and the threat of engagement of fighters by ground AD weapons of the adversary is diminished. Figure 28. Possible lines of interception of aerial targets. At the same time, design thinking continues to search for new engineering solutions to expand the maneuver characteristics and the field of combat application of fighters in a great range of altitudes and speeds, including at low sub-sonic speeds. Success can be achieved here, in addition to all else, through control of the thrust vector of the engine using swiveling nozzles (for vertical displacement of the aircraft, the nozzles are tilted downward, and in horizontal flight backward) and the use of systems to control aerodynamic forces (Figure 29, position 1). Figure 29. Possible expansion of the field of combat application of fighters. The last point requires explanation. The fact is that systems based on direct control of lift and lateral forces allow the pilots to change the attitude of the aircraft without changing the flight trajectory, or vice versa, changing the trajectory while retaining the position of one or several axes (flat turns without roll, vertical displacements without a change in the angle of pitch). Such fundamentally new maneuvers may be performed using an automated system or manually. This system also allows good controllability in flight modes close to critical. In addition, the field of new application of fighters with respect to altitude and speed may be expanded through further increase in the power of the engines and improvement in the aerodynamic qualities of the airframe (Figure 29, position 2). The altitude and speed characteristics of the American F-16 fighter are shown by way of comparison. A most important characteristic feature in the development of new- generation fighters will be the reduction in their tell-tale signs. This is not a new feature, to be sure. The attempt has always been made to make fighters hard to detect by the adversary. However in the past the campaign against tell-tale signs was conducted only in some directions (masking camouflage paint, radio silence) and never waged along the entire front. But these trends were only half-measures; the tell-tale signs remained. However no design solutions, even in the form of controversial hypotheses, laying the formation for further research, were considered for some time. As always in such cases, many dilettantish, unsound arguments, about noiseless aircraft, optically transparent, etc., arose. This was like the idea of conversion of a beam of light into electrical energy. Theoretically possible, but in practice... Only the level of scientific and technical progress and technology of the 70s made it possible to begin combatting tell-tale signs of fighters in different ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum, but the task proved to be more complex. There are many directions in which work is under way. Perhaps the most important today is the reduction in radar cross section of the fighters, in order to hamper their detection by radar assets, for it is radar which at present has the best characteristics in comparison with other means, and comprises the basis of the air defense system. In order to reduce the radar cross section, aerodynamic shapes and configurations of aircraft are being improved -- everything to avoid right angles and reduce the area of plane surfaces or replace them with a large number of flat edges, which reflect the radio waves away from the direction of the operating radar. In place of the traditional metallic materials, the aircraft designs more and more use radio-absorbing composite materials and coatings which scatter the electromagnetic energy of the radar signals. The second area of importance is suppression of thermal radiation of fighters, chiefly from the propulsion systems. Besides the radar range of electromagnetic waves, the IR range is the only one in which aircraft may be detected beyond visual limits. This is an even more difficult technical problem, because no fighter can do without a powerful, afterburning engine. In order to reduce the intensity of thermal radiation, heat-absorbing and insulating materials are used, the most heated parts of the engine are screened, their nozzles are cooled, and various materials are injected into the stream of exhaust gases to reduce the temperature of the gases or change the radiation spectrum. It is still unclear which of these directions will gain the highest priority in the future, but most likely they will develop in tandem, with a revision of the already traditional priorities depending on the development of means of detection of the opposing side. The development of new models of arms and onboard apparatus, which must not give away the fighters, also has its own directions. It will be necessary to abandon external suspension of many types of weapons, and mount them flush with the surface of the aircraft in specially made recesses in the skin, do away with suspended containers in favor of apparatus built into the fuselage, and reduce the number of projecting antennas. All specialists stress as one that if powerful radars remain on the aircraft, which are incapable of operating in the short-term radiation mode, and there are no other non-radiating means of detection of air targets (IR sights, electronic reconnaissance equipment, laser equipment), if outside fuel tanks and suspended missiles are retained, then all the striving of the pilots to achieve surprise in battle will be in vain, and they will be a lucrative target for missiles guided to the operating radars. More strict demands are also imposed on the dimensions of the radar antennas, which may increase the radar cross section of the aircraft. As a result of all these improvements, the designers hope to develop a fighter whose radar cross section does not exceed 0.1 meters squared. In addition, in the interests of a close air-to-air battle, it is still considered necessary for fighters of the new generation to have a comfortable cockpit, which does not restrict the view or pilot capabilities of constant visual contact with aircraft of the opposing side. Foreign military specialists, arguing the importance of this requirement, cite statistical data according to which 80 percent of all losses of fighters in combat actions since the Second World War have been related to inadequate pilot knowledge of the surrounding air situation.(FLIGHT, 1988. No. 4118.) In the field of armament, despite the existing differences in designs and their determining concepts, the tendency of equipment fighter aircraft with all-aspect long- and intermediate-range missiles, and also short-range missiles and cannon, has been rather precisely determined. Powerful weapons are being developed, allowing engagement of air targets at various ranges, from many tens of kilometers to tens of meters, and at any aspect. Autonomy of action after launch, i.e., guidance to target without constant tracking by the onboard radar, is considered a necessary property of future missiles. The fact is that the need to hold the target in radar lock-on during launch of missiles with radar semi-active guidance "ties" the pilot to a single enemy plane for a rather long time (by the yardstick of an air-to-air battle). According to data in the foreign press, this time can reach 20-25 or 10-20 seconds, depending on whether the target is inside or outside of visual range (for the Sparrow medium-range missile). In this time another enemy aircraft can suddenly attack the fighters. For example, the American AMRAAM missiles have this property -- they are equipped with active radar homing heads and a guidance system in the middle phase of the flight trajectory. Having autonomous missiles, pilots are able to begin any maneuver immediately after their launch. This property is called "fire and forget" abroad. (INTERNATIONAL DEFENSE REVIEW, 1987. No. 5.) The capabilities of launching missiles in a direction away from one's aircraft, and a changing the thrust vector of their engines, are qualitatively new technical solutions in the projects being developed. These technical innovations make it possible to compensate for inadequacies in maneuverability of fighters, and to raise the maneuverability of the missiles. For the time being, the missiles are distinguished by broader limits of launch zones, higher speeds, interference resistance, and probability of target kill, and short-range missiles also by high maneuverability and resistance to high G forces (up to 60). (INTERAVIA, 1984. No. 9; AIR FORCE, 1985. No. 4) The development of radars to control radars and also for other tasks holds a special place in scientific research and experimental design work abroad. The next-generation radars, designed for fighters on the basis of solid-state active-phased antenna arrays, their developers believe will be capable of operating simultaneously in several modes or of using all their energy in one mode, and will be part of a uniform system of flight and weapons control. In addition to radars, the designers will include in them IR sights, capable of detecting air targets at the same range as radars, electro-optic and navigation apparatus, multifunctional display assets, and aircraft and weapons control elements. Computers to assess the level of importance of detected targets, and rational launch zones of missiles, are also being developed. [FLIGHT, 1989. No. 4150] Such systems, which combine data sensors for tracking air targets with scopes and control elements, will allow the accomplishment of many functions: optimization of altitude and height of flight, offensive and defensive maneuvers of fighters, processing of sight data for fire, detection and tracking of targets with automatic lock-on of the nearest of them. They will free the pilot of the need to perform these functions, and will permit the most favorable maneuver in an air-to-air battle. Further increase in the range of detection of air targets, particularly those with reduced cross section, will remain one of the basic traditional directions in the development of radars of the new generation. This is understandable: the first to see the adversary gains victory. The designers strive to increase the power of radiation of the radars using, along with the pulsed mode, the pulsed-Doppler mode with coherent processing of signals and high frequency of repetition of the pulses. All these ways of increasing the range of action of radars have been known for a long time, but today no potentials are being identified in them. It is very important to detect a target in a timely manner, but this is not everything. What pilot does not know how much precious time can be lost when after detecting a target, you don't know its affiliation and characteristics! After all, on the radar screens of modern fighters, the blips of all aircraft are identical, and the type and composition of a target can be judged only approximately, from the range of appearance of the blip on the screen. But the existing systems of "friend or foe" determine only the affiliation of a target, and even here the reliability is inadequate. They cannot be relied upon during active electronic warfare of the sides. Therefore the fighters will be tied down in their actions, and must refrain from delivering fire at ranges safe for them and most convenient for engaging the adversary. Thus the pilot may clearly observe the blips of the air targets a good hundred kilometers away, but can neither make a decision nor open fire, no matter how long-range his missiles. In order to prevent engagement of friendly aircraft, he must close with the adversary for visual identification from external markings. But the more powerful and the longer the range of the weapons, the more fluid the situation in battle, the greater the need for full identification of air targets. Timely identification of air targets was a serious problem for all generations of fighters. However today the prospects for resolving this problem, in the opinion of western specialists, is more remote than ever before. Searches for reliable means of identification are being conducted in the air forces of many countries. Different methods and devices are being sought to determine the type of targets, distinguish individual aircraft in dense combat formations, and discern their location in groups. Special devices for high-speed processing of radar signals, systems based on programmable processors, whose memory contains a whole group of emissions of equipment of the probable enemy, are being developed for analysis of target signs in the U.S. At the same time, equipment is being developed to discover the specific modulation of reflected signals for each type of aircraft due to the rotation of engine compressor blades. English specialists have great hopes for optical devices aimed at air targets using a radar, with subsequent conversion of the optical image to a television image. [FLIGHT, 1986. No. 4011] Still, despite these innovations, seasoned experts shake their heads doubtfully. They believe that one of the basic and most reliable methods of identifying air targets in the future will continue to be continuous observation of their actions, beginning with takeoff, or from that part of air space where there are no friendly aircraft ("indirect identification of state affiliation"). In other words, a combination of long-range radar detection and identification of targets is predicted to have an important role. (INTERNATIONAL DEFENSE REVIEW, 1986. No. 8) But is this really the solution to the problem? Such are the basic characteristic features of the new generation of fighter aircraft. However there is another tendency becoming evident, which must be considered to make the assessment of the state of the future aircraft inventory of fighter aviation complete. The fact is that construction of fundamentally new types of fighters will demand great economic expenses and a long time, and then with the presence of a large inventory of already developed aircraft. However it has been noted that in the current types now, it is not so much the design as the engines, armaments, and equipment which are growing old. Naturally the efforts of the aircraft designers are directed also toward modernization of earlier adopted aircraft now in serial production, along with development of new designs. Western specialists believe that this tendency will continue to be completely valid in the future. It will make it possible to ensure an increment in the combat capabilities of fighters with the least expense. For many years the characteristics of familiar American fighters F-15 and F-16, adopted in the armament in 1972 and 1976, have been continuously improved. Their modifications have included new engines, improved radars, missiles, EW equipment, and navigational equipment. The program of modernization of the F-4F and "Tornado" aircraft in the FRG has been actively implemented. Plans are to replace some of the onboard electronic equipment and arm them with AMRAAM and HARM missiles. (INTERNATIONAL DEFENSE REVIEW, 1986. No. 8; AVIATION WEEK, 1987. No. 6.) Western experts predict, and have no doubt, that they will surely become part of the aircraft inventory by the end of the century. 4. New-Generation Fighters in Battle The problems of tactics of the air-to-air battle on the threshold of the year 2000 attract our attention no less than the development of fighters of the next generation. Attempts of pilots to fly the new or modified aircraft with their old tactical baggage will not bring success, for they will not be able to fully realize the high combat capabilities of the new equipment. Today the foundations of air-to-air combat are undergoing critical analysis and revision. Western specialists stress that for fighters with higher performance, powerful armaments, and highly automated systems, which open up for the pilots previously unattained possibilities, and offering great hopes, nonetheless the basic rules of air-to-air combat, developed and reinforced in past wars, will remain in force. Therefore foreign experts are oriented toward battles combining both new and old elements to some degree. On this basis, the foreign press states that the regions of air-to- air battles may have to be greater in size, or they may be fought in a limited space. Their participants may be either single fighters, or subunits operating according to a uniform concept. However the more improved aircraft and their weapons systems will entail more decisive targets, higher activeness of the opposing sides, and diversity of tactical techniques. This is why the old techniques, which have demonstrated their effectiveness, will not die away, but will grow into new ones, flowing from the capabilities of the equipment, which must be expanded and deepened even more. But what properties of the aircraft underlie such tactical techniques? First of all, the high thrust and capability of controlling aerodynamic forces. The high thrust of new-generation fighters imposes its own features on the air-to-air battle, changing the role of the altitude advantage over the adversary and the nature of maneuvers. In the past the altitude advantage resolved a great deal. Descending to join battle, the fighters could increase their speed, could quickly catch up with the adversary, assume a favorable position, and conduct a surprise attack. When located below the adversary, they were deprived of this opportunity. The energy of the aircraft did not allow such maneuvers. But now thanks to their enormous thrust, the pilots at lower altitude than the adversary can quickly climb, can speed up not only in descent, and also conduct other maneuvers without preliminary climbs. Now the possibility of achieving surprise has become inversely proportional to altitude. The one flying higher is visible on the radar screen the farthest away, and has a harder time detecting a target against the background of the earth. The capabilities of controlling aerodynamic forces in turn affect the nature of maneuver in an air-to-air battle. Short-radius turns, combat banks [razvorot], steep loops [petlya] and other similar traditional maneuvers, the components of tactical techniques, now may be supplemented by fundamentally new ones mentioned earlier: flat turns (without roll), and ascent and descent without a change in angle of pitch. Let us assume that in the dynamics of battle we need to aim quickly and precisely, and for this we need to change the attitude of our aircraft within small limits ("steer the nose"). What must the pilot do? A rapid turn [dovorot] to the target (or away from it), launch of missiles and fire of cannon, and then restoration of the previous attitude. Such combat maneuvers make it possible not only to simplify and increase the zone of engagement of the weapons aimed forward, but may also confuse the adversary. New weapons also make their contribution toward the tactics of the air battle. Fighters armed with missiles with various ranges of action will be able to fight at long, medium, and short range, to engage the adversary maneuvering with high G forces, from any direction. The classical scheme, combining maneuver and fire while trying to get on one another's tail and close to minimal range, under such conditions loses its dominant importance, while head-on attack, allowing maximum range of missile launch, on the contrary, will become more preferable. Such attacks even quite recently appeared to be impossible. Not even the bravest air warrior could manage to aim and hit a target without having long-range missiles at his disposal. Now closure can be at a trajectory close to straight. The air-to-air battle has become an all-aspect one. For this reason, foreign military specialists believe, not without justification, that the capabilities of missiles will exert a greater influence on the nature of future battles than the performance of the aircraft. However some of them go further and assume that when each fighter has powerful weapons, the need will disappear for a joint buildup of efforts, and thus for a group battle of fighters. Duel situations, in their opinion, will prove to be more expedient, because they do not limit the maneuver and combat might of the wingmen. (PROCEEDINGS, 1984. January.) Is this so? The tactics of aerial duelists or a group air-to-air battle with its fire interaction in the group? The majority of military specialists abroad conclude that a single fighter even with the most powerful weapons will not be able to engage all the enemy aircraft in a large group target; in addition his aft hemisphere will be unprotected. But this means that the battle formation of fighters would consist of assault and support elements (escort, reserve, decoy, etc.), combined under a single command. Of course, great doubts are expressed today about the need for a decoy element. It is thought that new-generation fighters with powerful weapons cannot permit themselves such a "luxury." Naturally, besides the multiple aircraft battle, there will continue to be duel situations, but they can occur only under difficult meteorological conditions, and even in the course of a multiple-aircraft air-to-air battle. In considering the standard variants of battle formations of sub-units, western experts conclude that for complete use of the capabilities of friendly weapons and ensurance of freedom of maneuver, before battle the fighters should move further and further away from one another, and the battle formations should disperse more and more widely. And the fighting strength of aircraft combined in a single group may be reduced. Here the traditional functions of leader and wingman require vital clarification in the smallest subunits -- pairs of fighters. (AIR FORCE, 1986. No. 4) If the leader attacks a target, the wingman only monitors the air situation and covers his leader; he frequently returns to the airfield with his combat load unexpended. Fighters of the new generation also need to be divided into leaders and wingmen, but in order to rationally utilize all the power of their weapons, they would do better to move in an opon battle formation, close to the front, and both must be in readiness to attack. The one to attack the target will be the one in a more advantageous position. It will become the attacker, and the second pilot the covering element. The covering fighter then builds on the efforts of the attacking one. Let us follow the dynamics of the standard air-to-air battle, in which foreign military specialists try to find new, non-standard solutions. In their opinion, the battle should be started from maximum range by active group attacks, in order to immediately scatter the battle formation of the adversary and reduce to naught his numerical superiority. However even an adversary possessing roughly the same destructive capabilities of his weapons will strive for analogous attacks. Therefore the initial tactical superiority will remain with the group or pilot who is able to first detect the adversary, assess the situation earlier, make a decision, and shift more rapidly to the attack. But what tactical techniques are expedient in a first attack, which was earlier valued highly, and with the increase in power of fighter weapons, and the low effectiveness of repeat attacks, is acquiring decisive importance? One such technique, albeit familiar, but somewhat altered for new fighters, may be closing with the target at a height lower than the expected height of the target, with a subsequent surprise attack from the front and below. Then the adversary will be in a worse position, since the range of detection of his radar will be less against the background of the earth, and he will be deprived of the capability of a first attack. Still, inconspicuous fighters, with a significantly reduced radar cross section and intensity of IR emission will have the best opportunities for a surprise attack. The range of detection of such fighters by onboard radars of enemy aircraft, according to the foreign press, will be reduced to 20-25 km, and the lock-on range to 15 km. The range of lock-on of targets by missiles with active homing heads, not receiving stable signals from inconspicuous aircraft, will be reduced accordingly. (AVIATION WEEK, 1988. No. 11) Therefore the pilots who first detect the adversary will be able to covertly close with him and attack him first (Figure 30). Figure 30. Inconspicuous fighters armed with AMRAAM missiles on the attack Here one interesting circumstance arises. If the opposing side has similar inconspicuous fighters, the battle of the "invisibles," western specialists believe, will acquire quite a different nature and will require other tactical techniques. Here the attacks on the forward hemisphere will be extremely difficult due to the short range of detection of the targets, and all the features of close air-to-air combat, when fighters still did not have radar sights, or long-range missiles, will come to the fore. A return to the past? In some ways, yes! The tactical techniques of joining battle should allow the fighters not only to detect the adversary first, but also to engage the maximum number of targets. Here new missiles with active homing systems will come to the fore, which do not require illumination of the enemy aircraft, whose launch from each fighter is possible almost simultaneously against several targets (AMRAAM). The first attack of inconspicuous fighters using such missiles, possessing the property of "fire and forget," will immediately acquire new features. Its concept may be as follows: upon detecting a target or group of targets, pilots will begin covert closure with them. The group commander will distribute individual enemy aircaft among the wingmen in order to avoid multiple engagement of them (it is recommended that the commander himself select the most important target). One necessary digression. In order to distribute targets correctly, the command must know precisely the number and location of the enemy planes in the group. When the commander does not see it visually, and when there are conditions of a difficult jamming situation, this is not easy to do. Therefore, as long as the fighters do not have reliable devices to identify targets, they require additional information, which may be sent to them from a ground or airborne command post. After distribution of targets among the pilots, each distributes the missiles on board among the earmarked planes. Then there remains little to do: execute the launch and "forget" the missiles, and then execute an evasive maneuver in order to avoid retaliatory fire. The attack is maximally simplified. Then the commander organizes a repeat attack against targets which survive the first, or the pilots begin to search for other targets. (PROCEEDINGS. 1984. January; AIR FORCE, 1985, No. 4) However an air-to-air battle will scarcely have the nature of an exchange of missile strikes only from long range. The adversary may obtain timely information, and then he will do everything in order to create a powerful electronic counteraction, to "blind" the pilots, to hamper them in using a specific type of missile, and to foil his long-range strike. One cannot underestimate his capabilities, especially with respect to inconspicuous fighters, in achieving surprise, when they turn up at close range, ruling out the use of long-range missiles. One should not forget the difficulty of instrument identification of targets. And indeed, the pilots themselves may aim poorly or commit other errors, so that long-range attacks prove unsuccessful. What happens if the whole reserve of long-range missiles is expended in the battle? In all these cases an air-to-air battle started at long range may then become a close-range combat. Close-range air-to-air combat played a decisive role in local wars of the 70s and 80s. Thus in the Arab-Israeli War of 1973, the Israeli pilots shot down 310 of the 450 Arab planes they destroyed in close-range combat. (INTERNATIONAL DEFENSE REVIEW, 1985, No. 8) And even though, in the opinion of some western observers, there will be no place for such battles in the future (it will be more advantageous for fighters to return to the airfield and top off their missile reserve than to continue to close with targets), the close-in battles themselves stubbornly ignore their lack of recognition, and the latest concepts. What is more, recently an instruction was introduced to the program of training of NATO tactical pilots regarding conclusion of each training flight for air-to-air combat with energetic maneuvering as applied to the conditions of close-range combat. (PROCEEDINGS, 1984. January) The main distinguishing characteristics of close-range combat, which will basically retain its former aspect, will be visual contact between the planes fighting the battle, and the use of short-range weapons. At the same time, new features will inevitably appear: a speeding up of battle dynamics, a reduction in the time between attacks, an increase in the probability of a kill of aircraft of the opposing sides. In aircraft with high thrust-to-weight ratios and acceleration characteristics, possessing missiles with autonomous guidance after launch, the pilots may more quickly conclude attacks, restore lost speed, and catch up with an adversary fleeing attack. These new features not only expand the capabilities of the fighters, but also make combat more dangerous for all of its participants. It has become much easier to kill a target, but also more difficult to defend oneself. Here the danger of collision has grown, especially in attacks at high aspect angles. In accordance with the changed conditions of air-to-air combat, pilots are required to use new tactical techniques, combining sharp maneuvers of short duration with the attainment of high acceleration. Such techniques, based on control of aerodynamic forces, create the most favorable conditions for precise fire with cannon, and for missile launch. But despite the most clever maneuvers, even well-trained pilots may lose the battle at its very start, if they do not combine these maneuvers with electronic suppression of weapons sights and homing heads of the enemy missiles. There is still no alternative to electronic warfare. Switch-on of active jammers, dispensing of dipole reflects, and firing of IR decoys to disrupt missile guidance and lure them in false directions, these pilot actions must vitally supplement the picture of the battle of tommorrow's fighters. * * * The tactics of fighter aviation involve complex combat equipment, and with each new type of aircraft and weapon, it must seek new tactical techniques which are frequently dissimilar to, and sometimes unique in past practice. If you put a pilot of a future fighter in the cockpit of a MiG-23, say, I don't know how he would do. There is no computer, to which he has grown accustomed, no display with precise information on the tactical situation either, maneuvers based on high thrust-to-weight ratio and control of aerodynamic forces are impossible. Under such conditions the pilot would simply be unable to fight. Perhaps this is an ingenuous comparison, but it does give food for thought. For if you think about it, how eloquent here the manifestation of interrelations of tactics and outmoded equipment. Therefore, if we try to look into the 21st century, then will we become witnesses, and perhaps even participants in the new contradictions between tactics and equipment. In order to resolve these contradictions and realize the high potential capabilities of new-generation fighters, we will also need to resolve other difficult problems, one of which is the air adversary and his tactics. Chapter III. In Sharp Confrontation with Offensive Aviation Bombers and fighters... It is a good seven decades now since they came into the world, and for all these decades have been fraught with the sharp confrontation between them. The interrelations determining their development and improvement are familiar. The very advent of the bombers called the fighter to life, and it in turn led to the mounting of defensive weapons on bombers, to the armoring of vulnerable points, to the protection of gas tanks. Development of the defensive assets of bombers brought forth further improvement in the armament of fighters: the transition from machine-guns to cannon, then to missiles. But similar relationships existed and exist between aviation delivering strikes on troops and rear installations (let us call it offensive aviation) and fighter aviation protecting them from air strikes. The changes in tactics of one of the sides will always entail the corresponding changes in the tactics of the other. In tracing this dialectical, law-governed regularity, which has been manifested quite clearly for many decades, we can judge the development of the tactics of fighter aviation, considering it within the framework of the general air defense system with which the fighters jointly repel the raids of the air adversary. 1. Under the Onslaught of Offensive Aviation The confrontation of Soviet fighter aviation and the Hitlerite Luftwaffe began literally in the first minutes of the Great Patriotic War, when the fascist bombers hit hard at our cities and military installations. In the very first days of the war, acting almost with impunity, the enemy was able to inflict severe damage on troops and rear installations and the system of air defense itself. There were many reasons for such catastrophic consequences of the air strikes. Much has been said and written about these reasons. Military historians note that right on the eve of war, the advent of bomber aircraft in the air forces of fascist Germany which were more dangerous than their predecessors, and the mass nature of their use significantly improved the chances of the aviation in battle against air defense. Of course the natural lag of defensive means behind offensive means, although it did exist, was not the only reason for the situation that had been created. Much postwar literature stresses the aggressor's material superiority in forces, and his use of the factor of surprise. The dramatic picture of disorganization and haplessness of the air defense, including fighter aviation, in the repulse of first massed enemy raids is explained by omissions in the training of the Armed Forces for war, military-political errors of the leadership, and the significant combat experience of the Hitlerite aviation, which had been able to practice the suppression of air defense systems of European countries and was cloaked in an aura of invincibility. (At the start of the Second World War, massed air strikes against Polish airfields, antiaircraft positions, and command and control centers, in which the attack of 2,000 Luftwaffe planes was opposed by about 140 fighters, had the result that the air defense system of Poland virtually ceased to exist in the very first days of the war. As a result of such massed strikes on French, Dutch, and Belgian airfields, where a large number of fighters were destroyed, the aggressor was able to shift to delivery of strikes on other targets without significant resistance of the fighter aviation of these countries (HISTORY OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, 1939-1945. Vol. 3. M.: Voyenizdat, 1974)) All these things are true, of course. But publications pay significantly less attention to the tactical aspects of the confrontation of fighter aviation with the air adversary, which was also an important cause of the failures. Fascist bombers operated at low and medium altitudes (from 500 to 3,000 meters) in large groups, almost without fighter cover, made so-called "star raids," arriving at their targets from different directions, and repeated the raids several times. What could fighter aviation do to oppose them? Low in numbers because of losses inflicted on the ground, and inferior to the enemy in tactical performance of the aircraft, it was committed to battle too late and discredited itself becuase of its rare appearances over protected targets. Frontline fighters, even while on the airfields in immediate readiness for a sortie, did not have time to meet the enemy. Air defense fighters, possessing a longer enemy warning range than front-line fighters, often intercepted the enemy using data obtained from forward observation posts. However due to the unreliable warning system, most often the fighters had to continuously patrol in the air, hoping for an accidental encounter with the adversary. So their actions often proved unfruitful. All these defects and omissions had a negative affect on the confrontation of the sides, as, incidentally, on the air defense of other countries. Military specialists concluded that the aviation had passed the combat equipment and tactics of air defense in its development. While restraining with all its might the onslaught of offensive aviation, the fighters continuously revised and improved their tactics. Changes could not take place overnight, however. Before, the pilots had drawn their tactical wisdom from the experience of the past, but now every day brought such contradictory opinions, and confronted them with such unexpected problems that only through profound analysis of air situations could correct tactical recommendations be extracted from them. Proven tactical techniques, which were tested by bitter experience and had no analogues in the past, and the higher tactical performance of planes entering the armament of fighter aviation did their work, and further development of events proved a surprise to Hitlerite aviation. Its massed raids were opposed by a concentration of fighters forced in decisive axes, and by more sophisticated tactical techniques. Already the tactics of offensive aviation were seen to lag behind those of fighter aviation. In order to even out the situation somewhat, the Hitlerites had to abandon the repeated raids on targets from different directions, which demanded a great expenditure of forces, and switched to actions in dense, less vulnerable battle formations. The bombers reached their targets while changing directions and altitudes, and, avoiding rote actions, sought to mislead the fighters. The crews of the aircraft planned their routes so as to create the impression that they were flying toward specific targets, but then at the last moment would suddenly change course and turn toward their planned targets. Another tactical technique was the delivery of diversionary strikes on secondary targets, while the main forces acted against the planned targets. Fighter protection of the "Junkers" and "Heinkels" was beefed up, and more forces began to be assigned to tie down our fighters in battle and blockade their airfields. Because of the dialectical relationship between offensive weapons and defensive ones, the confrontation between them in the subsequent course of battle ran with variable success. But it always favored the side which used new types of aircraft and concentrated large forces, allowed for the tactical innovations of the other side, and quickly introduced correctives to its own tactics in response to them. By the end of the war fighter aviation had been transformed into a terrifying adversary of fascist aviation. Possessing decisive superiority in forces, it operated in accordance with a uniform concept, and used maneuver of large forces extensively. Front-line fighters were the first to encounter the enemy, and their efforts were augmented by air defense aviation. Fascist aviation still continued its raids, but when encountering the opposition of fighter aviation, coordinated with respect to target, time, and space, it gradually reduced its activeness. Even such well-armed aircraft as the J-88 and He-111 could not break through to their targets without substantial losses. In confrontation with fighter aviation the enemy tried to concentrate the forces of his aviation in individual sectors by maneuver, creating special ace elements which arrived ahead of time in the regions of upcoming action. The bombers sought to reduce their time in regions within range of aviation, and increased bombing altitudes, but such new tactical elements reduced the effectiveness of strikes. Experience of the Great Patriotic War exerted a great influence on the nature of further confrontation between fighters and offensive aviation in the postwar years, but the adoption of nuclear weapons into the armament of the sides was a powerful stimulus for its development. When aviation had only conventional high-explosive and incendiary bombs, hundreds of bombers were necessary to destroy targets of average dimensions. If the air defense managed to keep the greater part of these bombers from reaching the target, it was considered to be successful, since the bombs dropped by the bombers breaking through to the target were insufficient to destroy it. With the advent of nuclear weapons, however, one plane armed with an atom bomb could take the place of more conventionally-armed bombers than any power in the world had, and its penetration to a major target threatened colossal destruction and countless victims. The tactics of aviation also changed radically. In massed flights instead of dense battle formations, all at once there were actions of a large number of single planes and small groups of planes, dispersed in front and in depth. The simultaneous appearance in the air of many independently operating targets approaching the strike objectives from different directions, in combination with jamming, put fighter aviation in a difficult situation. Single enemy aircraft, which before had seemed easy pickings for fighters, had become hard-to-kill, fast-moving, high-altitude targets. Foreign military specialists proved that it was a fantasy to think that all aircraft carrying nuclear weapons could be intercepted by existing air defense systems, given their limited capabilities against a simultaneous fighter attack, without fundamentally new air defense weapons and methods of their delivery, which of course did not yet exist. "The probability of destruction of aircraft must be the same at any point of a defended space," the French military journal FORCE ARMEE FRANCAISE noted. "As soon as the adversary discovers an unequal distribution of defensive assets, he will attack from a safe axis." (FORCE ARMEE FRANCAISE, 1973, No. 8, p 34.) This is why, due to that same dialectical relation between offensive and defensive weapons, the confrontation between fighter and offensive aviation flared up with new force in the mid 1950s. This was also because of the transition of aviation from piston aircraft to jet, with more sophisticated armaments. The development of aviation tactics in the very first postwar local wars occurred especially rapidly. As early as the Korean War, beginning in 1952, American aviation began to operate in a different way when encountering active opposition from the fighter aviation of the KPA [Korean People's Army]. They delivered strikes simultaneously against many objectives, using a large number of forces, and were supported by various disinformation measures in order to dissipate the efforts of the fighter aviation. Here is just one example. On 10 January 1953, about 300 tactical F-80 and F-84 fighters participated in a massed strike and delivered strikes on nine road and railroad bridges on the territory of the Korean People's Democratic Republic. The approach of the main forces to the lines of radar detection and their arrival at the targets were masked by jamming aircraft and by the suppression of radars in false axes, by transmission of false orders regarding the time and targets of strikes in aviation radio nets in clear text, and also by special decoy groups. (See: Stuart, J. Vozdushnaya moshch -- reshayushchaya sila v Koree [Air Power -- a Decisive Force in Korea). M., Foreign Literature Publishing House, 1959, p. 151) A serious impetus to the confrontation of tactics was provided by the aggressive U.S. war in Southeast Asia. Attempts of offensive aviation to operate without changing its prior tactics resulted in heavy losses. Of course, at the start of the war, taking advantage of the absence of an organized air defense, American aviation operated almost without hindrance, chiefly at medium altitudes, and the crews of the planes did not use any new tactical techniques. They differed little from actions against [practice) targets, which did not return fire. But what happened later on? Later a quite unexpected turn of events occurred. The aviation of the interventionists was not able to break through the missile barrier which appeared in the DRV [Democratic Republic of Vietnam] in 1965. In the first battle on 26 June, Vietnamese SAM systems shot down three F-4 Phantoms at one time. (Hai Thu. North Vietnam Versus the U.S. Air Force. Hanoi, 1968. p. 16) This had never happened before, or at least it was very rare. This lesson forced the offensive aviation to improve its tactics. The appearance of SAM systems inevitably provoked a response on its part. How could aircraft forced to enter the kill zones of the SAMs be protected? At first the efforts of military specialists were directed toward developing onboard apparatus to warn of the launch of SAMs and detect the missiles themselves. It was necessary to detect them at sufficiently great distances from the aircraft for the crews to have time to take protective steps, but attempts to develop such apparatus were not crowned by success. It was necessary to look for weak points in the air defense system, and to allocate significant forces for suppression, exceeding several times over the strength of the assault elements, and to develop means and tactics for combatting SAM systems. It was easiest to detect SAM systems from long range based on the operation of their target designation and missile guidance radars. So-called anti-radar aircraft appeared which were equipped with receiver/direction finders. They were supposed to determine the coordinates of the radar-targets and guide air-defense suppression elements to them. This was not a bad idea, but without the means to measure the range to the targets it was impossible to determine the precise location of the sources of radar emission, and triangulation methods had still not been mastered. Nor did it ensure simultaneous detection of several SAM systems and their guidance systems, the number of which continued to grow. More sophisticated anti-radar aircraft with improved apparatus for electronics intelligence (F4G Wild Weasel) were developed much later, with a lag of some fifteen years behind the level of development of air defense. It was also necessary to have some means of engaging the SAM systems, also from long range. These were the Shrike anti-radar missiles, which homed in on the operating radars. These missiles were used for the first time in Vietnam, but had short range (14-16 km), and when the radar stations were switched off by the SAM crews they were knocked off course, and even retargeted themselves on their own against other more powerful energy sources. A result of ignoring this fact was that one day a Shrike missile hit a shipboard radar of the American cruiser "Warden" in the Tonkin Gulf instead of the Vietnamese SAM system. The former was put out of commission and was sent to the Philippines for repairs. The airborne EW assets grew more and more diverse, but control of them was manual and each operated in isolation. Even in their aggregate they could no longer ensure effective counteraction to the operation of air defense electronic systems. Another circumstance also arose for aviation. When cannon were replaced by air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles, with their powerful warheads and high firing accuracy, the problem of survival of aircraft in the air was exacerbated. Survival became as important as speed, maneuverability, and other characteristics. This was mentioned in chapter II, but it is important to stress it again, because the ways of enhancing survival listed in Table 1 could no longer save aviation from the deadly fire of SAM systems and fighters. The problem had to be solved not so much in the military-technical context as in the tactical context. Since the whole group of counteractive means and tactical techniques of crews was exhausted and did not bring the expected results, foreign military scientists and designers directed their efforts toward increasing the range of airborne weapons in order to preclude the entry of the aircraft into the kill zones of the SAM systems. This was a reassuring direction in the struggle against them. The results were the gliding guided aerial bombs and missiles with electro-optical and, later on, laser guidance. Tactical techniques were also developed, whose essence boiled down to using different deceptive maneuvers for covert approach to bomb release and missile launch lines. It seemed that a way out of the critical situation had been found: aviation could deliver strikes on targets without entering the SAM zones, or at least could spend minimal amount of time in them. Now air defense was in a difficult situation, and all the burden of combatting the airborne platforms of the new weapons was carried by fighter aviation. 2. History Repeats Itself One encounters surprising coincidences in the history of tactics. Strange as it may seem, in tracing the process of the confrontation of fighter aviation with the air enemy, at times we run into one and the same, seemingly long resolved problems, which have cropped up again. One of them, for example, was the battle with offensive aviation at low altitudes. At first glance it would seem that there was nothing new here. Fighters were repelling strikes from ground-hugging altitude back in the Second World War. However in flight at an altitude of several hundred meters, under the radar "lobes," the time of approach and deployment of the aircraft in the vectoring regions of the fighters grew so limited that there could be no question of timely intercept of targets. Beside this, difficulties lay in wait for pilots at low altitudes. On the one hand, due to the limited range of detection of aviation, they could not climb in time, and, on the other, even if they did manage to do so, the control centers would not have time to guide them toward enemy aircraft, and the pilots would have to search them out themselves. But how can one look for low-flying targets if the screens of the airborne scopes are filled with ground clutter? Interception was also hindered by restrictions on speed, maneuverability, and increased fuel expenditure in fighters, and difficulties in piloting. According to statistical data, more than 50 percent of air accidents in the U.S. Air Force occurring through the fault of the pilots during the day, under visual flight conditions, occurred at low altitudes, while performing turns or horizontal maneuvers, while their flight time at an altitude of 300 meters or less made up only 10 percent of total flight time. (AVIATION WEEK, 1985. No. 1) This is why during the war in Vietnam and in subsequent local wars, the use of low altitudes by aviation, where it could covertly approach objectives and attack them with surprise, became most important in tactics. By hugging the ground to reduce the possible range of detection, and by using special apparatus allowing prolonged flight with terrain following and obstacle avoidance, the crews could operate under any weather conditions day or night, and deliver strikes without visual contact with the targets. This is why the air defense, in retaliation, began to organize unbroken low-altitude radar fields, create a special system to warn of the flight of low-flying targets, began to modernize sights and weapons, and improve the tactical techniques of fighters. Nonetheless, the problem of timely detection of low-flying targets became the main one, and the most complex, for fighter aviation. Subsequently it developed into the independent problem of all-weather long-range aircraft detection, and rapid warning of all forces and assets of air defense. We have already considered this problem in examining the confrontation of fighter aviation with fascist aviation, but history has repeated itself. The fact is that as the flight speeds of aircraft and the launch range of airborne weapons have increased, it has become necessary for fighters to repel air raids at longer and longer range from defended objectives. As long as these speeds were relatively low and aviation did not have guided bombs and missiles, the limited capabilities of ground radars with respect to range of detection were not so important. But now aviation was approaching the sound barrier, and fighter aviation, despite the growth of combat capabilities, was no longer able to commit adequate battle forces to repel raids not only at low altitudes, but at other altitudes as well, and could not realize the tactical radius of fighters to combat aviation at the maximal ranges of their fuel reserve. To increase the range of detection of aviation, the efforts of designers and engineers of many countries were directed toward raising the power of radar transmitters and improving the sensitivity of receiving devices, toward changing the types of antennas, and putting them on hills and high masts. As a result new models of radars appeared, with better resolution and resistance to jamming, and higher accuracy in determining target coordinates. But what of range of operation? Alas, it increased comparatively little. It became clear that the problem would be hard to resolve in that way. It proved possible to radically increase the range of detection by mounting radars on airborne platforms: planes, helicopters, and dirigibles. Here the radar antennas were put on a kilometer-high hill, so to speak. However only those radars which used the pulsed-Doppler method, which makes it possible to follow aerial targets against the background of the ground or water surface, could be "raised to the sky." To do this it was necessary to solve a number of purely technical problems, i.e., to develop special antennas and control apparatus, reduce their mass and size, and seek out new methods of detection of fast and low-altitude targets. In this regard, in the development of airborne platforms, their capabilities for carrying radar equipment were considered more important than their tactical performance. The basic requirements were merely high carrying capacity and flight time. As a result of years of research and development begun in the 60s, radar early warning aircraft equipped with surveillance radars were designed, and the efforts of the military industry abroad were concentrated on development of whole aircraft systems for long-range radar detection and control. Such a system (AWACS) was developed at the end of the 70s in the U.S. Possessing E-3A aircraft (Figure 31--[not reproduced]) equipped with powerful radars, high-speed computers, and equipment for processing and transmission of information and for situation display, it still continues to operate without vital changes in functions in the air defense system of the North American continent and in the armed forces of the NATO bloc. Adoption of airborne early warning aircraft in the air defense systems, and their mass use, drastically changed the situation in favor of fighter aviation. The radar field immediately shifted to the depth of the territory of the opposing side, and continuous surveillance of the air situation and control of fighters over an enormous depth was ensured, not only at high altitude, but at low as well. Thus, according to the data of the foreign press, the aforementioned AWACS system allows surveillance of air space over an area of 31,000 sq. km, detection of aerial targets and guidance of fighters at ranges of up to 600 km at high altitudes, and up to 400 km at low. Here it is possible to detect up to 600 targets and track 250 of them. (AIR FORCE MAGAZINE, 1984, No. 6) Behind these numbers stands the whole problem, with aspects reassuring to fighter aviation and alarming to offensive aviation. On the one hand, the necessary range of detection of aviation and timely scrambling of fighters to repel its raids were achieved, and their control during commitment to battle and in battle were assured, while on the other hand the capabilities of aviation to achieve covertness and surprise of action became problematic. In addition, airborne radar systems became in themselves more survivable. Ground radars had permanent coordinates which could be determined ahead of time by aviation even in those cases when they were not operating. But airborne radars were mobile and could elude the sight of the adversary by ceasing operation and changing location. Airborne early warning and control systems, allowing detection of targets against ground clutter, seemingly made it ill-advised for aviation to approach the targets of a strike at low altitude -- the only tactical technique allowing crews to evade the detection by radar. After all, all other techniques demanded preliminary suppression of air defense assets in the zone of flight. It seemed that an insurmountable barrier had been put in the way of aviation. Fighter pilots sighed in relief: the onslaught of aviation had been reliably repulsed. But their joy was premature. Aviation quickly reacted to the next innovation, and other ways to accomplish their missions were found. One such way was the use of early warning and control aircraft by aviation in its own interests. First efforts in this direction were taken back in Vietnam in raids by American strategic bombers on the cities of Hanoi and Haiphong. Along with the bombers, or somewhat ahead of them, EC-121K "Warning Star" and E-2A "Hawkeye" aircraft took off to perform the functions of airborne command posts. They conducted surveillance of the air situation, warned the crews of the approach of Vietnamese fighters, and issued target designations to their fighters, F-4 Phantoms. Later on, in 1982, early-warning aircraft, now the E-2C Hawkeye, were used extensively in Israel's aggression in Lebanon. (AIR FORCE, 1986, No. 4) Another such method, which appeared in the Arab-Israeli war of 1973, was the sharp increase in electronic warfare (EW). The tactics of aviation in combatting fighter aviation were marked by the variety of the EW assets used. Combined jamming (active noise, response-pulse jamming, and passive jamming) were used against command and control centers and airborne weapons radars, both by special jammers and by combat aircraft. Dipole reflectors and IR decoys were used against missiles with radar and heat-seeking homing heads. Electronic warfare was used even more in Lebanon, where Israeli aviation first laid down massive jamming in the region of combat action, then delivered strikes under its cover against the SAM positions and actively jammed the fighter's command and control centers and the fighters in the air, and only then did the assault elements enter the region. All this resulted in almost complete disruption of the command and control of fighter aviation, and offensive aviation accomplished its missions without significant losses. (AIR FORCE, 1982, No. 7; MILITARY TECHNOLOGY, 1984, No. 7) In the comparatively small and brief military conflict of the U.S. in Libya in March-April 1986, events developed analogously, but the air tactics were structured on a more sophisticated technical foundation. Before the start of the American air raids, Libya's air defense system was carefully reconnoitered by reconnaissance satellites and early warning aircraft, and active and passive jamming of great intensity was directed against ground radars, homing heads, and radar proximity fuses of missiles. New high-speed (up to M 3.5) HARM missiles, equipped with broadband homing heads which "memorized" the direction of the radar after it was switched off, replaced the Shrike anti-radar missiles. Launch range of the missiles had reached 80 km, and the crews could use them without entering the kill zones of the SAM systems. Subsequently the anti-radar aircraft, or Wild Weasel system, which had earned its right to exist back in Vietnam, experienced a rebirth. They directed the search of radar targets, selected the most dangerous of them, and issued target designations to air defense suppression elements. Cluster bombs and anti-radar missiles began to be mounted on these aircraft, and new elements in crew tactics were noted. Anti-radar aircraft were to be the first to begin suppressing the air defense, without entering the kill zone of the SAMs, and jointly with combat aircraft to support flight to the targets of the assault elements, creating safe corridors for penetration to the planned targets. In turn the pilots masked the launch of anti-radar missiles with jamming, and they were often able to achieve surprise. All this reduced the survivability of air defenses, and prevented them from rapidly restoring combat readiness. It seemed that the air defense system could no longer stand up to the indestructible onslaught of aviation. But one has to know dialectics. It seeks and finds ways out of the most hopeless situations. Attainments of aviation in the field of electronic warfare sharply exacerbated the confrontation of tactics and lent new stimulus to the development of EW assets of the opposing side. Radar jamming, decoy targets? But there are other ways of combatting them. There were new studies and experiments, and then air defense had other electronic systems with greater energy potential, phased-array radar antennas, and more reliable receiving devices with enhanced signal-processing quality using super high-speed integrated circuits. Anti-radar missiles? These were countered by long-range SAM systems, which pushed the missile platforms to the limits of their launch, radar emitters which guided the missiles out of their trajectory, and various deceptive and masking measures. Jamming equipment appeared on the fighters themselves. Other EW assets were developed and improved, and became part of the air defense elements. Electronic warfare ceased to be conducted unilaterally, only by aviation. These attainments in raising the interference resistance of air defense systems were so great that they gave ground for the claims of military experts that assets as anti-radar reflectors and transmitters, emitting noise and response-pulse jamming, would soon become ineffective. And aviation? Indeed, it had difficulty suppressing all air defense assets. Their number reached astronomical figures. Radars of different bands, pulsed and pulsed-doppler with different methods of protection against jamming, they filled the air with millions of pulses per second. It was necessary to select and suppress those of them which posed the immediate threat. Meanwhile a new barrier had arisen before fighter aviation, and a new enemy became visible -- cruise missiles. I should say at once that history again repeated itself, these missiles were already familiar weapons. Their prototypes were known back in the second World War (the FAU-1 aircraft-projectiles) and were developed in the U.S. in the postwar years ("Regulus," "Snark," "Mace") but interest in them declined with the advent of intercontinental ballistic missiles. Development of cruise missiles was renewed many years later, only in the mid-70s, when development of science and technology made it possible to create small gas-turbine engines ensuring a low specific consumption of fuel, to reduce dimensions and mass of the missiles, and to raise the accuracy of the guidance systems. The number of types of missiles under development increased swiftly, and their range and accuracy grew. Back in 1978 the U.S. conducted first experimental launches of the "Tomahawk" tactical missiles against ground targets (TLAM-C), in 1979, from ground launchers (GLCM), and in 1980 strategic cruise missiles, launched from aircraft, appeared (ALCM). Fitted with inertial guidance systems, supporting their flight to targets at maximally low altitudes, and armed with nuclear or conventional warheads, cruise missiles could reach targets several hundred to several thousand kilometers away. (INTERAVIA, 1981, No. 12). Following the cruise missiles, drones (BLA) joined the battle against fighter aviation. Subsonic and supersonic, with a mass from 90 kg to 4.5 t, they were intended for the conduct of reconnaissance, radioelectronic suppression, the delivery of strikes against air defense assets, and correction of artillery fire. The low cost of these drones makes it possible to use them on a mass scale, and their small size also makes them less vulnerable to air defense weapons. Such properties of cruise missiles and drones again put the fighters and all air defense in a difficult position. After all, the radar cross section of these aerial targets was so low that on the screens of ground radars and onboard weapons sights they appear scarcely noticeable, now flickering, now disappearing, now merging with "ground clutter," now points lost in the jamming. The tactics of Israeli aviation relied on precisely these properties of drones in 1973 and in the armed conflict in Lebanon in 1982. Using drones, they first determined the location and parameters of operation of the air defense assets of the Arab countries, and then launched strikes against them with piloted aircraft. Here the drones were used to lay down a curtain of dipole reflectors and as dummy targets to provoke the SAM complexes and antiaircraft artillery to open fire. (NATO's FIFTEEN NATIONS, 1985, August). The first drones were shot down by fighters back in Vietnam (Figure 32 [not reproduced]), but the experience obtained demonstrated that to combat such qualitatively different, small targets required a different approach, different assets for their detection and identification, weapons which had a very short reaction time, increased accuracy and rate of fire. And again one detected a lag of fighter aviation behind the level of development of offensive air weapons, and again it was faced with the need of further development of tactics on the basis of new equipment. But after all, the means of defense will not appear before the means of offense. The conflict between offense and fighter aviation breaks out with new force. What can fighters use to oppose their adversary today? Tracing the paths of development of tactics of the opposing sides, based on what has already occurred, we will now make a few generalizations, and analyze how this objective law-governed regularity is manifested today, and sketch a "portrait" of the offensive aviation with which our fighters must be ready to join in battle, recalling that it will be a joint battle with ground air defense assets. 3. Who Must Fighters Fight Today As any complex phenomenon, the tactics of present-day aviation include many components. In their content one can distinguish first of all the changes in the disposition and combat formations of groups, profiles of flight to the targets of a strike and tactical techniques to attain secrecy and suppress air defense, and, very importantly, two different tendencies: --penetration to the strike objectives on the principle of "force"; --avoidance of action of forces and resources of air defense of the adversary. Of course these tendencies are not new, but judging from the views of the NATO military leaders, and the experience of exercises, and also the most recent local wars and military conflicts, they are acquiring new content. Penetration to the strike objectives on the principle of "force" presupposes engagement and radioelectronic suppression of air defense assets. They are precisely what give rise to the intensity of the conflict and the absence of compromise of positions of the opposing sides in that reality which had developed by the start of the 90s. And the reality for aviation is dispiriting -- the problem of its overcoming air defense is to this point considered unresolved, and consists of ensuring flight through overlapping SAM envelopes of an enormous number of SAM complexes and overcoming the barrier of powerful fighter aviation armed with long-range air-to-air missiles and capable of performing day or night under any weather conditions. Therefore, in the opinion of foreign military specialists, no aviation might will allow it to accomplish a single combat mission if the entire air defense system of the opposing side is not first destroyed. There was no such precept in the past. Then the suppression of air defense assets was a secondary and even passing problem for aviation, but this was because such a powerful defensive system did not exist either. This is why aviation is forced to devote primary attention to the conflict with air defense, despite the fact that it demands the exertion of great efforts, reduces the power of strikes, and complicates its structuring. From overcoming the air defenses (a concept which suggests only partial suppression of the air defenses and various flanking maneuvers), aviation is shifting to a breakthrough of the air defenses, i.e., penetration to the objectives on the principle of "force." The tactics of aviation in the breakthrough of air defenses consists of using specially assigned elements to combat the air defenses with and jamming to make "corridors" for passage of the assault elements to the targets. Here initially aircraft and drones suppress the defense from zones bordering the breakthrough sectors, deliver strikes jointly with air- and ground-launched missiles against radar posts, air defense command and control centers, SAM positions and fighter airfields, and then the assault elements proceed to their targets, and, in turn, jam the air defense assets from their battle formations. Fighters supporting the assault aviation are also part of the anti-air defense elements. They sweep the airspace on the flight paths of the assault elements, form barriers at approaches to the assault objectives, and their actions are strictly coordinated in place and time from the airborne command posts (AWACS). At the same time, in devising the tactics of offensive aviation, the military leaders of the NATO air forces to preserve its forces strive to optimally mass their efforts and reduce to a minimum the time spent on delivering massed assaults. This is a very vital circumstance. You see, the shorter the duration of the assaults, the less time the fighters will have to repel the raids, and some of them will not even have time to take off from their airfields. Under the conditions of intensive jamming, the surviving air defense assets will not have time to engage all aircraft involved in the assault either. In addition, massed use of aviation along with drones and missiles may lead to an oversaturation of the air defense system with various aerial targets, and it will cease to cope with its data processing. This will also be furthered by changes in the disposition of aviation in massed assaults. With the adoption of precision weapons and new target designation equipment, the battle formations will consist of small elements: two or four, more rarely eight aircraft each. A short massed assault with very high density in narrow breakthrough corridors, combined with heavy fire and radioelectronic countering action -- this according to foreign military experts is how the tactics of offensive aviation are seen in the conflict with air defense. However penetration to the assault objectives on the principle of "force" when hundreds of planes and other aircraft are concentrated in the air in a limited space, and for a short time, is the enemy of surprise, and naturally cannot remain unnoticed by the opposing side. Therefore it is considered necessary in all cases to supplement the breakthrough of air defense with supporting measures to avoid the action of its forces and assets. Avoidance of the action of air defense forces and assets (the second tendency) is based chiefly on their disinformation and further development of all types of maneuver. Impressively large-scale disinformation measures are becoming a characteristic feature of aviation tactics. New tactical innovations, with the goal not of destroying or suppressing air defense forces and assets, but of concealing the composition, time, and direction of aviation assaults, are appearing more and more. The problem of disinformation is formulated quite simply: how to deceive and force the air defense system to meet aviation where in fact there is none. To resolve this problem, along with the preparation of massed assaults in the main sector, it is considered necessary to create groupings of assault and reconnaissance aircraft and drones in secondary (dummy) axes. With the start of massed assaults, actions against fighter airfields, radar posts, SAM assets are supposed to be implemented not only in the breakthrough corridors, but also over the entire line of the front and they may even be increased in intensity in the dummy axes. Such action procedures, foreign military experts believe, will force the fighter aviation to maneuver to reinforce the dummy axes and thus weaken its strength in the breakthrough sectors. There is also another aspect to this problem. One need not possess special perspicacity to see that there is nothing easier than to provoke a hasty readying of forces and assets of air defense, premature scrambling of fighters in the periods preceding the delivery of massed air assaults. Simulation of a massed scrambling of aviation from airfields, the transmission of false commanders by radio, the laying down of radar jamming... Imagine the difficulties that a commander will have in estimating the situation, if these disinforming measures are maximally plausible, if they are conducted by the attacking aviation in a coordinated manner, in accordance with a preplanned scenario. This is why western theorists believe that as a result of such measures the sense of vigilance of crews at the command and control posts will be blunted. When the fighters, scrambled due to an incorrect assessment of the situation, having expended their fuel, are coming in for a landing, they will not be able to take part in the repulse of an initiated massed raid which will be timed for this moment. And finally, this use of decoy targets will be organized in the disinformation measures on a large scale. This is assisted by the adoption into the aviation armament of qualitatively new EW assets. There are now an enormous number of decoy targets. Some of them do not have a power plant and operate for a short time, others are equipped with navigational apparatus, active jamming transmitters and automatic chaff dispensers, and may fly for some time along trajectories analogous to the routes of combat aircraft. All these decoy targets can proceed along many routes intersecting with combat aircraft and complicate the detection of rear targets by the opposing side, or be used as decoys to draw significant fighter forces. Independent actions of decoy targets at the limits of detection and intercept of fighter aviation are possible, chiefly for disinformation of command and control posts. Of course an increase in the specific weight of disinformation measures plays a negative role in complicating the situation for fighter aviation, but in opposing attacking aviation, it is also awaited by maneuvering targets. What is a modern maneuvering target and what are the capabilities for such targets to avoid the action of fighters? They are small groups or single planes, cruise missiles, drones with active jammers, operating within the framework of the general disposition and concept of the attacking aviation in a specific range of altitudes. The more the use of precision weapons becomes part of its practice, the more of these targets will be in massed raids. Where before it was necessary to expend hundreds of conventional munitions, today one or several precision missiles are enough. Therefore the crews can operate while observing the principle of "each to his own target," and widely utilize anti-fighter and anti-air defense maneuvers. Of these two basic types of maneuvers, we are interested chiefly in anti-fighter maneuver, which is done to avoid an encounter and leave the zone of possible attacks of fighters or to foil an aimed missile launch. No so long ago the main type of maneuver, known even before the Second World War, was a sharp turn toward the attacking fighters with maximum possible angular velocity. The fitting with radar sights and air-to-air guided missiles still did not lead to vital changes in the tactics of anti-fighter maneuvering in the wars in Vietnam and in the Near East. Missiles of that time had limited maneuver capabilities and short ranges and, therefore, if the attacked aircraft turned sharply, they would miss them. However later, when more sophisticated missiles entered the fighter armament, allowing them to attack air targets at various aspect angles, from long range and secretly, maneuvers to evade them were vitally complicated and pervaded with new elements. Transition to maximal flight speed, descent to minimal acceptable altitude in combination with maneuver in course and bypassing of regions protected by patrolling fighters, these and other maneuvers are programmed beforehand or may be input in the program by the crew during the flight. There are many varieties of anti-fighter maneuvers. One might say there are as many as there are situations in air-to-air combat. It is also necessary to execute anti-missile maneuvers against missiles already launched by fighters, or in expectation of their launch (uncoordinated turns with significant slip, maneuvers with sign-variable G-forces). To execute a maneuver under the new conditions, the crews use onboard equipment which warns of missile launch from fighters using both radar and IR guidance systems. These equipments are connected to jammers and IR tracers, and automatically are activated upon detection of a launch. If the missiles are "blinded," then regardless of the horizontal or vertical angle at which they are detected, the most advisable maneuver for the crews is a sharp turn at high G-forces in a direction perpendicular to their line of flight. Consequently now the crews of attacked fighters may begin the anti-fighter maneuver long before the fighters reach visual contact range, and they combine an energetic defensive turn with the use of EW assets. Here is another interesting feature. The anti-fighter maneuver is done in zones of antiaircraft missile and artillery fire of air defense assets, and cannot but be combined by the crews with anti-air defense maneuver, in order to avoid entering these zones, and in the event that they do enter them, in order to avoid being hit by missiles and projectiles. However in execution of an anti-air defense maneuver, the crews encounter a new situation. In continuous zones of missile and artillery fire, the crew's knowledge of the location of fire complexes in the terrain loses its importance, and when there are not continuous zones, highly-mobile complexes capable of delivering fire from short halts and on the move ensure the most timely information about their coordinates and evasive maneuvers planned in advance. Therefore, a more advisable form of maneuver both against missile and artillery assets and against fighters is considered above to be maneuver in altitude. The range of maneuver altitudes in the general case may vary from maximally low to maximally high, but maneuver in altitude with subsequent transition to low altitude (fig. 33), as it was until recently, no longer allows aviation to achieve surprise, since it does not emerge from the surveillance zones of the AWACS aircraft, which are capable of detecting targets against the background of the ground. Expectation of secrecy is not justified. Avoiding an encounter at low altitude with fighters, just as engagement by numerous low-altitude SAM and artillery complexes, is becoming more and more difficult. Therefore, the need arises for further reduction in altitude, which, as experience of the war in Afghanistan testifies, should not exceed 15-20 m (height of the bottom limit of the kill zone of the "Stinger" missile). But here it is hard to judge what is more dangerous for the crews flying at high speed: destruction by air defense weapons or collision with the ground. After all, with an increase in speed the minimal safe flight altitude increases, maneuverability decreases, and terrain-following becomes impossible and, indeed, the plane itself becomes a power source of thermal radiation and therefore is vulnerable to missiles with IR guidance not only from the rear, but from the front hemisphere. In addition, during flight at maximally low altitude, it is hard, or, more precisely, impossible to search for mobile camouflaged targets, to use guided bombs and other precision weapons. So how will the crews operate in such situations? They are forced to go to medium altitudes, but even such a brief maneuver leads to loss of secrecy of actions. Figure 33. Maneuver in altitude to evade air defense actions. In order to ensure clandestine flight at very low altitude, abroad they are trying to develop more sophisticated look-down radars, allowing the crews to adjust their direction of flight before reaching the objectives and to launch the missiles at them without changing altitude. However, development of such radars is still very far from perfection. It is thought more sensible to combine maneuver in altitude with radioelectronic countermeasures against the air defenses by the crews themselves using their onboard EW systems, with permission suppression of air defense installations in the flight zone. However, the difficult flight conditions at maximally low altitude provide, in the opinion of foreign military experts, an urgent need for the use of other altitudes as well. High altitudes are inconvenient for aviation; from them it is not possible to detect and deliver assaults against small and mobile targets. Nonetheless, flight at these altitudes by some crews to avoid encountering fighter aviation, the air force leaders of western countries believe to be advisable. Here, due to the significant dimensions of the "dead zones" of radars, gaps are formed in the radar field created, rendering the vectoring of fighters more difficult. In addition the density of the antiaircraft fire is decreased (fig. 33). It is clear from the figure that although the crews enter the zones of engagement of the SAM complexes at any altitude, at high altitude, where the number and dimensions of these zones are decreased, and the flight speed increases, the crews cross them more quickly and pass above the engagement zones of the low-altitude complexes. However not all foreign military specialists so categorically believe in the capabilities of the crews avoiding the action of present day air defenses. Is this not why a breakthrough of the defense, and not overcoming it, is considered decisive in the combat actions of aviation? Or is it that adequately effective variants have still not been found? Penetration to the assault objectives on the principle of "force" or evasion of air defense actions? It would seem to be a strange question. Both are necessary features of the tactics of attacking aviation. But which of these features will take the primary role in the future? Under the onslaught of what sort of adversary will the fighters find themselves? Don't wait for commentaries; there won't be any. Draw your own conclusions. You will be able to test them by looking at the further development of aviation tactics, about which we will speak. 4. A Look at the Future Military specialists abroad are striving to predict the paths of further development of tactics of aviation in combating fighter aviation. In their forecasts they allow for scientific-technical progress occurring in aviation, and various military-technical innovations which by the start of the 21st century might enter its armament. And those efforts which are undertaken in many countries of the world to develop new tactical technicals and recommendations to aircraft crews of the future become understandable. Wherein lies their fundamental novelty? All expected offensive air weapons from the standpoint of tactics may be subdivided into two large groups. One of them, aircraft, are the platforms for new types of precision, long range weapons of modular design to engage various targets without entering the zones of engagement of the ground air defense forces, and even without crossing the front lines of the opposing side at all. This group should also include reconnaissance aircraft with radiotechnical reconnaissance equipment, air elements of reconnaissance-strike complexes, and AWACS planes. They all perform support tasks, operate at a long range from and often beyond the borders of our radar field, and also may provide radioelectronic countermeasures and be protected by air defenses. The other group consists of high-speed, highly maneuverable aircraft with a low radar cross section and high thrust, having integrated EW assets and defensive weapons. This group also includes cruise missiles and drones of various types and for various purposes. They all are intended for actions over territory protected by air defenses. In developing the tactics of each of these two groups, the air force leaders of the western countries attach primary importance to the platform aircraft of the first group, which use precision weapons. They predict a great future for them. The crews of the platform aircraft are given the task of destroying the most important, well-protected objectives, and also participating in the break-through of the air defenses: assaults against SAM positions and fighter airfields in order to create a path to targets for the second group. The crews operating outside the zones of the SAM complexes and at maximum range of the fighters naturally do not require anti-air defense maneuvers. Their tactics will boil down to different types of anti-fighter maneuvers which it is envisaged they will perform in accordance with information of AWACS aircraft. However these planes, which play a very important role in controlling aviation, themselves are primary targets for the actions of fighters. Of course, they patrol in engagement zones of the SAM complexes, and are protected by fighters and equipment with EW apparatus, and can detect fighters of the opposing side long before the latter get close to them. Nonetheless the crews of these planes complain of the complexity and unreliability of coordination with protecting assets. Western specialists are concerned by the question: how to protect the large, poorly maneuverable AWACS from attacks by fighters, what tactical techniques should the crews use? Specialists name them quite definitely (fig. 34). Look at this figure. Is it not true that as you get deeper into the territory of the adversary in the search for an AWACS plane, you have something to think about? It is as simple as can be to get in trouble here. Figure 34. Tactical techniques of crews of AWACS aircraft under threat of fighter attack. The tactics of combat aircraft of the second group, which will proceed to the assault objectives over corridors cut through the air defense system by missiles of the platform aircraft of the first group, in the opinion of foreign military experts, will be based chiefly on avoiding the action of the surviving air defenses. No, of course they will not ignore the losses from the engagement by these assets, but will rely more on planes with very low radar cross sections and weak IR radiation, so-called invisible (stealth) aircraft. (Fig. 35 [not reproduced]) It is clear from the figure that these aircraft in outward appearance, despite the various purposes, have common features: they do not have large flat surfaces, breaks in their skin, or vertical control surfaces, and the B-2 bomber, made in the shape of a "flying wing," has no tail section at all. The engines and weapons are hidden in a well "slicked" fuselage, with air intakes on the top to reduce IR noticeabilty. What are these strange changes that we observe in the designs of combat aircraft? Now almost all of them, developed or planned for development in developed capitalist countries, are built with the use of technical solutions aimed at reducing their conspicuousness, and a mass adoption of "invisible" planes in the aviation armament is planned. But why are conventional planes giving way to inconspicuous ones? They are now talking of these wonderful machines in full voice, and it is easy to explain why: the possibility of covert actions of crews over the territory of the opposing side, once thought impossible, has appeared. Many military experts predict a great future for the "stealths." However the term "invisible" is just a metaphor. In fact they will not be as invisible as is thought, although they will be the sort of plane which is hard to detect. Therefore, the elation of their admirers is somewhat exaggerated. But if we are logical and consistent, then all this by no means appears depressing for the crews of these aircraft. Irony here is out of place. The new combat properties of the "invisibles" will provide scope for development also of fundamentally new tactical techniques. No longer maneuvers in course and speed, not able selection of weather conditions, and not suppression of air defenses, for many years proclaimed among the main principles of tactical techniques, but quite different components will determine the nature of actions of these aircraft. The tactics of crews of these "invisibles" will be quite diverse. They may operate independently, alone or in small groups, or in close coordination with the crews of different types of aircraft. In independent actions of "invisibles" the foundation of their tactical techniques will be the capacity of penetration to the assault objectives unnoticed by the air defense radars or IR assets. However, since it is impossible to fully eliminate the give-away signs of the aircraft, in order to remain undetected the crews must constantly maintain a specific distance from the detection means. Is it possible to achieve this in a continuous radar field of the opposing side? American military experts developing the new technologies of "invisible" aircraft answer this question in the affirmative. They assume that crews having data on the location of the most dangerous radars and possessing high professional proficiency, will be able to ensure, if not full secrecy of flight, then at least later detection by air defenses, not leaving time to the SAM complexes and fighters to engage and intercept. For a reduction in the time spent in the surveillance and engagement envelopes of the air defenses, strict limitations in the use of airborne radars and other radiating electronics, and almost complete radio silence throughout the entire combat flight, as well as the use of EW assets, are envisaged. The crews of the "invisibles" much more easily than other aircraft can camouflage their weak signs or create blips of decoy targets of low intensity on the scopes of fighters and radars of SAM complexes. As for the flight altitudes, it is advisable for them to be medium and high altitudes, more convenient for accomplishment of combat missions. In addition low-altitude flight, requiring continuous operation of terrain-following radar, especially at night and in difficult weather conditions, may strongly betray the "invisibles." In coordination with aircraft of other types, the "invisibles" may support their combat actions, first penetrating enemy territory to suppress his air defenses and search for objectives. Another version is also possible, which conventional planes with long-distance missiles will be the first to deliver an assault on air defense installations without entering their engagement zones. Then the "invisibles" (B-2 bombers) as it were in a second wave will enter the corridor formed to engage mobile missile complexes, enterprises of the military industry, and other remote objectives. But in all variants the routes of the flights, the time of approach and passage of the lines and zones of air defense will be carefully coordinated and combined with various disinformation measures. The tactics of the crews of other combat aircraft which do not have low radar cross sections to an even greater degree than for the "invisibles" will be directed toward disinformation of the entire defense system. In this they will be assisted by the onboard equipment, ensuring continuous maneuvering of the planes in automatic mode, flight along the route with hard-to-predict changes in course, and more sophisticated EW assets. In assessing the possibilities of universal highly automated EW complexes with programmed control and comparing them with the interference resistance of the command and control posts and onboard systems of the fighters, some foreign experts smile ironically: the radioelectronic situation for the opposing side will be so complex that the success of the attacking aviation is beyond doubt. But is that so? The expected complication of the situation may lead to a vital reduction in the effectiveness of combat actions of the fighter aviation, but only in the case that further development of defense ceases. However, such stagnation has never been observed in the history of the opposition of the means of defense and attack. In each previous turn of the dialectical spiral, the development of fighter tactics has followed the tactics of offensive aviation. So a one-sided prediction with the accent on the development of only one side holds the danger of great error. Let us try at least in general outline to prove the rightness of this precept and to sketch the contours of the further confrontation. This situation is greatly brightened by the development of the EW assets of the opposing side. Foreign military specialists place great hopes on the mono-pulse radar, allowing the fighter command and control centers to obtain information about the range and direction of the targets to be intercepted using only one pulse. They assume that serious difficulties will arise for the attacking aviation with expansion of the waveband of the new radars from the millimeter to the long waves, and with the development and use by the crews of technical techniques such as rapid change in the shape of pulses, retuning of the frequency from pulse to pulse. In the capacity of retaliatory measures to the strengthening of radioelectronic countermeasures of aviation, the possibility is considered of creating air defense radar systems in which the transmitting and receiving antennas are widely separated from one another. Without an idea where the receiver is located, the crews of the planes may jam only in the direction of the transmitter, while the receiver will be unaffected by jamming. But an ever more insidious threat to aviation is created by a wide network of passive assets for the detection and tracking of air targets, which it will be impossible not only to suppress, but even to detect. And what about weapons systems on the fighters with combined guidance (radar, infrared, electro-optic, laser)? After all, all of these systems must be suppressed simultaneously and immediately! It turns out that the outcome of the confrontation becomes quite problematic, just like the paths of development of the very tactics of offensive aviation. However, aviation will have yet another "trump card" -- the cruise missiles of tomorrow, precision, long and medium range, with different warheads (dispenser, armor-piercing, concrete-piercing). Although according to the treaty between the USSR and the U.S., ground-based cruise missiles have been eliminated, air- and sea-launched cruise missiles remain, and this certainly does not make things easier for fighters. Pilots will be in a difficult situation when intercepting cruise missiles launched many hundreds of kilometers away from the protected installations, missiles moving at high, supersonic speed, maneuvering in accordance with a program for searching for the given targets and evading the attacks of fighters. How can such missiles be attacked, which automatically select the optimal flight trajectory, go around obstacles in their path to the target, and even have reduced levels of give-away signs? At the same time, judging from the development of cruise missiles being conducted abroad, the effectiveness of their assaults will become so great that any assumption of intercept is obviously unacceptable. Plans are to mount infrared and optical instruments, connected to a system for matching the contrast contours of observed objects and those entered in memory. Systems are being developed for autonomous (from on board the missile) evaluations of the degree of destruction of the objects, retargeting the missiles at surviving elements and delivering munitions to the targets at an aspect angle most effective for their destruction. (FLIGHT, 1988, No. 4132.) Of course, a few paragraphs about the cruise missiles of the future is only a concentrate of information, and indeed not a complete one. For the time being, arguments about new approaches to the tactics of fighters in combatting cruise missiles remain just as incomplete. In order that I not repeat myself, I recommend that the reader turn to chapter II and look again at the capabilities of future fighters. So how does the onslaught of the air adversary, armed with super-modern equipment, appear? How does he intend to use all these military technical novelties in the fight with fighter aviation, considering that the latter, too, continues to be improved? There is a constant discussion of opinions, ideas, views regarding questions of further confrontation of offensive and fighter aviation. Much is still unclear. Will not fighter aviation be confronted by other conditions of combat action, today unknown, by the start of the coming era? This is the key question of the problem. It is answered in different ways, and this is a true sign that the problem is still not resolved. But here we enter the shaky ground of suppositions, and will not be hasty in our forecasts. Clearly, even if resolved in the technical context, a problem will still long await its technical solutions. * * * The process of confrontation of tactics of the opposing sides, occurring in close relation and mutual causation, is a natural and continuous one. Here any of the directions of such confrontation begins with the appearance or advent of offensive weapons. Naturally the creation of defensive assets without some information about the offensive weapons is practically impossible. The advent of more powerful aviation not only makes conditions difficult for fighter aviation, but also reveals to it new ways to resolve problems, provokes the need to seek out and develop more effective equipment and tactics, and the development of fighter aviation and air defense as a whole engenders new techniques and tactics of aviation. And this bilateral process will not end as long as aviation and air defenses exist. Chapter IV. Mysteries of Interaction with Ground Air Defenses From the start of its creation, air defense was structured and developed as an integrated system, including different types of forces and assets capable through their joint efforts of repelling enemy air raids. And from the very start this system included fighter aviation, which conducted the battle with the air adversary in close interaction with the ground air defense assets. And now I should reveal a secret. It should be acknowledged that this interaction is not all that close. It holds many mysteries, contradictions, and prejudices which are not easy to figure out. But are things as bad as all that? Before we delve into the causes of this, unfortunately we must make another excursion into history. "Unfortunately" because this question is by no means raised for the first time. 1. Who Gets Priority? At the air defense command post, the combat alert signal was sounded. A large group of bombers was approaching the protected installation. First the fighters were inserted into the battle to repel the raid. They bravely attacked the enemy. But the AA gunners were awaiting a favorable moment to open fire, and watched the air battle carefully -- they did not want to hit their own pilots! But then the AA artillery opened fire. Now the fighters kept away from the fire bursts, and the bombers meanwhile had already entered their target run... Such a picture was a not uncommon sight at the start of the Great Patriotic War. At that time the air defense had determined two active assets, the fighter aviation and the antiaircraft artillery. Their combat actions were supported by air observation posts, which detected the adversary visually and from the sound of his motors using optical and acoustic instruments (binoculars, range finders, and sound rangers). The fighters were supposed to join battle first, and after them the antiaircraft guns of various calibers, and machineguns located close to and within the objective, would open fire. And the service for warning of the air adversary? How did it warn the fighter aviation and AA artillery? The short range of visual and optical detection of targets reduced to naught the aspiration of the fighters to intercept the adversary at remote approaches to the protected facilities. The fundamental defects in the acoustic instruments, which also had short range of operation and accuracy in determining the target coordinates, also had their effect. Too little time remained for their interception after the noise of the motors had reached the sound rangers. Under conditions of poor visibility, binoculars and optical range finders were of little use. The literature of the fatherland reported, not without pride: first experimental units for radio detection of planes was developed in our country in 1934. (See: M.M. Lobanov. Razvitiye sovetskoy radiolokatsionnoy tekhniki. (Development of Soviet Radar Technology). M.: Voyenizdat, 1982, p. 21.) And what of it? A whole seven years later, radars, and only six experimental models, type RUS-2, existed only in the national air defense forces (See: Voyska protivovoxdusnoy oborony strany v Velikoy Otechestvennoy voyne. (National Air Defense Forces in the Great Patriotic War), vol. 1, M.: voyenizdat, 1954, p. 67.) How can we not recall here that our future ally England back in 1940 was able to create a coherent air defense warning system (based on 38 radars) and, fighting one-on-one with the German Luftwaffe, won the battle. (Ibid, p. 42). The war immediately demonstrated the increased role of air defense and the improvement of interaction with its forces and assets. Although overall they constitute an impressive force, a classical scheme, developed before the start of the war and envisaging a consistent and organized commitment of air defense assets to battle was not developed. Of course the conditions of the war's inception most unfavorably affected the organization and implementation of interaction. These have already been mentioned in preceding chapters, but there were also other causes here. Air defense forces interacting with fighter aviation were not fully equipped with artillery guns, did not have sufficient ammunition, and measures to form, arm, and deploy the subunits and units of AA artillery were not concluded. The forces and assets of national air defense, few in number, without a unified command, were grouped to defend individual major points in the threatened regions. Such a defense was very much a point-of-resistance defense, did not have adequate depth and was not able to repel massed strikes of bombers, which in addition were accompanied by active suppression of air defenses. Under such conditions, how could the coordination of fighter aviation and antiaircraft artillery be organized? By day the initiative in selection of targets was usually left to the fighters. They attacked the adversary at high altitude, where the AA fire was less effective, and also at other altitudes. The AA gunners followed the progress of the battle, and when the pilots entered their fire zones, they conducted "blank fire," i.e., they tracked the targets, observing them through their sights. Sometimes the gunners themselves helped the fighters with target designation by laying down check points with special rounds, which created a cloud of colored smoke. Fire was commenced only after the pilots exited the battle. At night the fighters repelled the raids of bombers in zones which were organized in illuminated searchlight fields, or conducted visual search for aircraft against the background of the moon, the bright side of the horizon, or from the flame from the exhaust pipes of the motors. During enemy attacks in engagement zones of the AA artillery, the pilots issued agreed signals "I am attacking" with colored flares, but these signals were hard to make out from the ground, greatly tied down the gunners, and often led to the engagement of friendly planes or to the AA artillery generally ceasing to fire. The AA artillery could deliver fire only on targets illuminated by the searchlights, or ineffective barrage fire. However the searchlights, having a short range of illumination of targets (7-8 km) and obtaining very imprecise data from sound rangers, also proved to be far from the best means. They groped long and impotently in the sky in search of enemy planes, and could support the actions of the fighter aviation and AA artillery only in cloudless weather, and only in a small region. All these mix-ups and contradictions clearly did not fit any frameworks of the theory of interaction developed on the eve of the war. In order to find a way out of the critical situation, in which the coordinating forces and assets found themselves, required exceptional efforts of the military leadership, industry, and all personnel, but first of all a sharp increase in the combat capabilities of AA artillery. Soon the situation began to markedly change for the better. In the troop air defense forces they began to form strong AA artillery groups. By the end of 1942 they were already able to support the massing of forces and assets of AA artillery and to create zones of dense, multi-layered fire over the main troop groupings. Thanks to the creation of large artillery groupings, the troops received a reliable "umbrella" over their heads, and losses to fascist aviation grew sharply. In the first year of the war, AA artillery destroyed an average of about 300 enemy planes a month, and in the second half of 1942, more than 400. (Central Archive of the Ministry of Defense (TsAMO) F. 36, op. 12552, d. 10, l. 67-69.) Subsequently the AA defense became more and more powerful. To protect the troops operating in main axes, they were reinforced with a larger and larger quantity of AA artillery units and formations. For example, in the Yassko-Kisinev operation, the 6th Tank Army alone had an AA artillery group consisting of an AA artillery division and three separate AA artillery regiments. (See: Voyenno-istoricheskiy zhurnal, 1962, No. 1) With the increased capabilities of the AA weapons, the fighters began to interact with them by separating the regions of the battle, i.e., by intercepting the adversary at the approaches to the protected troops, coordinating its actions with the AA gunners, and they with their fire separated the enemy fighters from our planes at critical moments of the air-to-air battle. For coordination of joint actions sorties of fighters were reported to the CPs of the AA units, and air representatives were sent to them. In the national air defense forces, they also conducted serious organizational transformations. These boiled down to a quantitative strengthening of forces and assets, creation of extensive air defense zones, the forward lines of which were 200-250 km from the main protected installations. The zone of action of the air defense covered the airspace over the defended installations and at the near approaches to them. The fighter aviation as the most long-range weapon was committed to the battle at the far approaches and concentrated its efforts in the most dangerous axes, but if necessary operated in the zone of the AA artillery. But the main thing was that the fighter aviation began to be successfully used in the interest of protecting not one but several installations. Large groups and assets of air defense were concentrated to defend the most important rear installations. Thus in the defense of Moscow alone, just from the 1st Air Defense Corps and the 6th Fighter Aviation Corps operationally subordinate to it, 600-700 fighters, 600-800 medium AA guns and 170-350 low-caliber guns, 170-650 high caliber AA machineguns, and 700-760 AA searchlights participated in the repulse of massed strikes of fascist aviation. (TsAMO, f. 72, op. 12274, d. 59, l. 1; d.7, l. 18; d. 49, l. 45.) A great leap in the development of air defense was the adoption of radars which were produced by industry in a mobile ("Redut") and fixed ("Pegmatit") variant, the number of which by the end of 1943 had reached 200. (Ibid, f. 81, op. 12204, d. 453, l. 4) While before the air defense could detect and destroy only visible planes, and behind clouds they were betrayed by the sound of their motors, now neither clouds nor darkness hampered the battle with them. Despite the technical imperfection, even the first models of radars make it possible at once to improve by a factor of 8-10 the range of detection of the planes, determine their coordinates almost instantaneously, and know the air situation over quite wide regions. Based on radars, dense radar fields and fighter guidance centers were organized. The incidence of radar guidance increased in 1942 from 17 to 46 percent. (Ibid, op. 94592, d. 29, l. 55.) Now fighter aviation repulsed air raids jointly with other ground assets of air defense, which had also experienced a qualitative leap: anti-aircraft artillery, which had radar gunsights, and radar searchlights (visual searchlights combined with radar) which illuminated the aircraft suddenly without a preliminary search -- "with the shot." The conditions of interaction of fighter aviation and antiaircraft artillery also improved. This was implemented in two ways: by distribution of efforts over zones of combat action and by joint destruction of enemy planes in the zones of AA fire. Here preference was given to the former, simpler, method, when fighter aviation and AA artillery operated without hampering one another. But during interaction in a single zone, priority continued to be given to the fighters. By the end of the war Soviet air defense, extending for many hundreds of kilometers, and saturated with a net of airfields, observation and guidance posts, and AA positions, became more powerful and more impenetrable for the enemy. Its manpower and assets were echeloned to an ever-increasing depth from the defended objects, and further concentration of AA artillery in the most important of them continued. Fighter aviation, interacting with AA artillery in zones of combat action, successfully protected objects in the territory liberated from the enemy. Thanks to its maneuverability and offensive nature of actions, it remains the basis strike force for air defense throughout the war in interaction with AA artillery. However, interaction at night still left something to be desired. The Germans were using night fighters as much as they could -- the two-engine Me-110 planes with onboard radars and strengthened cannon (in the Berlin AD system alone the number had reached three squadrons by 1944). (F. Reuter. Funkmess Opladen, 1971, p. 122.) -- and our fighters interacted with AA artillery only in visual searchlight fields, or looked for the enemy from the flames of his exhaust pipes. Now, jumping ahead mentally some one-and-a-half decades, let's look again at the AD command post. 2. Gains and Losses ...Slowly the mighty radars move their latticed, delicate antennas, searching the air space. The silver arrows of the SAMs are frozen in readiness to launch, the all-weather fighters on the gray concrete are ready to scramble. The Great Patriotic War never knew such weapons of the national air defense forces. In the ground forces, the rifled ZZ artillery has gradually given way to the SAMs. Possessing different capabilities than AA artillery in terms of range and accuracy in striking targets over a broad range of altitudes and flight speeds, they could destroy the air adversary not only over protected forces, but also at the far approaches to them. A ramified net of mobile radars provided continuous tracking of the air situation over broad territories. The systems of troop and national air defense forces were created as a unified whole on the basis of mixed elements of SAM and AA artillery units and subunits, which are deployed ahead of time to protect objects, have a stable character, and elements of fighter aviation. As the most maneuverable AD resource, it was not assigned to individual objects, but was supposed to act at the boundaries of the whole defended region and mass efforts in decisive axes. All this rich arsenal of new AD weapons and their principles of formation, in combination with guidance systems which ensured coordination of efforts of interacting forces, their warning and target designation, radically strengthened the might of defense, and created the capability of protecting whole regions and axes. The interacting manpower and resources of air defense also became capable of tasks which earlier could not be dreamed of. But then, let us not create illusions. It would seem from common sense that the effectiveness of joint actions of fighters and SAM weapons should increase at least in proportion to their combat might. However this did not occur. This supposition, at first glance indisputable, is erroneous. This phenomenon became a riddle, but where was the explanation? Here one other problem was also noted: securing the safety of the fighters, and eliminating cases when they were engaged by SAMs, proved to be a very complex task, and this led to very fateful consequences. With entry of the fighters into the kill zones of the SAM complexes, their freedom of action was constrained, and great limitations were imposed on fire maneuver of the SAM complexes, so that the overall result was less than the sum of the results achieved by each system separately. A strange situation arose: the gains in combat might of air defense turned out to be losses. And then one "side of the scale of interaction" -- the growth of combat capabilities of AD weapons, overflowed, and the counterweight proved to be entirely inadequate: joint actions interfered with utilizing them fully. And indeed, let us compare: high-altitude, rapid-fire, jamming-resistent SAM complexes, and supersonic all-weather fighters with powerful weapons, limiting the capabilities of one another... Years went by, and the range of fire of the SAM complexes grew, and the forward edge of the zone of combat actions of SAM assets extended further and further from the defended objects, crowding out the fighters. However much in the organization of interaction remained as before. The fighter aviation was assigned the battle with aviation at the far perimeters, beyond the limits of the kill zones of the SAM complexes, and the SAM complexes had the job at the close approaches and directly over the objects. Each AD asset independently operated in its own zone, not interfering with the other, or ... the attacking aviation, from consistently overcoming first the resistance of the fighter aviation, and then that of the SAM assets. Thus after giving an initial impetus to joint actions, this impetus ceased to function. In AD systems a significant gap appeared in place and time of the fire influence on the adversary. What is more, this gab, or "neutral zone," kept expanding. But enough of abstraction and speculative estimates. Let us pose the question specifically: what are the dimensions of this "neutral zone"? In order to eliminate engagement of friendly fighters by SAM complexes, they must be pulled from the battle at a distance from the forward edge of the kill zone of the SAM complexes equal to Sv = Ri + Vi (tk + tz), where: Ri is the turning radius of the fighters when they pull out of the battle; Vi is the fight speed of the fighters; tk is the time of issuance and travel of the order to pull out of the battle; tz is the delay time of the pilots in executing the order. Simple calculation allows the reader to obtain the specific dimensions of the air space where the adversary is not influenced, but even without doing the calculation, just by glancing at the formula it is obvious that all of its components depend on the flight speed of the fighters, and this, alas, does not have a tendency to decrease. At the same time, this seemingly simple formula of interaction is very complex from the standpoint of its tactical realization. First of all, the SAM element includes complexes for various purposes with different ranges of fire, which in turn are determined by the altitude of the targets. Second, in order to destroy targets within the limits of the whole depth of the kill zone of the SAM complex, the distribution of targets and the issuance of target designations to the SAM crews must be done at the more remote perimeters, whose location will also depend on the flight speed of the targets. And third, the spatial dimensions both of the SAM kill zones and of the air-to-air battles of the fighters have continued to increase, especially if they are moved to the forward hemisphere of the targets. But for actions in a single zone (the zone of SAM fired) the danger of an erroneous engagement of friendly fighters has continued. The further refitting of AD systems with more sophisticated SAM complexes, the tightening of their network, and the growth of fire power have made the presence of fighters in their zones more and more hazardous, and then the command was faced with a dilemma: SAM complexes or fighters? And indeed, identifying aircraft in the air at long range, quickly and correctly determining who is friend, who foe, under conditions which rule out a visual assessment of the external distinguishing marks, has become very difficult for the crews of SAM complexes. And their elements have increasingly expanded and deployed in such a way that continuous zones of missile fire were formed over large territories. Therefore, for fighter aviation there simply remained no free air space which could not come under the fire of SAM complexes. Experience of local wars showed that if the fighters were forced to operate in the same zone with them, then SAM fire would shoot down friendly aircraft, as happened in the Arab-Israeli War of 1973. (International Defense Review, 1974, No. 3.) Where, there, were the fighters to operate, if their safety in the zones of SAM fire was not guaranteed? Only at the far approaches to the defended objects, or in the rear, which from the tactical standpoint was not very advantageous? And how to intercept low-flying targets if the lines of commitment of the fighters to battle could not be extended beyond the limits of the SAM kill zones? Puzzles, puzzles... But after all, it had long been known that a chain cannot be stronger than its weakest link, and fighter aviation became this link. The gain of SAM assets led to a loss in its combat capabilities. It cannot be said that this situation, which had acquired for the fighters an increasingly negative coloration, was all that unexpected. It had developed gradually, and the ground AD assets did not become so diverse overnight, from the mighty multi-channel complexes, which could engage several targets simultaneously, to the single missile on a soldier's shoulder, with no warning of the approach of an air adversary. But equally gradually the role and place of fighter aviation in the AD systems changed, as we shall see. 3. The Role and Place of Fighter Aviation in AD Systems The role and place of fighter aviation in AD systems, western theorists believe, are determined by the specific features of the military-geographic situation, the political and economic importance of the specific regions and objectives, the combat properties and capabilities of the fighters and other manpower and resources making up the air defense. Economic factors and the level of development of each country have a significant influence on the role and place of fighter aviation. In studying this question, western theorists concluded that the changes in these factors, especially the combat capabilities of the fighters and SAM complexes, which developed at far from the same rates, from time to time provoke an overestimate of their role and place in AD systems. From the history of development of air defense it is clear that the amplitude of such changes has proven quite wide, from acknowledgement of fighter aviation as the chief means of air defense to its complete negation. During the Second World War and in subsequent wars until the advent of SAM complexes, fighters played a decisive role and comprised the foundation of air defense of many countries. AA artillery was in second place, although its effectiveness was improving constantly. Thus while in the First World War AA artillery of all warring countries accounted for about 15 to 20 percent of downed aircraft, in the Second World War it was already 40 percent. (ANTIAIRCRAFT JOURNAL, 1949, No. 11) The SAM weapons which were supplanting the AA artillery first were used only to reinforce the fighter aviation. Then their role quickly grew. Thus in the local wars in Vietnam and in the Near East they destroyed (along with AA artillery) around 90 percent of all downed air targets. (INTERNATIONAL DEFENSE REVIEW, 1973, No 12). Such high effectiveness of actions of the SAM complexes led to a reassessment of the role and place of fighter aviation in air defense systems. In the West new theories of organization of air defense began to appear, in which fighters were assigned a more than modest place. It was proposed that they be used only for protecting secondary regions unprotected by SAM complexes. Thus the French Army General A. Bofre stated: "Be that as it may, now it is clear that aviation can no longer play a decisive role in air defense of objects, when the latter are provided with strong missile protection." (FORCE ARMEE FRANCAISE, 1964, No. 18) Many agreed with him, believing that SAM complexes were capable of solving practically all problems of air defense, and that they should assume a monopoly status in it. However, the opinions of other military theorists were not so categorical, and "anti-fighter" views and theories did not live long. Subsequently they were revised in the direction of a balanced development of SAM complexes and fighters, but still the role of aviation had diminished to some extent. In particular, as the foreign press reported, the number of fighters in the U.S. air defense system by the start of the seventies had decreased by nearly two thirds in comparison with 1965. In the FRG, of four fighter squadrons only two remained. Only the English command had stuck to its former views, asserting that the air defense of Great Britain was based on the use of fighter interceptors as long as the opposing side had strike aircraft in its armament. (AIR FORCES, 1972, No. 11.) The experience of local wars refuted the pessimism of the extinction of fighter aviation. It was found that SAM complexes and fighters had their own specific fields of application, where they could be used with the greatest success and, therefore, that they did not exclude but complemented one another. In the early 70s in the NATO countries the concept was adopted for their joint use. Here the priority use of fighter aviation was envisaged beyond the zones of SAM fire, and at ranges far from the defended objects. Even today military leaders in different countries do not agree in their assessment of the role and place of fighter aviation in the air defense system. At times the differences and polarity have been great. At one pole are the adherents of SAM weapons. Comparing the characteristics of fighters and SAMs, they argue that the time spent on closing with targets flying at supersonic speed for fighters even with the highest readiness to scramble (30 seconds) is almost twice as long as for SAMs. Therefore in order to achieve the same effectiveness of combat actions of fighter aviation, a significantly longer range of target detection is required than for SAM complexes. Noting the high accuracy, rate of fire, and operational reliability of SAM complexes, some foreign theorists believe that the dominant role in combatting the aerial adversary has forever shifted from the fighters to SAM systems. The views of these theorists have found support in some countries, where SAM complexes now occupy the leading role. At the other pole are the proponents of fighter aviation, who propose that although SAM weapons do have a higher level of combat readiness and other advantages, they are not capable of fighting a large number of enemy planes, operating in high densities, without fighters. Besides, SAM complexes have limitations in range of fire, and their missiles with respect to G forces. They are still not effective enough in combatting energetically maneuvering planes. Therefore the probability of a kill against such targets in comparison with maneuvering ones diminishes markedly, and generally is below the rated probability. In their opinion fighter aviation is more mobile and to a significant extent is free of these defects. The tactics of fighters are more flexible and allow their action in any region over a broad range of altitudes, in a rapidly changing air situation and enemy tactics. In this sense the elements of SAM air defense complexes are in the worse position. They have less mobility and cannot quickly elude a strike, since tearing down their battle formations, relocating to a new region, and subsequent setup require a significant amount of time, which sometimes exceeds the total duration of the enemy raid. Proponents of fighter aviation believe that in contrast to SAM complexes it possesses adequate capabilities for maneuver of long range. Only through the use of fighters is it possible to quickly concentrate efforts of air defense in the axis of the main enemy strike, ensure protection of the flanks of friendly forces, and to close a breech formed in the air defense system for some time. Among the advantages which fighters have over SAMs they cite the capability of the fighters to monitor greater volumes of air space, and more reliably determine the national affiliation of the targets. Therefore to assert that SAM weapons are the high road of development of air defense is at the least still premature. Foreign specialists stress that our desires to the contrary, the initiative in selection of time and place of strikes belongs to the adversary. He will penetrate the AD system where it is advantageous to him, i.e., in the axes which are most weakly protected by SAMs, at narrow sectors of the front. But this means that the air defence manpower and assets will be forced to operate under conditions of a very uncertain situation, that only that portion of the SAM complexes will participate in the repulse of the raids who are in the breakthrough zone. In this situation, only fighter aviation can execute a fast maneuver, concentrating its forces in the threat axis, and thus compensate for errors in predicting the possible actions of the adversary. The controversy between adversaries and proponents of fighter aviation is still not over. Western specialists are not all that confident in placing an equal sign between fighters and SAM complexes. They vacillate on who should be given the preference under various conditions of the situation. However the controversy in no case is about a monopoly, mutually exclusive use of SAMs or fighters. In their studies and recommendations, foreign theorists are unanimous in asserting that air defense must be organized as a unified system containing both SAM complexes and fighters. As was already mentioned above, depending on the geographic situation and other factors, these questions may be resolved in different ways. Thus the U.S. and Canada have made fighter-interceptors the foundation of their air defenses. They have been assigned to protect the most important administrative-political centers, command and control organs, air and sea lines of communication against air strikes. But in the European countries of NATO these tasks as a rule are distributed between air defense aviation and SAM units. At present all NATO countries are paying close attention to raising the combat capabilities both of SAM complexes and of fighters, a factor which among others determines their role and place in air defense systems. One could spend some time enumerating the new modes of aviation and missile equipment. Let us stipulate at the outset that we shall not try to "break them down to the fine details," for they are too diverse. Besides, many of them are very short-lived, and merge with others, change their direction, and indeed this book is not a reference. Therefore it is best for the reader to acquaint himself with specific characteristics of the SAM complexes and fighters under development from other sources. We shall limit ourselves only to a description of the general trends of their development, and assess how they influence the role and place of fighter aviation. In the opinion of foreign military specialists, among the basic trends of development of SAM missile weapons one can note an increase in their fire power and accuracy, an increase in the range of the SAM, and a reduction in the time required to commence fire. Linked to systems of long-range radar detection, these complexes will have high-speed missiles with better maneuverability and combined guidance systems. Such SAM complexes are augmented by close-in systems with television, IR and laser sights. At the same time, the capabilities both of mobile all-weather SAM missile and artillery complexes to engage high-speed aircraft and missiles, and in fire maneuver without change of fire positions, are also increasing. Deployed in troop battle formations and possessing high fire productivity, they are used in various combinations; the missiles and guns may also be deployed on the same transport. (INTERAVIA, 1985, No. 11; 1986, No. 12) How do things stand with regard to an increase in combat capabilities of fighter aviation? The foreign press notes that it is occurring chiefly through replacement of outmoded aircraft with more sophisticated ones, and also through stage-by-stage modernization of the fighters now in the air defense armament. There is no need to turn to the characteristics of the prospective craft, with which the reader was acquainted in chapter II; one need only supplement them with the requirements imposed on "pure" air defense fighters: assurance of intercept of attacking aviation at more remote perimeters, increase in the capabilities of detection of small targets (cruise missiles), and also rapid scramble on alert. Undoubtedly, with a sharp increase in the capabilities of fighter aviation, its place and role in organization of air defense will also increase. This becomes all the more evident in light of the statements of some western experts, who try to look into the future of defense. They assume that the latest models of modern AD complexes will probably remain effective for some time, but by the end of the century they will not be able to repulse air raids with an increase in their density, or destruction of high-speed missiles maneuvering with high G forces. Despite the further improvement in characteristics, the range of complexes will still prove to be inadequate to protect objects at remote approaches, and they themselves will remain vulnerable to precision weapons. (INTERAVIA. 1984, No. 2; AVIATION WEEK 1986, No. 7) This is why in the development and improvement of AD systems, one starts with the fact that no type of weapon created to this point can ensure reliable protection of friendly objects from all the offensive air weapons at the enemy's disposal. To accomplish this task it is necessary to have a precisely organized interaction of different types of weapons within the framework of a uniform air defense system. At the same time, joint actions of fighters and SAM complexes continue to impose some restrictions on the combat capabilities of each of them, especially when the state affiliation of the targets is determined not on the approach to the intercept lines, but on the ground from their fragments. Therefore the contradiction between the growing might of air defense weapons and their capability of joint actions continues to develop, and the problem will not find its solution. Of course it would be illogical to abandon interaction in one zone, say foreign military specialists. But how are we to combine the efforts of fighters and antiaircraft weapons, how can we eliminate their mutual limitations? To resolve this problem newer and newer attempts are made, and technical and organizational measures are undertaken. In particular, work is done to improve systems of airspace monitoring in order to ensure a more detailed depiction of the situation at command posts, new methods are being developed for optimal distribution of forces against targets, for each weapon altitudes and times are established when it can be used without limitation, but the problem remains unresolved. Meanwhile foreign experts note that the processes of the battle by fighters and SAM complexes with the air adversary are becoming more and more similar. Thus the targets are detected by radars of the guidance centers of the fighter aviation, and by the reconnaissance and target designation radars of SAM complexes at long range, and identified with "IFF" devices. Then a target designation is issued to the fighters and to the missile guidance centers, the targets are automatically traced by the pilots or by the SAM crews, and after entry into the kill zone of the air-to-air or surface-to-air missiles, are destroyed. The only difference is that the fighters close quickly with the adversary and must obtain a target designation from the ground or airborne command post, while the SAM complexes stay in the same place and have their own target designation assets. Consequently there is some unity developing in the battles fought by fighters and by SAM subunits, and as a consequence wider capabilities have developed for organization of their joint actions. Thus the tactics of fighter aviation in air defense systems continue to be the tactics of a joint battle waged in accordance with a uniform concept, in which two sub-systems must complement one another. Here is something to think about both for the fighters and for the SAM crews. Interaction between them should keep pace with the development of aviation and missile equipment, allow for changes in enemy tactics, and undoubtedly assure complete realization of their combat capabilities. Today the variants of joint battle are diverse. The fighters may conduct an independent search in earlier-assigned regions and meet the adversary before his approach to the SAM kill zones. It is necessary to reduce the density of the raid and scatter the battle formations of large groups, and then it will be easier for the SAM crews to complete their destruction. If necessary the pilots can enter the SAM zones, distribute their efforts against the targets, altitudes, axes, and, if individual SAMs should be put out of action, also in terms of time of actions. Of course here it is necessary to adhere to minimally permissible ranges of closure with the adversary, and observe the restrictions in maneuver in order to assure safety against engagement by friendly missiles. Nonetheless, if one looks closely into such diverse variants of joint battle, one can see their surprising uniformity. They all flow from the role and place of fighter aviation, and are based on close interaction with SAM weapons and in this regard they are alike as two peas in a pod. The only difference lies in the conditions of battle and the tactical techniques. Only by rising to the height of this concept of joint battle can one see beyond today. Thus as the most maneuverable and long-range AD asset, fighter aviation plays a decisive role in crushing the air adversary at the far approaches to the defended territory, and where the SAM complexes are less effective. Its place is in regions which are beyond the reach of SAM missiles (to the front, rear, on the flanks, and in gaps between kill zones), and if necessary (with high density of the enemy raid, or enemy strikes on the SAM complexes) even in these zones. The importance and the irreplaceability of fighter aviation in air defense systems are determined by its high capabilities to combat planes carrying precision weapons, its capacity to fight independent combat actions with limited information about the air situation, to execute rapid maneuver from one axis to another, if events develop in such a way that the disposition of air defense manpower and assets no longer adequately correspond to it. And finally, air defense fighter aviation shares its role and place with front-line fighters protecting the troops. After all, the air adversary will break through the regions of their combat actions to get to objectives in national rear. Therefore, the protection of troops and objects of the rear, as it were, merges into a single chain, although at first glance it appears that their links perform different missions. In fact only the conditions of combat action, and the place of the fighters in this chain, are different. Here too there are specific problems and variants. Sometimes fighters protecting the troops are the first to join battle and thus create favorable conditions for air defense fighters who are committed to battle at subsequent perimeters. At other times all the fighters operate in the same region and distribute their efforts by axes. Everything depends on the character of the enemy raid, the disposition of the protected objects and air bases, and the level of combat readiness of the fighters by the start of the raid. 4. The Tendency of Development of Air Defense and the Tactics of Fighter Aviation Now and in the foreseeable future, foreign military specialists believe, the basic problems of air defense will be: repulse of massed raids of aviation and other offensive air weapons operating in an enormous space and using powerful fire and electronic countermeasures; intercept of high-speed, low-visibility planes, cruise missiles, and drones at very low and very high altitude; combat with planes carrying new-generation precision weapons and destruction of missiles themselves while in trajectory; the high cost of air defense systems. Of course these problems did not arise yesterday, and they have received close attention before, but at the present stage of development of air defense they must be resolved again, with allowance for the principle of defensive sufficiency. Such a precept did not exist in the past, but today it is the focus. It is necessary to stop the arms race and achieve a further increase in the strength of air defense through higher quality indices, on the basis of reasonable spending for defense. And do this given the mighty groups of offensive air weapons of the probable adversary, and the unceasing growth of their combat potential. But if the threat of attack continues, then a limited quantity of manpower and assets of air defense for reliable protection of troops and objects from surprise massed attacks from the air can be compensated for only through the development of favorable conditions for their timely and even prior commitment to battle, rational target distribution, and prevention of heavy losses on ground and in the air. These are quality indices, which determine the tendencies of development of air defense. As we see, the competition between the means of defense and offense acquire new traits proceeding from reasonable sufficiency. There are a great many tendencies of development of air defense. We shall dwell only on the following, which exert a vital influence on the tactics of fighter aviation: the further increase in combat readiness of air defense; the aspiration to increase the range of detection and engagement of the air adversary; further centralization and automation of command and control, and enhancement of the survivability of air defense. The further improvement in combat readiness of air defense acquires especially great importance given the defensive nature of military doctrine. This arises from the need to join battle with an air adversary at any minute, from the constant reduction of the already strict time limit which air defense has for preparation and repulse of massed raids. Vigilance is also a weapon. Having an adequate amount of even the most sophisticated combat equipment and trained personnel, the air defense forces will simply not have the time to exert the necessary countermeasures on the adversary, and will be caught unawares if the time required to make them ready remains as it is. An increase in combat readiness consists in an increase in the strength of the alert forces, an increase in the mobility of SAM weapons in order to concentrate them in threat axes, but it acquires special importance for fighter aviation, which in comparison with SAM complexes takes significantly more time to destroy targets. In order to not find itself in a secondary role in the repulse of massed raids by an air adversary, its combat readiness must be significantly raised. This finds reflection in intensive hunts for ways to reduce the time required for takeoff and rapid massed commitment of fighters to battle, and also in fitting them with weapons which make it possible to fight brief but successful battles at maximum effort. In the intercept of a large number of targets simultaneously with airborne weapons sights, and their engagement in a single attack, the total time spent by the fighters in the air is also reduced, and they can prepare more quickly for more sorties. In addition, the manpower and assets of air defense may be made combat-ready in a timely manner, and fighter aviation scrambled ahead of time if the air adversary is detected earlier than he is now. Inadequate range of detection has a negative affect on the level of combat readiness, and demands that a greater strength of alert assets be held ready for repulse of a surprise enemy attack. The aspiration to increase the range of detection and engagement of the air adversary has always been one of the main tendencies of development of PVO systems. This tendency appeared with the growth in speed in the 60s and at the start of the 80s when precision air-to-ground missiles, launched from long range, and planes with small radar cross sections and weak IR radiation began to enter the air armament. For successful functioning of air defense systems, the most radical solution of the problem would be extension of the range of detection to maximum values, i.e., to the home airfields of aviation, which would make it possible to detect its takeoff to deliver massed strikes. This idea was met with enthusiasm by military specialists abroad, who tried to implement it by creation and integrated use of ground and air assets, based both on traditional and on new principles of detection of air targets. This tendency is manifested most strongly in the U.S., where they are constantly improving the existing system of radar early-warning aircraft (AWACS system) and developing fundamentally new means of reconnaissance -- over-the-horizon radars and space-based stations. How is this tendency in action? The basis of the program for improving the radar early warning aircraft includes a modification of E-3A aircraft, an increase in the range of action of aircraft radars within the limits of direct visibility, and also modernization of the data processing apparatus for display and tracking of a large number of targets from this range. At the same time active development is under way for new radar early warning complexes based on dirigibles, captive balloons, helicopters and radars operating in the decimeter range, to detection of "stealth" aircraft, cruise missiles and other small targets which are unprotected in this range by anti-radar coatings. Variants in the use of radar early warning systems are also being improved. Organization of early-warning zones, a build-up of the ground radar field and enhancement of its stability in threat axes, the use of fighter guidance centers to raise the through-put of the system as a whole -- all these variants increase the range both of detection and of engagement of the air adversary. (MILITARY TECHNOLOGY, 1986, No. 5; Defense ELECTRONICS, 1987, No. 7) Over-the-horizon radars constitute a fundamentally new means of increasing the range of detection of the air adversary. Recall that the basis of the operation of these stations is the skip affect of short radio waves from the ionosphere and the surface of the earth, and also air targets and accompanying perturbations located in the path of their propagation. The capacity of over-the-horizon radars to detect these targets beyond the line of sight, and the enormous dimensions of the air space, several tens of times more than the zone of surveillance of conventional radars, have long attracted the attention of military scientists. The capabilities of over-the-horizon radars are great. They are capable of detecting any air targets over all altitudes in a range from 900-3,000 km and more, and need not fear anti-radar missiles. Although the linear dimensions of the antenna systems of these stations reach several kilometers (fig. 36 [not reproduced]), it is impossible to determine the direction of the operating radars. You see, their signals scatter due to the reflection from the ionosphere. But an even greater advantage over the other assets is obtained by virtue of the capacity to detect plans and cruise missiles with significantly reduced radar cross sections. This advantage is especially important. It is understood that the lower the radar cross section of an object, the later the radar will "see" it. The comparative range of detection of planes with different cross section (the F-117A fighter, the B-1B and B-52 bombers with cross sections of 1, 10 and 100 square meters respectively) according to the calculations of American specialists are shown in figure 37. (FLIGHT, 1988. No. 4142; FLUG REVUE, 1989, No. 1.) From the figure it is clear that the range of detection of the "stealth" aircraft is 3-10 times less than that of conventional planes even in the absence of electronic jamming. Such a short range cannot be compensated for by an increase in the number of ground radars. Therefore the crews of "stealth" planes probably will detect observation of them first, and will take the necessary countermeasures. Figure 37. Comparative range of detection of radars with different radar cross-sections by However, one must disappoint the foreign specialists. For the methods of reducing the radar visibility of aircraft which are known at present are effective only in a limited frequency range (1-20 GHz), in which, it is true, most exist air defense radars still operate. With simultaneous use of radars operating in very different ranges, and with an increase in the wave length of the radiated pulses, the detectability of the "stealth" aircraft will increase. In itself this circumstance cannot provoke any objections, theoretically it is all correct -- the wave length of the over-the-horizon radar is much greater than in radars of the centimeter range. However, the designers do not place very great hopes in the over-the-horizon radars. The fact is that they operate with short waves (10-100 m) and therefore have low resolution of angular coordinates (less than 1x) and determine the location of targets with significant errors, and are susceptible to the influence of natural and artificial interference. In addition, their capabilities of detecting targets depend on the state of the ionosphere. Therefore although air defense does not greatly require precise characteristics of targets at long range, it is still impossible to rely only on over-the-horizon radars. Another means for increasing the range of detection of "stealth" aircraft might be radars with separated transmitters and receivers, so-called two-position, or bistatic radars (fig. 38). The transmitter illuminates the target and the receivers pick up its signals reflected away from the source of radiation. Despite the obvious simplicity of the operating principle of two-position radars, this too has its problems. Detection of "stealth" aircraft is possible only in a limited region, where the beam of the transmitter and the field of action of the receivers intersect. It is also necessary to have apparatus for precise synchronization of operation of transmitter and receivers. Figure 38. Operating principle of two-position radar. I should also mention one fundamentally new means of reconnaissance, possessing unlimited range of detection -- space-based radars. They are just being developed and experimental modes are far from practical utilization. There are many complex design and tactical problems in the path of producing acceptable radar characteristics: development of large space antennas, reduction in the hindering background radiation of the earth, the selection and optimization of surveillance zones, the altitudes and inclinations of orbits for a look at air space of interest to air defense manpower and assets. The creators of space radars hope that these and other problems arising in the course of their development will be resolved. Then, such radars mounted on several satellites, deployed in single orbit and at specific distances from one another, will make it possible to obtain information about the activity of aviation in the most remote regions of basing and over their entire routes to targets with good regularity. Thus integrated use of all means will make it possible to form an external high-altitude thousand-kilometer field and warn the air defense system of the flight of an air adversary in a time which is close to the complete flight time of the planes and missiles of the opposing side. As for engagement of the air adversary at the far approaches to the defended territory, here for the present we can see no other air defense assets except for fighters. Their range of action may be increased by in-flight refueling and their control from air-born command posts. Moved out to pre-established main directions of enemy raids, they will create favorable conditions for successive commitment of fighters to battle at remote perimeters, and also will be capable of interaction with SAM complexes. Naturally the further removal of the points of engagement away from the defended objects and air bases will pose new problems for tactics. What unexpected obstacles and surprises await the pilots in their flight to a remote battle zone? These may include sharp changes in the weather, unreliable communications with ground control centers and a broken radar field, where there is no information about the adversary, and the search for him as he uses various tactical ruses, and the adoption of a decision for the battle from rare target designations from the airborne command post. And what high demands will be put on piloting equipment, apparatus for control of group actions, on tactical proficiency of the flight personnel. Under such circumstances they will require bravery, initiative, and the will for victory. Further centralization and automation of control are required by the need to use more considerable amounts of manpower and assets of air defense, in terms of composition and numbers, in a large volume of air space, and coordination of their actions in shorter time periods. The construction of large and complex systems, centralizing command and control and automating its process, began about thirty years ago. As a result the widely advertised antiaircraft air defense system of the North American continent "SAGE" appeared. Somewhat later a combined air defense system for the NATO countries of Europe was developed and continues to function today. Command and control of air defense assets in this system are centralized, and implemented from "NAGE" automated control centers, providing collection, processing, transmission, and display of data regarding the air situation and the state of combat readiness of air defense assets, target designation of SAM complexes and guidance of fighters. Automation of these processes, and also the elimination of certain intermediate links in the chain of data processing, led to a sharp reduction in time expenditures. In comparison with manual processing of data, the time of passage of data in the semi-automated systems was reduced by 50 percent, and in fully automated systems by 85-90 percent. (ALLGEMEINE SCHWEIZER MILITAERZEITSCHRIFT, 1973, No. 2; TRUPPENPRAXIS, 1975, No. 2.) The advent of highly automated systems, which received intensive development by the end of the 60s, somewhat blunted the attention of military specialists to their further development, but not for long. Today the talk of their development is again going strong. But why has this tendency appeared? The answer lies in two problems which become urgent in air defense. The first has to do with the now inadequate capabilities of existing systems for coordination of efforts of major air defense forces of different armed services and quick reaction to the actions of similar major forces of the air adversary. The second problem is to develop automated systems of command and control and multichannel data lines which would assure integrated command and control of air defense groupings at different levels, and the rational distribution of functions among them. For the time being the elements of command and control which often duplicate one another leads to overload of systems and unjustified losses of time. Consequently, today there are much more complex tasks -- the creation of an air defense system ensuring integrated use of all manpower and assets of air defense with centralized command and control, regardless of their affiliation to a specific armed service. But what interpretation do NATO military specialists impart to the concept of "further centralization and automation of command and control"? It should be noted that it is still not very concrete. The issue is to enlarge the systems within one or adjacent theaters of military action (TVDs), link operational air defense centers with mobile automated systems of troop air defense, a system of reconnaissance and monitoring of air space at a higher level, and subordination of all of them to a single command. In the technical context this tendency is expressed in a higher through-put capacity of the automated control systems, speed of processing and transmission of data in command and control nets, and more importantly, in a uniform software, used in all the computer centers, and access to data for all sub-systems and users. Automatic systems capable of sorting, sifting, synthesizing, and displaying data in accordance with the needs of the various command levels, are simply indispensable here. After all, all the collected data are needed by them to different degrees and in different forms. Too great an amount of data hinders its utilization at the operational level, while at the tactical level, on the contrary, detailed data of each air target is required. However, for now one can speak only of partial successes and realization of individual technical solutions. There are many causes: the difference in views regarding the essence of processes and methods of command and control, the diversity of methods of solving problems given the similarity of targets and the diversity of designed electronic equipment. It is also unclear what machines to use for the software. Broad centralization of command and control undoubtedly will make it possible to achieve a maximal effect in using fighters over extended regions, since they will turn up precisely in the axis and at the time when they are most needed for the repulse of massed strikes. Automatic target distribution and issuance of target designations to pilots from the fighter command post in turn will reduce the cycles of command and control and raise the accuracy of guidance to air targets. However it is still necessary to attain mutual understanding between many levels and precise distribution of command and control functions among them. Acting within the framework of major automated command and control systems, fighter aviation must be committed to battle with special precision in place and time; uncoordinated actions between units, tactical formations and ground air defense assets are unacceptable. High accuracy is needed in using automatic systems for command and control of air-to-air battles, and in all systems based on interaction of man and machine, where issuance of computer recommendations to the commander, automatic generation and transmission of commands to the aircraft are envisioned. Enhancement of the survivability of air defense is associated with the increased capabilities of precision weapons and reconnaissance-strike complexes of the opposing side with regard to electronic suppression of various elements of the air defense system. You see, in any system various electronic equipment are and will be used whose emissions are difficult to conceal from the enemy reconnaissance even in peacetime. With the start of repulse of his raids, the air defense systems will reveal themselves even more by turning on its many radars and communications equipment and will become convenient targets for precision weapons homing in on radiating sources. This tendency has deep roots and a complex history. It found intensive development after the Arab-Israeli conflict of 1967, when the Israeli Air Force succeeded from the very start in inflicting great damage on the aviation of the Arab countries and suppressing their air defense systems. Allowing for the unexpected and dramatic consequences of this conflict, the military air defense commands of many countries immediately began to raise the survivability of their air defense systems. Simple reinforced concrete shelters appeared at airfields for the planes, SAM complexes began to protect airfields, and engineer preparation of radar positions and creation of decoy targets simulating the operation of air defense assets were started. At present this tendency has received new impetus due to the stormy growth in capabilities of the opposing side to engage air defense installations. The reader is already familiar from the preceding chapter with the efforts which aviation has exerted to combat air defense, the difficulties which defense has encountered in the harsh confrontation with the air adversary. It will not be easy to safeguard the security of fighter aviation at airfields. Vulnerability to precision weapons, especially anti-airfield ones, which create small but numerous foci of destruction on the runways (For example, the American DAASM combination munitions, which consists of 8 penetrating charges with high kinetic energy to destroy the runway, and 24 mines, which prevent approach to it. -- AIR FORCES, 1987, No. 11), reduce the fighting capacity of fighter aviation. In addition, a larger portion of modern fighters are poorly adapted to actions from dirt airfields, so fighter aviation is restricted in terms of airfield maneuver. In order to raise the survivability of air defense in all of its links, many measures have been taken. These include expansion of the net of hardened command and control points, fixed, mobile, airborne, and adoption of radars and SAM complexes which are scattered in the terrain, camouflage and concealment from missiles and aerial bombs with electro-optic homing heads, and much else. Of course these measures are quite difficult, and it would be impetuous to judge their effectiveness examining the essence of the ongoing processes, but we are more interested in how the tendency of enhanced survivability is manifested in fighter aviation. Let us begin with the fact that in accordance with this tendency, the need remains for the fighters to be disposed in strong, hardened shelters, the creation of standby runways, and the conduct of other such traditional measures. However precision weapons have vitally devalued them. One can say that now there is no problem with destroying targets at airfields (depending on the range and strength of the weapons), but there does exist a problem of finding them and obtaining precision coordinates. One thing is clear. In the interest of reliable defense of fighter aviation at airfields, it is necessary to ensure maximal covertness of its basing. It is much harder to camouflage airfields than other air defense installations. Today reduction in their tell-tale signs and integrated countermeasures to all types of enemy reconnaissance are now no longer enough. Therefore frequent and rapid relocation of fighter command and control centers, maneuver of subunits from one airfield to another, and also the creation of decoy installations, which make it possible to trick the adversary with respect to the true fighter aviation grouping, are becoming more preferable. * * * In our day fundamentally new means of air attack are being developed and introduced very quickly. The tactical techniques of these assets are changing just as rapidly. And in these surprising leaps, the need to maintain the constant combat readiness of fighter aviation, and raise the tactical proficiency of the flight personnel to repel aggression with minimal losses stands out even more. This then is the principle of defensive sufficiency, flowing from the nature of Soviet military doctrine. PART TWO. TACTICS REVEAL THE SECRETS Chapter V. Before Battle Is Joined 1. Guess or Foresee? Does the pilot, and especially the command have the desire to precisely foresee the coming battle? Yes, this is the goal of their work in preparing for battle. But it is not enough to have a goal, one must also understand how this goal may be achieved, what methods to use. But this question has been answered in different ways at different times. Intuition and inspiration, not a clever plan concocted on the ground, decides the success of battle. They themselves will come to the pilot when he meets the enemy in the air; after all, you can't foresee everything -- such is the assertion living steadfastly on in the consciousness of some pilots from the days of the Great Patriotic War, and one can sometimes hear it even today from people with a poor knowledge of tactics. This is not surprising. Ignorance, dilettantism, guesswork -- these are also a favorable soil for idle arguments and silly conjectures. Practical experience of the past and present demonstrates something different: many of the components of future victory are laid in the successfully developed battle plan. Surprise, closure, rapidity of attack, quick response to sudden critical situations in battle -- all these are derivatives of the well-developed battle plan. No wonder they say that a battle is fought twice: once in thought, then in action. Commanders of all levels, when planning a battle, have long sought to look into the future, to anticipate the enemy actions, who in turn exerted no less effort, through camouflage, concealment and disinformation, to pass off the true for the false and the false for the true. During the front years, battle planning achieved a high level of perfection. On the basis of accumulated experience, logical conclusions, expert assessments, aviation commanders determined ahead of time the nature and time of actions of enemy aviation, the combat capability of the fascist pilots, what "surprises" they were preparing to spring, and then, without strict mathematical criteria, they created in their minds models of the upcoming battle. This allowed them to select and practice an expedient order of action. Many of these models were polished direction in battles in accordance with the answering tactical actions of the adversary, which were hard to foresee. Two-time Hero of the Soviet Union, A. Vorozheykin, predicting the tactics of the adversary in April 1944 in the Lvov axis, noticed that during raids on our forces, the fighters which led the way had the goal of either shooting down our fighter barrier or diverting it away through demonstrative actions and opening a lane to the targets of the strike. In the latter case the fascists, without numerical superiority, approached challengingly close, but did not join battle. Foreseeing the enemy tactics, A. Vorozheykin led his squadron to protect the troops. His prediction was justified. First on the horizon appeared four FW-190s, but seeing that they could not attack the fighters by surprise, they raced to the side, literally exposing themselves to a strike. Soon another pair appeared, and hung over the squadron threateningly. The enemy intent was clear, and the commander did not rush to join battle. He had to wait. And in fact, after a few minutes a report came from the guidance center that a large group of bombers were approaching. This was the decisive minute! The battle was fast-moving, the attacks swift and sudden. The fascists suffered serious damage, and the aimed strike on the troops was thwarted. It is easy to find such analogues of foresight in the experience of local wars. In the Vietnam war, pilots of American Phantoms were baffled: how were North Vietnamese pilots able to intercept them even before they broke from a closed to an open battle formation (to form up for the target approach)? New means of detection, new planes and weapons? Indeed no, in no case. This happened because the air commanders, recording the routes, flight altitudes, and nature of action of the Phantoms were able to foresee their tactics ahead of time. Knowing the habits of the enemy, the North Vietnamese fighters developed and applied a method of combat actions from ambush on the ground and in the air. Secretly flying to forward airfields half-destroyed by American aviation, which the enemy did not notice, they were committed to the battle suddenly and attacked Phantoms flying in a dense battle formation, from close range. In our time it has become much harder than in the past to foresee how events will unfold. The situation has become more fluid and complex, the aviation equipment more diverse. Battle formations dispersed over tens of kilometers, the development of EW assets and much else have changed the picture of confrontation of the sides. The mentally predicted air-to-air battle, and the foresight which air commanders have or do not have, are marked by much greater complexity. How then can one create a reliable and faithful analogue to the battle situation in which the fighters must operate? How can one study that which does not exist, but might (and might not), in a more or less remote future? These are not easy questions. Any prediction is based on elements of the known and quite unfamiliar, but in their aggregate quite predictable things. In one way or another, there is a kind of logic in all things. In tactics everything is always interrelated and controlled at times by obvious threads, more often by invisible ones. Nonetheless, there are secrets to prediction. As a creative process these lie in the objective, law-governed regularities of air-to-air battle, which are knowable. Of course there are some difficulties involved in knowing, and thus in foreseeing. How may they be overcome in order to see these law-governed regularities behind the variety of battle phenomena? In speaking of this, we always operate with concepts such as sound knowledge of the basics of air-to-air combat, equipment, and tactics, one's own and those of the enemy. But knowledge is by no means all. It is not enough to memorize precepts, formulas, numbers. So that they may be reflected in foresight, one must also be able to consider the whole group of factors influencing battle, uncover the deep processes of battle dynamics, their causal relationships. Prediction of future situations is closely associated with the use of probability methods. And what about intuition and inspiration, which come to the aid of the commander? Their role cannot be discarded from the scales, they are very important qualities, which supplement probability methods. But it is rightly said that all intuition is the result of erudition: earlier-accumulated knowledge, acquired experience and skills. Thus it is worth something when it relies on high professional training of the commander, and precise calculation. Before looking into the essence of the questions which have been posed, let us note that the whole circuit of difficult problems of foresight may be found only in special, quite extensive military-science literature. But for us only specific conclusions are important, and in the narrower meaning -- as applied to the sphere of combat actions of fighters. For a clear understanding of the essence of foresight and its practical utilization in planning air-to-air battle, these conclusions may be boiled down to three characteristic features: two-sidedness, soundness, and specificity of foresight. Foresight is a two-sided process, which flows from the essence of dialectics which considers all the phenomena in their inter-relationship and mutual causation. Such an approach is quite complex, since the combat capabilities and tactics of the sides (friendly and enemy) are revealed in a harsh confrontation, are mutually dependent, and constantly being improved. Incorrect allowance for the correlation of combat capabilities of the sides leads to one-sided assessments and may give rise to errors: an overestimate of the capabilities of friendly fighters and an underestimate of the capabilities of the adversary (equating capabilities with realities or vice versa). In tactics an overestimate of one's own capabilities engenders unconcern and conceit. For instance, fighters with weapons sight systems and weapons for long-range attack were given the position of a multiple aircraft air-to-air battle. During planning of the battle, the group leader allowed for the undoubted superiority over the "adversary," who did not have such weapons, and decided to attack him head-on. The pilots had seemingly calculated everything, and the outcome of the battle was already decided. But when the group went aloft and detected the "adversary" it began to close, but did not get to the point of missile launch. The pilots preparing for launch were subjected to a surprise attack from a different group, and in this tactical situation they suffered "losses." One of the causes of the defeat, if not the main one, was the underestimate of the capabilities of the "adversary," who more realistically foresaw the actions of the fighters and allowed for the psychology of their leader, who was aware of his superiority in long-range weapons. At the last moment, on the approach to the expected line of attack, the planes of the "adversary" broke sharply, forming a strike group and a small diversionary element, which foiled the missile strike. The leader did not foresee this turn of events and did not provide for countermeasures. It is no less dangerous to underestimate one's own capabilities and overestimate the capabilities of the adversary. This is precisely what happened with another group of fighters, which was performing the mission of troop defense. The planes of the "adversary" used electronic jamming, the situation at the command post was unclear, and command and control of the fighters was unstable. Under these conditions, the group leader saw a group of bombers which outnumbered the group of fighters. The situation was critical, for the "adversary" was already approaching the targets of the strike. What was to be done? Of course an immediate attack and report to the command post was necessary in order that it build up forces of the attackers, but the leaders, recalling the battle plan, in which such a situation was not envisaged, found nothing better than to avoid battle and continue to hunt for other, smaller targets. One wonders if perhaps he in fact had no other way out. No, he simply underestimated his own capabilities. Remember what Suvorov said: "Not numbers, ability." It was necessary to have the courage to attack a numerically superior "adversary." Passivity in the air was tantamount to cowardice. But then we cannot count quantity as something secondary. For the issue is massing of the efforts of the fighters against larger targets. This could be done by the command post guiding the fighters, if the leader had promptly reported the nature of the target, but he kept silent about the encounter in order to avoid being rebuked for his irresolute actions. The art of foresight is inseparable from the estimate of capabilities of friendly forces. At first glance it would seem that there is frankly speaking nothing to foresee here, since all these capabilities are familiar to the commander. But the fact is that they do not exist in and of themselves, but in comparison with the combat capabilities of the adversary. The capabilities of one and the same subunit, all other things being equal, will be different in battle with an inexperienced or strong enemy. In addition, the adversary himself will take measures, predicting our capabilities and intentions, and what is more, will influence the estimates and logic of the commander in order to direct his actions in a direction favorable to himself. Therefore it is natural to suppose that the adversary first of all will strive to fully utilize his own combat capabilities in order to deliver a strike of maximum strength, and second through camouflage, concealment and disinformation to trick the commander. Thus the enemy plan is almost never manifested with the completeness the commander would wish, or becomes known only after he has passed the lines of commitment of the fighters to battle. The total correlation of combat capabilities of the sides may be expressed most conveniently in quantitative terms, in the number of planes participating in the battle, and in quantitative-qualitative terms, by a comparative assessment of the performance characteristics, weapons and equipment using the existing coefficients of combat potentials, numerical values of combat capabilities, if the qualitative indices are unequal. From the whole variety of various characteristics, it is necessary to select and compare the main ones, which have the greatest importance for accomplishment of the upcoming mission (speed, acceleration, maneuver characteristics of the aircraft, dimensions of radar detection zones and interference protection of the weapons sights, characteristics of the missiles, cannon, and EW equipment). Such a comparison makes it possible to find the areas of superiority of one's fighters in definite ranges of altitudes and speeds, to select expedient tactical techniques depending on the expected actions of the adversary. Thus the two-sidedness of foresight allows the commander not only to more profoundly assess his own capabilities, but also to better foresee the actions of the adversary, which as a rule are a response to the tactics of the fighters. Forcing him to act in the spirit of his own concept, the commander as it were "creates" the situation. Soundness of foresight is based on a profound knowledge of the law-governed regularities of battle, complete abandonment of a subjective approach, earlier-adopted and quite possibly erroneous prejudices and schemes. After all, it sometimes happens that the very same information in the minds of different commanders will acquire a different emotional coloration, and this can lead to an unobjective estimate. However, in addition to the law-governed regularities, a battle is influenced by accidents, with which the air situation is replete. Sometimes a pilot miscalculates in battle and tries to explain this as an accidental confluence of circumstances which it is hard to foresee, and at times impossible. Is this really the case? As the philosophers say, randomness is an objective category. Even in the most improbable event, after it has occurred they strive to find the law-governed regularities. It is hard for us to resist this temptation too. The adversary is before us. His behavior in battle cannot be considered random, but it is not repeated many times either. A smart adversary always proceeds from our logic, strives to foresee it, and strives not to use a single tactical technique. Let us return to the example in which the leader, underestimating the capabilities of the "adversary," was subjected to a surprise attack, when victory was close. Did this situation develop by accident? No, for the "adversary" nothing at all unexpected happened. He calculated his battle plan and worked it through ahead of time. But our leader, planning his battle, did not suspect that he would operate according to the decision which the "adversary" had foreseen. The situation became critical also due to the unreadiness of the fighters for a maneuver battle. So were these two events accidental? Certainly not! They were both a consequence of the convergence of two objective and mutually independent causes. Held captive by prejudiced and desired estimates, the group leader himself promoted the first of them, and the second came about due to the unexpectedness of the first. Of course one could relate differently to such unsuccessful planning. One could reason like this, for instance: are there many accidently, unforeseen situations in battle? Since they are unforeseeable, why not avoid them? After all, battle is battle. Anything might happen. But in this case can one say that accidents happened? That they were simply inevitable? If they did not happen, this would contradict common sense. No wonder they say that accident is an unknown principle in operation. This familiar saying sounds particularly apt in this situation. Such accidents could have been prevented or at least reduced to a minimum if the leader was able to foresee this natural turn of the battle. The commander cannot foresee precisely what tactical tricks the adversary would prepare for deception and disinformation of the fighters in the given battle, cannot know who would detect whom first, in what specific situation the fighters would be relative to the adversary. He cannot have an idea either of further failures of aviation equipment or ground control assets due to their reliability, or errors which the pilots might commit at a given stage of the battle. For example, the very fact of detection of an adversary on the left of the battle formation of the group, or an error of one of the pilots in aiming, are random events. Even if such events are of low probability, this does not prevent them from appearing, but one must allow for these accidents, and take the necessary measures. Consequently, of course one can predict the occurrence of a particular accident, but one cannot predict a specific manifestation of it with respect to place, time, or form. Foresight in most cases is presumptive in nature and most often is based on probability methods. This means that estimates are based on average results and make it possible to determine only a tendency of development of the process in question. But the final outcome of accomplishment of a mission is random, one can only construct suppositions about it. Low values of indices of effectiveness of combat actions of fighters by no means rule out the possibility of victory. Sometimes they show that the developed plan of battle is not the best, and it is necessary to look for other alternatives. The basis of foresight is the hypothesis, a presumption with a certain level of probability. Here it is easy to go wrong. Therefore one cannot rush to unequivocal assessments, but one can and should foresee the range of possible changes of the situation, i.e., a certain amount of variants of the battle. Here in order to remove or rightly allow for uncertainty of the situation, one must also allow both for the completeness and the reliability of the existing data, and for the commander's will, which links the reliable information with the supposed. But the amount of each of these components is different. Let us suppose that you know the combat missions and intentions of the adversary, but in the other case you know only that the adversary will be somewhere in the sky. The answer is clear. The more complete the data, the more weighty will be the contribution made to foresight by strict calculations, the less data, the greater the role played by suppositions, logic, and the commander's will. But will the prediction always be justified? To think this is to think the enemy a fool. The soundness of foresight lies in discerning tendencies of the predicted battle, which operate as an objective necessity, and arise as a result of accidents or voluntary decisions. Specificity of foresight consists in the directness, the purposefulness and flexibility of the thinking process of the commander. It makes it possible to narrow the circle of analyzed situations and vary only the group of those which are typical for the expected situation, and also quickly correct one's estimates when it changes. Of course each commander is interested in most completely imagining the picture of the coming battle, more deeply getting at the essence of its contradictions. But foresight is exercised not for the satisfaction of idle curiosity. In order not to drown in secondary questions, for the assigned combat mission the commander must first correctly clarify what precisely he wants to foresee, know at a minimum what he is striving for. The answer to this question may be found not so much in the content of the combat mission itself, as in what is known and unknown to the commander, and does he need to know what he doesn't know. But if the commander has only a vague idea of what he wants, then numerous assessments of the most diverse situations, the method of trial and error, will not help him. Two-sidedness and soundness of foresight does not change the essence of the matter. It is a question chiefly of the level of detail, the accuracy of foresight, the distinguishing of precisely those situations which have decisive importance for planning of the specific battle. Ideally the battle plan is, indisputably, as specific as possible. But an excessively rigid plan, overloaded with specifics and details, not only is difficult to execute, forcing the pilots to devote a greater part of their attention to keeping the set order of actions, but also hampers them in reacting to the actually developing situation. Sometimes one encounters commanders who, on the contrary, try to plan the battle in the most general outlines. They construct the model of an enemy raid, distribute fight forces along the point of engagement, announce the procedures for command and control and interaction, and believe that they have planned the battle. Such planning, where all specific actions of the pilots are left to the will of circumstance, testifies to poor tactical proficiency on the part of the commander. Therefore the level of detail of planning, and consequently also of foresight, should respond to the requirement not to constrain the reasonable initiative and tactical thinking of the pilots, but at the same time to permit allowance for the greatest number of factors of the combat situation. But will prediction always be accurate? To think it will is to insult the adversary. It is impossible to achieve absolutely accurate values of all parameters of expected actions in battle, and the results of foresight will always differ to some degree from the actual development of events. And indeed, what sort of guaranteed accuracy of prediction of enemy actions can there be if even the battle formation of the subunit cannot be maintained with absolute precision and with those parameters which the commander puts in the battle plan? Nor is such ideal realization of foresight required. Everything depends on for whose interests it is conducted. Suppose that a pair or flight of fighters is preparing for an air-to-air battle. Here it is necessary to carefully calculate the conditions and procedures for accomplishment of literally each maneuver, one's own and the adversary's one is to fight. The regiment commander does not require such specificity. For him, it is enough to foresee the totality of these conditions and maneuvers as the foundation for development of a battle plan of the fighter subunits combined by a common concept. But even here foresight should be adequately specific. For example, if the commander needs to plan a battle while protecting ground troops, he must limit himself to prediction of the actions of only that enemy aviation may deliver strikes on the troops in the protected region, and only in the given time of protection. This of course does not rule out a situation in which the subunit is small but accomplishes an important task (individual flight or pair acting to tie down the adversary in the interests of all other tactical groups) and becomes the object of the close attention of the commander. Limitation of the framework of foresight in accordance with the scale of the task to be performed allows the commanders of various levels to forego "global" assessments and vagueness of thought, and to focus on the search for answers only to those questions which flow from the non-specificity of the situation. Thus two-sidedness, soundness and specificity make it possible to predict the air situation, however complex it may be, to consider it not as a manifestation of "chaotic," "blind" randomness, but the result of actions of the adversary and friendly fighters. It is precisely foresight which serves as the criterion for the commander's farsightedness and tactical thinking. Now the times themselves pose the question: How then can we plan a battle which has a fair amount of variants? 2. Calculate Seven Times, Decide Once One can clearly sin against truth if one says that after receiving a combat mission the commander and his pilots immediately begin to plan the battle. No, at times they do not know how to approach the planning, and as their knowledge and skills will allow they try to foresee the conditions of the upcoming battle. Usually the pilots first look for analogies, more or less similar to a situation with which they are familiar. They use them for subsequent discussions and comparisons with the expected situation, they strive to think for the adversary, to delve into his possible assessments, decisions, tactics, socio-psychological aspects determining his behavior in battle. And the latter tries to do every thing to conceal his plan and to force his will on the fighters. Thus there is always a danger that one will fall victim to artful camouflage and disinformation by the adversary. One must also allow for many other circumstances which do not lead to unequivocal assessments. Opportunities for comprehensive allowance for diverse conditions which may arise in battle are offered by modelling, which allows one to reproduce, study and analyze all the ups and downs of engagement and development of battle, to qualitatively predict its results. Modelling in tactics as a method of scientific foresight for the time being remains the basis for planning air-to-air battles. The two-sided process of foresight also requires two-sided modelling. Here one can assume that the general law-governed regularities of tactics are objective, and to a significant degree apply to both opposing sides. Each of the sides strives to create conditions which are favorable for the actions of their forces, and at the same time to counter the analogous aspirations of the adversary. Consequently the model of an upcoming battle may be presented in the form of two interrelated models. On the one hand, the model of the expected actions of the adversary, and, on the other, the model of the battle with him. There can be very many such models. Today simulating and modelling complexes are already being developed which include automatic control systems of fighter control centers, integrated simulators for pilots, and data-display equipment, and numerous models of air-to-air battles have been developed and displayed on computers. These allow automated vectoring of the pilots to the battle region, realization of the commander's decision to destroy the air targets, modelling and testing of tactical techniques and maneuvers for specific situations in battle with any aircraft of the adversary. But what if the regiment still does not have such complexes? Then the traditional, graphic-analysis modeling still remains in force. Of course its basis is monotonous, hard work to register a whole series of calculations. But even the simplest techniques of graphic-analysis modelling, with which the pilots are quite familiar, make it possible to calculate and analyze various situations of battle. At any moment one can compare what happens if when such-and-such maneuvers are used, the adversary responds in such-and-such a manner. If you have doubts, change the conditions and repeat the modelling. But for all the multiplicity of modelled situations, one should proceed from the fact that the adversary, by selecting the axis and the time of the raid, determines the conditions of the battle only at the very start. Subsequently the fighters can force their own will and tactics on him, not forgetting however that the adversary will seek to do the same to them. The very posing of the question shows the direct link between modelling and foresight. All these truths are meant for the uninitiated reader. Pilots, not to mention air commanders, are well aware of the rich possibilities offered by modelling of air-to-air battles. But then, we will not go into the details and nuances of modelling. There are no cliche techniques here, as there are no identical air-to-air battles. Each pilot, depending on the level of his knowledge, experience and even temperament, will proceed in his own way, but the first step is always the same, that is, clarification of the task, the goals of modelling, and selection of tactical situations. But how many, and which situations should be chosen from those that are possible? If one takes all possible situations for modelling, one will simply bog down in a sea of calculations. No unequivocal answer can be found in a single book of tactics, for this would contradict the very nature of the creative thought process, which is specific in each separate case. For any air-to-air battle, depending on the expected actions of the adversary, the weather conditions and other conditions, one must model a certain number of situations. They will not be the same number of situations, and are determined first of all by the level of indeterminacy of the situation. Some of the components of its factors are known, others remain undiscovered for some time, and perhaps remain unknown. An identical answer is as impossible as a single plan of battle for different conditions. There are many answers, and even more approaches. Here is one of them. Let us suppose that it is necessary to plan actions of fighters to perform two combat missions of differing content: interception and an air-to-air battle with enemy planes in repulse of a massed raid, and conduct of a "hunt." When planning an interception and air-to-air battle on the basis of knowledge and prediction of the general principles, combat strength and disposition of the enemy forces in a massed raid, guided by the logic of his thinking and by available information, one can construct a model of the raid, foresee the tactics of the groups and individual crews, but one should not count on a detailed, reliable model. When planning a "hunt," the level of indeterminacy is even greater. Where will the adversary be encountered, will it happen at all, what types of planes will there be, their number, the battle formation, the resistance by air defenses -- all this is known only approximately, or not at all. But on the other hand, there are a number of well-known factors which are determined by the content of the combat mission and the conditions of its accomplishment, and do not require prediction. These include the flight models to the interception and to the "hunt" region, the points of engagement of the fighters, the corridors for passage of the front line upon returning from combat missions. For all the diversity of combat missions, one cannot fail to note the similarity here: the indeterminacy of the situation related to the adversary, and the unambiguity of the parameters flowing from the mission content, which may be accepted in the capacity of starting data for modelling. Consequently, it appears possible to specifically and in detail determine the procedures for the takeoff of subunits, their movement to the points of engagement or to the "hunt" region, and the tactical techniques of the search, i.e., everything that the pilots do before they encounter the adversary. As for further actions, the higher the level of indeterminacy of the actions, the less strict and detailed the modelling should be. Such a variable level of modelling, in terms of level of preciseness, at different stages of planning a combat flight, which flows from the specificity of foresight, is evident in itself, and does not arouse particular objections. "But what if I know everything about the adversary?" a persistent reader may ask. "Can't you then avoid spreading yourself too thin on numerous situations, and stay with one, and construct one, precise model of the upcoming actions? For example, I am given a simple mission using a flight to intercept a non-maneuvering target, whose characteristics and altitude have already been reliably established at the command post controlling the fighters." Answering this question, let us accept such an assumption (even if it is extremely dubious) and let's see if the other conditions for accomplishment of the mission are so unshakable that one can restrict oneself to a single model. You of course will allow for information about the adversary, the terrain, and weather, and in accordance with the combat capabilities of one's flight (and that you will know thoroughly), and you will construct an appropriate model. It goes without saying that if the airborne complex and weapons allow an attack on the target in the forward hemisphere, you will choose the most favorable from among possible conditions -- closure with the adversary head to head, when it is not necessary to conduct a visual search which burdens pilot attention. But why do you refrain from other variants in modelling a battle, even with an adversary known to you? After all, the not-so-unexpected might happen, and instead of a long-range battle, you might be forced to fight a close-range air-to-air battle. And when there is a close-range battle, you have to seek the target with your eyes. There are many reasons for this: errors in calculation of the CP and the pilots themselves, retargeting of the fighters, etc. Such are the moments of reckoning for a single model! In forecasting the conditions for accomplishment of an at-first-glance simple combat mission, you selected the most possible situation from your standpoint, and discarded the less possible (but not impossible!). And among them are those which radically change the nature of actions of the fighters. Thus it would be illogical to limit oneself to structuring of one model even with the uncompromising conviction that "I know everything about the adversary," just as with regard to the other "known" factors, including friendly combat capabilities, interrelated with and inseparable from other conditions of the situation. An element of indeterminacy is a vital, fundamental property of almost any air situation, and the degree of this indeterminacy may be very high. But it seems to me that in this case there are not and cannot be circumstances and factors which were not predicted at all; only the specificity of the foresight will be different. It may be only in general outlines, but one must predict everything. But if it is impossible to obtain reliable data for sound conclusions, one must assess the situation as a whole with allowance from multi-variant development of the situation. However not only the indeterminacy of the situation has its affect on the number of modeled situations. After all, it often happens that even in similar situations one can operate in different ways. Using the terminology of cybernetics, one can say that one and the same event may be displayed by different models. They will all enjoy equal rights. But the situation forces one to arrive at a quite specific decision. Here one cannot manage without volitional qualities, without experience and intuition of the commander. Nonetheless, one can clarify a certain law-governed regularity in the relation of the foundation of calculation to that of will. Let us recall the simple and wise popular saying: "Measure seven times, cut once." Rephrasing it, we can say, "Calculate seven times, decide once." For all the provisional nature of this formula, it is quite apropos here. The foundation of calculation (7:1) in modelling is given a clear preference. And the commander with his assistants carefully and repeatedly calculates all the details of the battle. As a result of repeated, two-sided modelling of tactical situations, they may be reduced to several variants of battle and for each of them characteristic, specific attributes have been distinguished. How then to select that variant which makes it possible to perform the assigned mission in the best way? Of course, by comparison. There is no other way of selecting the variant; here there are many things unclear. The main question is, How may we compare the variants with one another and draw a conclusion in favor of one or another of the variants? Everything depends on the goals which must be achieved by the fighters in accomplishing the given combat mission. One need only select the corresponding indices. Unreliable indices are like a compass which confuses us, and draws us off course. If the goal of the battle is formulated wrongly, then the searches for an optimal variant, headed in the wrong direction, may lead to an attempt to achieve secondary goals. For example, in an air-to-air battle when providing troop protection, one of the indices will be the mathematical expectation of the number of targets destroyed by the fighters. However one cannot but allow for where they will be destroyed relative to friendly troops (the adversary should not have time to launch a strike) and at what cost the success will be achieved, i.e., what friendly losses will be. When the planes are supported by other arms of aviation, the indices are different: the degree of protection of the defended planes, the number of attacks repulsed, and also friendly losses. The mathematical expectation of the number of downed fighters of the adversary has secondary importance. In actions against ground targets in aerial reconnaissance, other indices have decisive importance. The contradictory nature of all of these indices does not allow us to find the best (optimal) variant simultaneously in terms of each of them. Thus one must have an integral index of effectiveness, i.e., one which allows for the attainment of all goals. Here one of the indices should be taken as the main one, and the rest are given the value of limitations, especially the index of friendly losses. This index directs one to cheerless thoughts. Plan the death of pilots ahead of time? What's the sense of this? No, not plan, but minimize the index. The possibility of great losses not only does not permit, it directly forbids acknowledgement of a battle variant as advisable if even in the stage of development it threatens the fighters with significant harm. Consequently, any battle variant must have a precisely set goal and meet the strict requirements of every combat mission. Universal variants do not exist. Of course, in using battle variants, however many there may be, it is impossible to allow for all the variety of the air situation, but they do create indisputable advantages for the commander. Let us suppose that in planning a battle you have decided to have in the battle formation of the squadron both decoy elements and strike elements, and also a reserve element to protect the first two, and intend for buildup of efforts in the battle. Does this mean that such a disposition of forces is always retained when battle is joined? No, the pilots must be ready to change roles. It is best for that element to attack the adversary which is in the most favorable position. It may happen that the reserve is the first to join battle. Then the other elements must immediately reform for its protection, or for execution of a decoy maneuver. There may also be other situations, but pre-planned variants give the pilots the possibility of finding their bearings more confidently in the situation, more quickly seeing the chances for success, and psychologically reorienting themselves. And so we conclude that multi-variant planning of battle makes it possible to obtain precise quantitative estimates and foresee the results of battle on the basis of two-sided modelling. This conclusion does not give grounds for excessive optimism. If we were to model certain air-to-air battles of the Great Patriotic War, for example, from the mathematical and even logical estimates, they will not fit into the generally accepted indices. However, these battles desire our admiration. A bold group of seven fighters under the command of Major B. Yeremin joined battle with 25 fascist planes, and after downing eight of them, gained the victory; Captain A. Gorovets destroyed nine bombers in just one battle. Thus the models of those battles, formulated in the heads of the front-line troops, allowed for still other factors. In those days there were also many unsuccessful battles, whose modelling today would give higher results. Unfortunately, today we cannot allow for everything, no matter how complex the mathematical techniques to which we try to reduce the battle variant. No mathematical apparatus, no computer can eliminate or even discover errors of tactical thinking. Therefore, to repose vain hopes, and blindly believe in the force of models, is simply harmful. The development of battle variants is not exhausted by the intricacies of modelling, and does not completely fit in the framework of even complex calculations. They only reinforce tactical thinking with precise quantitative estimates. However let us recall the place of the volitional foundation in modelling, and the ratio of 7:1. The dialectic of development of battle variants is such that despite will, experience and intuition of the commander, strict calculations come first. But how impatient we are at times in our desire to obtain the final results! Do we allow for untested, doubtful data and details, or only the most visible surface attributes of situations, do we strive to control the uncontrollable urge to "cut" immediately, without any calculations, simply on the basis of common sense, "by eye"? 3. How Many Tactical Techniques? This question might sound strange, but it arises in the commander and his pilots each time in planning an air-to-air battle. In order to answer it, first let us consider what we want to get from the tactical technique. Any tactical technique should correspond to the general concept of the battle, allow for the expected actions and tactical tricks of the adversary, allow its executors rapid and even instantaneous determination of the appropriateness of a particular, planned tactical procedure for the developing specific situation in the course of battle. It is still necessary to achieve covertness of actions in order to outwit the adversary. The necessary requirements for a tactical technique are the possibility of its development by several variants in battle, and simplicity of execution. Of course, it has nothing in common with stubborn straightforwardness, and entails abandonment of far-fetched complications which would require useless expenditure of forces to overcome. Nor should we forget about reliable protection from attack by enemy fighters, which requires allocation of part of the forces, or of tactical and fire coordination in groups. This list of requirements is a kind of methodological approach to development of tactical techniques, and it may be viewed from the standpoint of assessment of their "tactical cost." Unfortunately, real battle gives the true price of the technique, but fortunately, the tactical attainments of the adversary are also subordinate to this same criterion. Is the variety of tactical techniques large? Yes, there are quite many, and this is necessary to provide the pilots with a choice of a rational one in the conditions of indeterminacy of the air situation. Such a situation may develop as a result of actions of the adversary, changes in the weather, and other circumstances which cannot be unequivocally determined ahead of time. Here resides all the complexity of the question. Even in one and the same situation, several variants may be found, while sometimes the tactical technique may prove to be the one. Therefore the number of tactical techniques in itself says nothing. If failure befalls you, this means that the technique did not correspond to the situation, or was poorly executed. However, in arguing about the number of tactical techniques, at times we meet the statement that (having) many tactical techniques is good, and having few is bad. Is there an index of quality of tactics? Will it not happen that in the search for new techniques we will operate by the slogan "Let it be worse, as long as it's different"? There should not be stagnation in tactics, but this does not mean that everything new is ingenious. Imagine that when closing with a maneuvering target you have applied an original tactical technique, but its results are worse in comparison with some already known, you attacked a target using a new technique, but it entailed a hazard to flight safety. Should such tactical innovations be encouraged? There is much innovation, but what is the ultimate result? After all, it is determined not by the degree of innovation of the tactical technique, but by the effectiveness of accomplishment of the combat mission. However much a pilot may wax sarcastic about the cliche nature of already known tactical techniques, a situation in which the race for quantity becomes an end itself is already bad. They say that the great scientist Einstein once was making a note in his little notebook. Answering a question from those around him, he said that he was writing down his thoughts. "Why such a little notebook then?" asked one curious person. "Because good thoughts don't occur to one that often," the scientist replied with a smile. There it is! And sometimes we try everything we can to think up yet another tactical technique, so that we have a lot of them, we fill up thick workbooks, and later on we ourselves can't understand the notes. But on the other hand, you won't go far repeating customary tactical techniques. There is a rule in pedagogy that simple repetition, regardless of the number of repetitions, only strengthens skills, but does not bring perfection. This is also the case in tactics, in unthinking repetition of the same mechanical tactical techniques. Modern tactical techniques of fighters have achieved a high level of sophistication. Sometimes it appears that tactics has entered a period in which everything that can be improved has already been improved, and some sort of tactical ceiling has been reached, which it makes no sense to go beyond. Is this the case? Once upon a time a young pilot in the circle of his comrades expressed the interesting idea that, as he put it, the time of creativity in the search for tactical techniques had disappeared along with the piston aircraft and subsonic speeds. Now they must not learn creativity, but execute the flight program and the commands from the ground. All of his actions were programmed, all the tasks were carried out by "smart" instruments. Those were the work of Chkalov's day, when new methods of attack were in stormy development, and high aerobatic maneuvers were being developed! Yes, Valeriy Chkalov improved the existing and searched for new methods of using his aviation equipment and weapons. He was not satisfied by the existing views, according to which a target could be attacked only from conventional horizontal flight. Despite the established rules, he proposed and developed other variants of attack, including the delivery of fire with the aircraft "on its back," and for the first time in the world executed maneuvers such as the "slow roll" and the "climbing spin." Precisely these maneuvers were used later on in vertical maneuver combat which became dominant among Soviet fighters during the Great Patriotic War. Chkalov's contemporaries were always struck by his erudition, his knowledge of aerodynamics and the equipment which he flew, and his creative attitude toward his job. Indisputably, present-day aviation equipment is incomparable with the equipment of the thirties, which Chkalov mastered, but have Chkalov's times ended? No, creativity in tactics cannot disappear from our profession. What is more, the diversity of tactical techniques characterizes the pilot, determines his style, his signature. Creativity is the accomplishment of non-typical tasks, the creation of the new and original. Creativity of the fighter pilot is of a special sort. It is subordinate to the mission of destruction of the air adversary, and under the conditions which are complex and hard-to-predict. It is expressed not only in the creation of tactical techniques which are new in concept and execution, but also in their capable selection from a group of those already existing. This means that the nature of the new in tactics is such that it often is born in the core of the old. Before we move forward, it is necessary to comprehensively consider what has been accumulated, with allowance for the requirements of today. There is truth to the joke that "The new is the long-forgotten old." Thus tactical techniques of group maneuver battle, sharpened to perfection at the front, and forgotten in the 50s, later on were reborn on a new foundation; the cannon fire, once consigned to oblivion, blazes again in air-to-air conflict. Of course the importance of experience of bygone wars is not all the same: it was greater in the first postwar years, when basically the equipment of the concluding period of the war was in the armament of fighter aviation, and less in the subsequent period, with transition to new equipment and with the introduction of correctives to the theory of the air-to-air battle. Nonetheless, we continue to study the experience of bygone wars and exercises, and we seek in them the answers to problems of present-day battle, and try to avoid the repetition of errors. We proceed to the new in tactics also through hard pondering of today's experience, we study the capabilities of modern equipment, we "probe" the tactics of the adversary, we collect crumb-by-crumb everything interesting which is occurring in the practice of the best pilots. Alas veins of gold are not everything discovered -- tactical techniques are not put in our hands ready-made, but this by no means diminishes the importance of the question. However, it is apropos to recall that blind copying of something, even the best experience, does not replace the personal touch. Look carefully at one's practice and you will most likely find that you can add something to tactics. This may be, for example, a different combination of practiced piloting situations, or unexpected changes in simple maneuvers, in the models of battle. Even the experienced enemy may become flustered in the face of such changes. After all, he may have to change an adopted decision under a time shortage, and this is a quite complex process. On the basis of personal experience, new ideals open up, and thought is spurred. It is impossible to learn to fight a battle only on the basis of others' attainments and errors. How then are new tactical techniques born? The search in tactics cannot be boiled down to some sort of accidental enlightenment, a flash of intuition, although this might happen in battle. The search begins on the ground, in the preparation for flight. It begins with development and accumulation of battle variants. Here calculation, repeated modelling, tests and playing out of variants, comprehensive testing of the obtained models, their necessary practical application. In discussing variants of battle, pilots due to the essence of a particular situation, learn to soundly prove the essence of their arguments (truth is born out of controversy). This makes it possible "roughly" to be ready for actions in the air. There remains only to link the arising situation, from a certain number of traits, to a prepared tactical technique, and the habit of thinking creatively ensures rapid determination of the technique which is optimal for the given situation. At the same time, new tactical techniques often are born directly in battles, with unexpected changes in the situation. Nonetheless, if the pilot does not model a variant similar to such changes on the ground, in the air he will find himself in a very difficult situation. Hard mental labor aimed at foreseeing possible situations will always promote creativity in the air. But then even now some theorists believe that better has to mean more complicated. In the race after new tactical techniques, they solve tough mathematical equations, operate with many indices relating various characteristics of friendly and enemy planes, but they do not allow for the living human being, the pilot. Knowledge is transformed into dogma, methodical approaches become law, a distinctive, hard-to-understand terminology is formed. It seems to me that tactics constitutes techniques which are simple in their essence, but hard for the adversary to puzzle out in detail. And probably there is nothing more reasonable than the sense of harmony between the complexity of concept of the tactical technique and its practical feasibility. Tactical techniques arise out of the need for them. If we perceive this need, and it does not disappear when some other technique is used, that means that we need another, more effective one. To develop truly necessary tactical techniques requires sound theoretical knowledge and modelling skills, but that is not enough. In battle there is no one you can describe your knowledge and skills to, and no point to doing so. You also need the desire to seek out the new in tactics, to find in it the you of creativity, to view it not as something extraordinary, but as an indispensable trait of the pilot profession. There is a widely-shared viewpoint that the new and progressive will inevitably, sooner or later win out, will fight its way through. Perhaps we simply are not aware of the fate of those tactical innovations which did not win out. What destroyed them? Passivity of the pilots, the resistance to change of the leaders, the impatience with "dissidence" in tactics in the period of stagnation? Imagine that you are preparing for an air-to-air battle, possessing exhaustive information on the adversary, who is not expected to put up serious resistance. Are special tactical devices required under such testing range conditions, so to speak, in order to achieve victory? Here open actions, in which there is no place for improvement of tactics, are natural and logical, but the unsoundness of such actions is also evident. Here is another example, when despite the complex situation and the boldness of the pilots in their tactical decisions, the baggage of knowledge accumulated over long years, the experience of the senior officer plans the role of a conservative force and prevents looking at the tactics in a new way. In one squadron, during preparation for the next evaluation testing, they decided to shine before the higher command with a new tactical technique, which significantly raised the effectiveness of intercept of air targets. How much effort, time, and thought was expended to develop it, only the pilots themselves know! It was all calculated and tested, but... when the senior officer, now a former officer, was acquainted with this technique, he categorically forbade using it, and even accused the squadron commander of adventurism. "Why should we risk something new and difficult?" the officer reasons. "All the actions of the pilots are written out in the governing documents," he stated, feeling no embarrassment. "Just follow the instructions as required, and nothing else." Of course by no means every technique must be encouraged, but it is necessary to look into it, so as not to discourage creativity. Of course the following sortie to intercept a hypothetical adversary, known to be weak, to top it off, was successful, but if one can put it thus, it was reminiscent of a woodcut of a blue, cloudless landscape, the embodiment of a problem-free situation. The squadron commander bent over his desk and thoughtfully examined the separate models of the upcoming battle. Both he and his colleagues had two variants: one the usual, which the pilots often used, the other more complex, since it was associated with energetic maneuvering, and required high flying proficiency, but promised the greater success. It would seem that the commander had no reason to ponder for long, that the conclusion was more than obvious: he had to operate by the second variant. But the commander could not forget the unsuccessful example of his neighboring squadron and had good grounds for doubt. The two developed variants of the battle he saw as two paths: the first was off road, untraveled, in which there were more chances of error, the second was well worn, one might say "classical" in its simplicity. The all-justifying call to remember only flight safety was a reliable shield for the second variant. After all, in the event of failure the commander would again be accused of adventurism, excessive independence. And he chose the second, well-worn path. Who likes to be told off, with no attention paid to those around him? "Nothing doing," the squadron commander waved aside his creativity, opting for a calm course of service. "Am I smarter than the others? Better not to tempt fate." And he set off to assign the mission to his subordinates. I won't undertake to say the mood with which the pilots greeted the decision of their commander, but it would appear that they were not especially upset. "It's typical phoniness" the reader will probably snap, and he would be right. I too got mad, and when the pilots returned to the air field, I went up to them and inquired how the battle had gone. Some spoke of the easy victory over the "adversary" and were happy at the success, others argued that they did not have to make any maneuvers for secrecy or swiftness of attack. The squadron commander without a shadow of embarrassment in his voice, as if he were speaking of practicing some elements of combat application, answered me: "What is this about? After all, everything is hypothetical in our training, and we did win the battle. Anyway, I don't understand why we need these training complications." Here, no longer concealing his irritation, the officer continued (the well-worn path did its work), "Let a real war come, then we'll show the enemy what we can do. Anyway, why are you interested in this case? That's the way it will be tomorrow and the day after." I explain my interest: it's better to suffer a defeat in a training battle today, but to gain the new experience which will bring victory in the future. Of course one can cling for some time to general words of the dubiousness of using complex tactical techniques in combat training, and of the remote aspects of a real battle. But there it will be different, if you select and use a good tactical technique, you will save yourself and your comrades, and win a victory, if you don't, then blame yourself, as they say. There are not many such cases in the experience of combat training now, but the cost of each of them is very high. False opinions have appeared suggesting that creativity in tactics is the domain of the select, a mystery behind seven seals, a gift of the gods. But in fact, any thinking person is capable of creativity, and what is more, can learn creativity. This is why we seek out new tactical techniques again and again. How many tactical techniques should one have? Ten, twelve, a hundred? Sometimes it seems that they may be counted, especially if the types of aircraft, the numerical strength of the adversary, the place and other conditions of the battle are known. Flight commander Capt. Ye. Kaberov, knowing these conditions, together with his pilots developed a battle plan in detail. They selected and calculated standard tactical techniques of battle; they seemingly covered all tactical situations of the flight. But the unexpected happened: whether the "adversary" received precise information from the ground, or whether he himself used some technique unknown to the flight commander, the latter detected him too close, on a pursuit intercept course, and significantly lower. When the "enemy" planes flashed by to the left under him, the captain realized that if he structured a maneuver for turn to attack by the whole flight, as envisaged in preparation for battle, he would lose the initiative. He required another tactical technique, but precisely one which would correspond to the situation. To the commander's credit, he did not lose his head. "Six-hundred thirty, attack!" the officer ordered the leader of the second pair, which was behind in a more favorable position for the attack. "Six-hundred thirty," understanding the commander's intent, executed an energetic turn to the right and delivered an accurate strike. The commander with his wingman supplemented the force of the strike. The battle was won. "The hundred-and-first tactical technique," joked the pilots, assembling after landing. "How many tactical techniques do you have to have?" "Just as many as you need in different situations," answered Kaberov. And you have to agree with that answer. Perhaps you won't have to improvise in every battle, but you always have to know how to find the tactics which were not envisaged in the battle plan. The main thing here is to precisely determine the situation from which one can proceed to selection of a suitable technique. * * * And so preparation for battle is concluded. The battle plan has been drawn up and studied. The commander is certain that each pilot knows where to go and what to do. Everyone is intent on victory. It goes without saying that it will depend not just on the hopes of the commander. It would of course be nice to fight a battle if it were waged only under the condition that the battle plans were flawless, and the tactical techniques promised every chance of success. There are no such chances, there is a pitched battle, in which not everything shown in the plan is precisely repeated. The method of trial and error always entails great losses. For every error in battle planning one must pay not the low costs of an exercise, but human lives. Painstaking battle planning in variants, based on profound foresight, a group of prepared and practiced tactical techniques, and a readiness for action in unexpected situations, these are what the pilot needs first of all, when battle breaks out. Chapter VI. So As to Win in Battle 1. Fully Utilize the Capabilities of the Weapons I shall begin with a fact which is well known to pilots. You take off to intercept an air target. After receiving information from the CP about its characteristic, height and distance, you mull it over and seek out an appropriate variant of battle, developed before the sortie and promising the greatest success, you compare your capabilities with the capabilities of the adversary. If your plane has greater speed, you will be able to intercept the adversary more quickly, catch up with him or at the most critical moment break away from pursuit; if your maneuver characteristics are better, you can more effectively conduct the maneuver battle; if your weapons are better, you can hit the target more accurately, and from farther away. This truth today requires serious augmentation. The fact is that it is not all that easy to completely utilize the high potential capabilities of present-day aviation equipment. In flying a high-speed aircraft, one cannot go beyond the limits of the existing limitations. But if a pilot wants to go beyond these limits, he does so in modes which are close to critical and cannot execute an energetic maneuver for attack or evasion of a strike. At such moments he must fight not with the enemy, but with his aircraft. The fear of violating safety measures forces the pilots to pay more attention to maintaining various flight modes, and limits the maneuver capabilities of the fighters. The zones where he is allowed to launch missiles are strictly regulated, so working with the sight, and tracking while observing the set launch parameters, demand a great deal of attention. In the past the high effectiveness of utilization of airborne machineguns and cannon was achieved by firing at maximally short range. Today the spectrum of firing distances is quite wide, and such an approach is completely inapplicable to missile launches. Consequently, however surprising and remarkable the capabilities that fighters may posses, they may remain unused under difficult battle conditions. This is why the attainment of maximal effectiveness, i.e., complete use of the capabilities of aviation equipment, has today become an independent and no less complex problem than that of the development of new models. For example, at your disposal you have various types of missiles, and a cannon, and you have to use this mighty armament in a group, and differently in different battle situations. First of all, you have to correctly choose the moment of the start of utilization and the transition from one type of weapon to another. It is determined by the direction of attack, the speed of closure with the adversary, the distance to him, and the expected countermeasures. Second, it is necessary to create the most favorable conditions for the use of the selected weapons. Thus for missile launch at a given hemisphere of a maneuvering target, the fighter must as a rule be in the range of missile fire. When firing with the cannon, it is better to be on the inside of the enemy maneuver. Third, one should select the sight in a timely manner (radar, optical) for the developing battle conditions. Fourth, it is necessary to precisely determine the optimal ranges and the moments of missile launch and fire with the cannon, which will depend on the target aspect, nature of its maneuver, and other conditions of the attack. From even a simple enumeration of pilot actions, it is clear that you have to know a lot, and be capable of much in order to fully utilize the capabilities of your weapons for a surprise and swift attack on the adversary, who in turn will undertake everything in order to destroy the fighter or evade a strike. Of course the pilots of all generations wanted to fully utilize the capabilities of their weapons, but they went about it in different ways. It is interesting to have a look at how this was done in the past, and how it is done today. On 12 April 1943, in the skies over Kuban, squadron commander A. Pokryshkin (later on a Marshal of Aviation, a triple hero of the Soviet Union), who was with his squadron in its alert zone, was radioed from the command post the mission of intercepting a group of enemy planes. In order to increase the power-to-weight ratio of their fighters, the pilots while still in expectation of battle, had flown in the zone by the "rocking cradle" or "swinging watch" method: altitude, swift descent over a given region, making it possible to develop high speed, and high speed allowing a rapid gain to the necessary altitude to deliver surprise strikes on the adversary. In addition the battle formation of the squadron was vertically separated with 200-300 m between pairs and 600-800 m between wings. Therefore, at the moment that the intercept mission was received, the squadron had an undoubted advantage in power-to-weight ratio over the adversary, although the tactical performance characteristics of the planes of the sides were roughly equal. In this battle the enemy did not number more than eight planes, and our fighters had no losses. The success of the battle was determined not so much by personal bravery as by the ability of the commander and pilots to ably utilize the capabilities of their weapons. Here the famous Pokryshkin motto, suitable for any battle, was fully evident: "altitude - speed - maneuver - fire," which clearly substantiated the close connection of all elements, determining the degree of realization of the weapon capabilities. Almost a half century later, pilot first class Captain Tsibin took off to intercept an air target, a radio-controlled target. We will compare these two episodes, separated by such a significant interval of time. One occurred at war, the other in the course of tactical flight training. What do they have in common? After all, Tsibin's fighter was far more sophisticated than the fighters from the war years. But upon comparing the episodes, we see that as in a mirror they reflect one and the same ability of the pilots to fully utilize the capabilities of their weapons. The radio-controlled target was still lurking far off somewhere, when Capt. Tsibin received the first commands from the CP: bearing, altitude, weather in the region of action was bad. Lower edge of clouds was 300 m, haze, and the target was protected by jamming, was maneuvering to foil interception on this overcast day. For the target, what was bad visibility, what was, as the pilot's say, a "million by a million," there was no difference. It would cut turns at any G forces, as much as the control surfaces would allow. The operator would not black out; he was on the ground. Tsibin clearly saw the importance and the complexity of executing the mission, and allowed for the maneuver characteristics of his own plane and the target. He knew that whether or not the so-desired target return would appear on his scope, against the jamming background, would depend on his considered maneuver, on the correct handling of the sight. In executing the commands sent to his plane from the CP, and not taking his eyes from the sight scope, Tsibin concentrated his attention on piloting the plane and seeking the target. The "adversary" maneuvered energetically, never ceasing the jamming, but the electronic ring shone with the numbers of the provisional code. The distance to the target diminished swiftly. In the course of several tens of seconds the pilot had to perform numerous necessary actions with the controls of the plane, the sight, and the weapons. Each movement was calculated precisely. The engine rpm, maintenance of the target return on the screen, all was aimed at executing a devastating attack. Before his eyes the signal light flashed, indicating that the pilot had entered the launch zone. Without taking his eyes from the sight, he pushed the launch button, and the missile broke up the thick gloom with the flame of an explosion. The target was destroyed. On the ground they asked Tsibin what he would have done if the target was not destroyed by the missile strike. The pilot answered that in that case he would have immediately switched the armament system to cannon fire immediately after the launch, and prepared it for battle. Like Burnozyan in the remote wartime past, in this flight the officer demonstrated the ability to use his weapons in difficult situations. In those same live fires, one of the pilots was vectored to the target at a difficult aspect angle (the CP crew erred) and another had a defect in his sight (for reasons beyond his control). It occurred to each that the developing situation gave them the right to turn back, but they immediately rejected it: what about accomplishing the mission? The pilots did not lose their heads. Each demonstrated enviable speed of reaction, correctly analyzed the developing situation, and successfully attacked the assigned target. The first using an original maneuver, the second by finding the cause of the failure and using a different operating mode of the sight. Indisputably if the pilots had not known the capabilities of their weapons well, if they had not mastered them to perfection and were not trained, they would not have been ready to perform under these unexpected conditions. There is no need to explain that the more difficult and multifaceted the weapons, the greater the probability of erroneous actions. If there is an inadequately trained pilot in the fighter cockpit, his slightest error or incompetence becomes immediately evident. In those same live fires, after landing, a fighter taxied to the fueling zone with his missiles unfired on their launchers. Everyone wondered why the pilot had not fired. An unexpected equipment failure, unsuccessful guidance from the CP? The officer himself confirmed their doubts. Blaming the jamming, he reported to the commander that he had detected the target a little later than required, so that he had no time to aim. In fact everyone understood that the officer did not have the knowledge and skills to operate the sight under jamming conditions. But here is the interesting part. When I asked the pilot why Captain Tsibin had downed a target under the same conditions, I heard in response: "Just luck. The captain lucked out!" But those who know Tsibin corrected the officer. Behind his flight lay the faultless knowledge of his weapons, and long hard work. Ultimately good luck is very discriminating, it gives its preference only to the worthy. Most likely the officer himself knew this, but he did not want to acknowledge his errors. In his attack of the air target the young pilot developed high speed, did not maintain the set parameters of missile launch, and they went wide of the mark, another in flight acted hastily, was nervous and forgot to turn on one of the weapons switches, so that the launch did not occur at all. The cause was one and the same: both were not adequately trained, both were undone by inept actions with the controls and sight. How then could they maximally utilize the capabilities of their weapons! These errors are especially perceptible if it is not a lone fighter going into battle, but a whole subunit. Do not think, dear reader, that the combat capabilities of the group is the arithmetic sum of the capabilities of the fighters making it up. No, they are greater than this sum, to the extent that the pilots, controlled by the uniform will of the leader, have mastered the tactics of multiple-aircraft air-to-air battle, the ability to build up their general capabilities with high personal proficiency, and to artfully interact in battle. Tactical and fire interaction in the group by far increases its combat might and reduces the possibility of surprise attacks by the adversary, even ruling it out if vigilance is high. I have had occasion to hear the following remark by a young pilot: "What do I have to do as the wingman? You go to the left, look to the right, go to the right, look to the left at the leader. The main thing is not to lose him, not to break up the battle formation, and follow the commands." I would advise the pilot: look at yourself through the prism of combat experience, read the memoirs. It shows there how pilots died when they thought in just that happy-go-lucky fashion. Of course you're not supposed to violate the battle formation. Wartime experience shows that if the wingmen forgot this and abandoned their leaders, got caught up in the chase for individual enemy planes, and even downed them, they badly let down their leaders, and often were themselves shot down. Therefore the initiative and independence of the wingmen is to some extent limited. Let us ask ourselves: in the present-day air-to-air battle, can one fully realize the capabilities of the group's weapons if the wingmen only passively hold their places in the battle formation, if their role does not go beyond the framework of blind copying of the actions of the leader and his planes? No, something else comes to the fore here: the capacity of each pilot to masterfully attack the adversary at any moment at the orders of his commander, to quickly and accurately follow the instructions given to him, to be read to assume responsibility for successful accomplishment of the whole mission. This requires something else entirely: the ability to look at the place occupied in the battle formation not only with one's own eyes, but with the eyes of the leader, to understand one's role in attainment of the ultimate result of battle. And then the wingman will truly "get into" the actions of the group. Narrowness of tactical thinking and lack of initiative will never result in anything good. Each successive generation of fighters acquires better and better tactical performance characteristics, contains in itself elements of fundamental scientific and technical innovation, contains many undiscovered, still-hidden combat capabilities. However there is a serious obstacle on the path to their combat utilization: some characteristics and combat properties of the fighters are already reaching a practical limit, determined not by the qualities of the planes, but by the physical capabilities of the pilots. The new-generation fighters are characterized by G forces which are much greater, and more importantly, have a longer duration and higher rate of buildup. Even trained pilots can withstand high G forces only for a short time, to the detriment of observation of the situation in the course of battle. In addition the growing angular velocities of maneuver result in an overload of the pilot's vestibular apparatus, and he has a very hard time controlling the spatial position of his aircraft during prolonged maneuvering. And at low altitudes, the maximal flight speed becomes higher than that at which it is still possible to safely fly the aircraft and conduct visual orientation in direct proximity to the ground. The difficulties associated with the high of high-performance aircraft naturally are supplemented by the profusion of instrumental data, the increase in the necessary operating speed with the piloting and navigation apparatus, the aircraft control systems and weapons. The capacity to find one's bearings in the numerous dials, instruments and scopes, the attentiveness, memory and other mental and physiological capacities of the pilots also are approaching the limit of human capabilities. And all this in a single-seat fighter, where the pilot is deprived of the assistance of other crew members. He must observe the air space and at the same time look at the instruments. Otherwise, he might not notice when a small red light flashes in the cockpit, indicating say the start of a fire in the engine. In other words, with the expansion of equipment capabilities, battle has become more work-intensive. In a shorter time, it is necessary to perform more actions. This is when the contradiction arises that "The aircraft is capable, the pilot is not." One cannot overlook this contradiction, or underestimate the importance of the problem. How can one reflect about the full utilization of the capabilities of equipment if they are greater than the capabilities of the man? To resolve the problem by improving the skills of known automatism, behind which lay long training sessions, exhausting labor, maximum exertion of strength and will? There is much being said now about the need to resolve this problem. The parameters of the problem exist and are susceptible to accounting, quite precise at that. Valuable statistical material has been accumulated. Nonetheless, research in this field has to this point not brought tangible results. One can definitely say just one thing: the aircraft designers, scientists, all of us have work to do here. Here there is no way to manage without an understanding of how pilots perceive and assimilate information, without a serious, thoughtful approach to development of fundamentally new means of reducing the loads on the human being in executing maneuvers, and display devices to densify the data streams. Aircraft designers strive to reduce to a minimum the harmful influence of G forces on the pilot, to improve the readability of the instruments, to reduce the number of switches. For example, on the prospective American ATF fighter there will be one tenth as many as on present-day fighters, and they will all be located to the side and on the chair of the pilot. The chair tilts to compensate for G forces, and the control stick is to the side, not blocking the view of the instruments. The designers want to ensure constant dosing of data in a volume which is optimal for its assimilation by the pilots, to replace apprising information with command information, which one need not think about, but immediately execute (target selection, method of attack, optimal maneuver). These functions are still not carried out by those low-power airborne automatic control systems which today are installed on planes. In addition they are not always linked: the algorithms of one cannot be understood by another. The pilots understand the need to practice protective muscle and respiratory anti-overload techniques, special training sessions and self-monitoring of one's psycho-physiological state, and react positively to the ideas of reducing the instruments and switches in the cockpit, and to further automation of control, but they want to reserve for themselves the right of choice: when to fly in automatic mode, and when to intervene in this mode, to shift to manual control of the aircraft. Have they paid attention to the width and the multiplicity of the problem? Let us try to analyze and note the ways of resolving it. If we sketch a circuit of tactical and engineer tasks flowing from our discussions, then in it one can distinguish two basic trends in developing of the "airborne brain" or onboard algorithms: - control of the plane and weapons (let us call them the combat algorithms); - development and realization of decisions for the air-to-air battle (these algorithms would logically be called tactical). The combat algorithms, providing the pilot with automated piloting and navigation of the aircraft, optimizing maneuver, control of the zones of surveillance of the sights at launch, lockon of targets, aiming and other such actions, are a task of today which is successfully resolved in fourth-generation fighters. Development of tactical algorithms is a new scientific trend. The issue is expert systems, allow the subunit commanders purposeful perception of data displayed on board the aircraft before and during battle for assessment of the situation and for decision-making. The software may include identification and grouping of air targets, selection of suitable maneuvers, battle formations and weapons type, determination of the expected results of attacks and other calculations. The commander is shown the general situation, including the jamming situation, some supplemental information, and is given recommendations regarding distribution of detected targets among the pilots, and tactical and fire interaction in the group, and then automated command and control of the battle is implemented. Clearly no one need be convinced of the advantages which pilots and commanders will receive in the not so remote future when these wonderful creations will come to life and acquire real sense. There is a hope that even weakly trained pilots will have increased changes of victory in battle. This is why, without combat and tactical algorithms, without expert systems one cannot conceive of the construction of fifth-generation fighters. Preliminary studies, having to do with the feasibility of their development, have been conducted for more than one year now in different countries. There also exist quite realistic developments of "smart weapons." Suffice to say that the above-mentioned ATF fighter is supposed to have 20-30 expert systems, 10-12 of them tactical. However, in order to go from suppositions to reality, one must also allow for another aspect. Today there are still no developed views of the problem as a whole, doubts are expressed concerning the tactical capabilities of its resolution, and differences of opinion remain with regard to approaches toward the practical significance of new algorithms. But some military specialists may ask: Has not the role of the "airborne brain" been exaggerated, is not all this just another fashion, a theory not implemented in practice? To talk of resolving the problem is tantamount to not seeing, or not wanting to see the difficulties and obstacles which are still insuperable, the expenditures for development which are played down. "The plane will become smarter than the pilot if these algorithms are developed," other specialists object. "Is this conceivable?" The doubts are by no means indisputable. They have their own logic. Difficulties and uncertainties cannot be ignored. What does it mean to implement a tactical algorithm in practice? For expert evaluations of target importance, selection of rational tactical techniques, distribution of the fighter forces and many other elements making up the command decision, it is necessary to form a data bank regarding the adversary, friendly fighters and their capabilities, to classify some number of models and tactical situations (they were mentioned in the preceding chapter), and do it separately for close-in and long-range battle, and overcoming of enemy air defenses. And all this is a complex of extremely difficult problems for whose accomplishment it is impossible to propose universal reliable algorithms. But then, development of such intricate algorithms is a special topic, and I would like to return to today, to see the first steps in this field. Let us look at a fourth-generation fighter, for example the Su-27. Just a few years ago hardly anyone could imagine that a commander leading his subordinates into battle in this plane would have an earlier unknown system for controlling them, that on the basis of between-plane radio-telemechanical communications, coming to him from wingmen would be concentrated on the tactical situation scope of his plane, and that he could transmit it to subordinates. You see, such an innovation gives command and control the nature of an ordered target distribution in group air-to-air combat. It remains for us to express our opinion on the thesis that the plane is "smarter" than the pilot. Is that the case? The plane becomes not simply a weapon, but something different, an advisor, an assistant of the pilot. Thus only in combination with further improvement in piloting mastery and tactical proficiency may one fully utilize its high combat capabilities and realize the principle that "the plane can, and the pilot can too." 2. Stratagem Is Also a Weapon Recently I had occasion to be an unwilling participant in the following dialogue between two young pilots. "What do you say about stratagem? They say that it can really save a pilot in battle." "They don't say it -- they used to say it." "We need it, but why?" "I think that our brother fighters in the Great Patriotic War had it better. No ground or airborne radars, the adversary in full ignorance, and full scope for stratagem. I do not remember where I read it, perhaps at military school, that our glorious aces achieved victory by hiding in the sun, clouds, the dark side of the horizon. And now what? Whatever you say, the time of military stratagem is long past." "What do you think? Our commanders says that stratagem is a weapon of the pilot." "No, you listen to me: we live in an era of radar and electronics. Everything is different now. Judge for yourself, do you think you can sneak up on an enemy, with his continuous radar field? And the AWACS system? It will track each of your maneuvers even at low altitude. So how would you employ a stratagem?" "I can't figure it out. So we have only straight-ahead, artless maneuvers? The real air warrior must catch the enemy unawares, force him to submit to a strike." "Fine words, but what do they mean?" "Well, for example, non-standard construction of battle formations, non-standard maneuvers, speed of closure, perhaps also... "Hah! The adversary will discover your plane before you begin maneuvering, before you reach the area of possible attack. Do you think you're dealing with a fool who won't notice, or who will wait for your attack? "You forget about jamming, electronic and fire suppression of enemy radars. "You slipped up here too. Don't you understand, you `tactical giant' that no one will expend manpower and resources specially for your stratagem." "You're a `giant of absurdity' yourself, and your ridicule isn't worth a damn." Let us interrupt this protracted dialogue of the young pilots, the skeptic and the optimist, which almost reached the point of blows. Behind it is not so much youthful fervor as the reflection of a serious problem. One can understand the skeptic, who marshals quite convincing arguments to deny stratagem. To some measure he unfortunately is correct, it is harder to achieve it now. But did the optimists use all the arguments in order to prove the reality of this "weapon" in the modern battle? One need not wax sarcastic here. So what are the capabilities and the field of application of military stratagem in tactics? Can one, and if one can, then how, confuse the adversary, how can one conceal one's true intentions in those unfavorable conditions of which they spoke in the dialogue? In order to respond to these questions and to learn the secrets of military stratagem, there is nothing more convincing or graphic than specific examples. On one tactical air exercise, squadron commander Major S. Grishalev received the mission of clearing the air space and tying down the "enemy" fighters on duty in the zone. The assessment of battle variants began. There were several, but the commander rejected one after another. What was it that hampered him from finding a suitable variant? He knew that the tactical performance characteristics of the planes and the level of training of the pilots of the opposing sides were about the same. The difference lay elsewhere. The squadron had to perform the mission over "enemy" territory, his ground radars monitored the situation, while the friendly fighters were unable to obtain target designation from the CP. After weighing his own and the "enemy's" capabilities, the commander concluded that the squadron's chances of beating or even simply tying down the fighters in the zone for a long time were minimal, and the losses might turn out to be quite heavy. Here it was simply necessary to develop an unusual, daring, even risky variant which would make it possible to confuse the adversary and achieve success. In order to confuse the adversary, there are two evident variants: use of very low altitudes, and the jamming of enemy radars. But for fighters these variants are not very suitable -- they do not select the flight altitude, which depends on the alert altitude of the fighters of the "adversary," and they do not have powerful EW apparatus. Here one can count only on other tactical techniques. After thinking it over to the extent that time permitted, the commander adopted a non-standard decision: to break up the battle formation of the squadron, and separate a flight from it which was to proceed at a much higher altitude than the main group. Of course the squadron commander foresaw the puzzled glances of his subordinates (instead of massing efforts of the fighters for the decisive first attack, he, the commander for some reason was dispersing them), but the results of calculations, which the commander was convinced were correct, favored the decision. That is what happened. When the squadron reached the battle region, the "adversary" did not notice the main group, since he was occupied by the flight, which was earlier detected by his radar, and about which he received target designation from his CP. In performing the functions of a decoy element, the flight did everything to be noticed. From the energetic offensive maneuver which the "adversary" carried out, it became clear that the commander's plan was realized and the battle unfolded in accordance with it. Acting deliberately, without camouflage and concealment, the "decoys" were able to draw the "adversary" under the strike of the main group and assured its covertness of closure and attack. The effect exceeded all expectations. Tied down by these actions, the commander of the attacked group did not have time to get his bearings in time, and issue commands to the wingmen. The battle formation and the tactical coordination in the group was disrupted, and it was impossible to restore it in the course of the battle. The technique was risky (if the "adversary" had figured out the plan of the fighters, they would have been destroyed in detail) but it was effective under the conditions when it seemed that even to think of covertness of action would have been naive. After the exercise, the pilots of the opposing side blamed everything on the CP crew, which had not noticed the assault element, but they also did not hide the fact that they are not confronted by stratagem all that often in their routine training. They said they expected standard actions, and then, all at once, there was another element. And the fighters did not operate "by the rules," which also caused confusion. Well, it is true that there is fertile ground for such arguments. Perhaps, precisely because the skeptical pilot, with a persistence worthy of a better application, convinced his comrade that stratagem had died away? Another example. An assault group of bombers, escorted by fighters, had the mission of delivering a strike on an objective which was of great importance. Successfully repelling the attacks of the fighters of the defending side, it fought its way stubbornly to the target. Then the commander directing the actions of the fighters from the CP scrambled three separate elements to intercept it. Two of them were weak in numbers, and, not concealing their intentions, they created a threat of enemy attack simultaneously from two directions, and drew the fighter protection toward them. But the third, the main force, attacked the bombers unhindered, and, using the confusion of the "adversary," they delivered a devastating strike. Stratagem again saved the pilots. It remains for us to look at the place of stratagem in the very critical situation of battle, when, it would appear, there is nothing that can be done except witness one's defeat. A fighter flight, according to the received mission, was penetrating "enemy" territory. As in the first example, the pilots realized that they were under direct surveillance of his radar, and that they could not count on the help of their CP. They were still conducting a search, the screens of the onboard radar sights were still clear, and there were no returns on them, when suddenly they heard in the earphones: "I see a target. I am attacking!" These familiar words were uttered not by the flight commander Captain I. Shaklin or by his subordinates. When the captain heard them, he looked in his periscope and saw enemy fighters in the aft hemisphere. Their tactical advantage appeared indisputable, the defeat inevitable. In order to somehow evade the strike, the flight began a turn at maximum G force, but the fighters raced after them. Their leader resolutely constructed the maneuver, and probably was already counting down the last seconds before commencing fire. Here it is, a moment when only something unexpected can foil the attack. But what was to be done? In this critical situation, in order to change the position of the sides, Shaklin decided to try a stratagem. A brief command and all the pilots reduced their G forces for several seconds. The adversary could have engaged them without hindrance if he had foreseen the possibility of such an illogical action. But he was already convinced that the attacked planes would seek to escape from their pursuers only through maximum G forces, and therefore, without guessing Shaklin's plan, he put his foot in it, so to speak. In contrast to the "adversary," the flight commander controlled the situation and recalled that he had mere seconds to seize the initiative. When the planes had gained the necessary velocity reserve, he put the element into an energetic turn. The picture of the battle changed sharply. Maneuver, another maneuver... Now the rivals were on equal terms. The stratagem succeeded, and the outcome of the battle was now a matter of technique. Let us now move on from individual episodes to broader generalities. Despite all the variety of tactical situations, let us try to formulate a general concept of "stratagem." It may be understood as those actions of pilots and CP crews which distract the attention of the adversary, create an incorrect idea of the situation in him, and thus deprive him of the opportunity to realize his plan and leads to the adoption of erroneous or late decisions. Stratagem should be considered successful if the adversary cannot guess it and take countermeasures before the fighters attack him. The more unclear and difficult the situation for the adversary, the longer the action of military stratagem will last. So what promoted the attainment of stratagem in the three described episodes? I believe that the determining conditions of success were in the tactical and piloting proficiency of the commander and all the pilots. Much depended on how creatively they were able to use unusual, surprise techniques, how they were able to force their will on the adversary in performance of tactical missions. But if we look into these three small episodes, we can see that they mirror the basic components of stratagem. Let us try to formulate them. First of all, it is necessary to act the way that the adversary least expects, i.e., to create situations for which he is unprepared. To catch the adversary unprepared for retaliatory actions means to force him to abandon earlier decisions and to make new ones. Such decisions, adopted hurriedly, without adequate calculation and soundness, will correspond less to the changing situation and may lead the adversary to defeat. But this requires one to play some sort of "surprise" on him, to use a tactical technique which is capable of stunning the enemy, to create a false idea of one's intentions, to confront him with the need to react to our actions by the laws of logic known only to us. Persistence, initiative, and even daring in combination with able use of weapons and precise interaction within an element and between elements will make it possible to muddle the adversary's plan of battle and draw him into a trap. Second, exceptional speed of action is required. A stratagem retains its force until the surprised adversary figures out, if he can, the plan of the fighters and begins to counter them. To hit the enemy before he realizes he is being attacked means to beat him to the punch in maneuver, to be the first one to accelerate one's plane, to gain altitude or descend in order to assure oneself the conditions for a surprise attack, to appear unexpectedly in a convenient fire position and immediately use one's weapons. Third, a readiness to undertake risk is needed. A stratagem is always associated with it, and he who knows how to take a well-founded risk gains greater advantages in battle. When an exceptionally hard and solitary chance will lead to victory, one must resolve to take it. Of course risk by its nature is not safe. While the need for it is obvious in a military battle with a real enemy, in training flights where the adversary is just hypothetical it is very difficult to determine its acceptable limits. This is a subtle matter. There is not, there cannot be, an instrument which could objectively measure such limits, where stratagem does not contradict the rules of flight safety. It would seem that not so many intricacies must be allowed for in order to learn stratagem. But stratagem is not impromptu, although at times you can't get by without it. When I asked Shaklin how he managed to react so quickly to a critical situation, and so nimbly evade the strike, he got a large album and mutely handed it to me. Paging through it, I saw carefully devised variants of fighter battles, corroborated by the results of modelling. Also in the album (albeit in general features) was the variant by which the flight operated. "Well fine," one reader might say. "So it is just a matter of thoroughly studying all components of stratagem ahead of time, to stock up on its variants, and its attainment will be assured?" "No," I respond. "It will not be assured, even if all components are allowed for." Judge for yourselves. A squadron was given the mission of destroying an early-warning aircraft in the depth of the adversary's territory. The pilots had already accomplished such a mission in past tactical exercise. At that time, thanks to an original combination of decoy actions with an encirclement maneuver, they managed to disorient the adversary's fighter protection and draw the early-warning plane into a trap. The stratagem of the pilots, their surprise attack on the target, were especially noted by a senior officer at the exercise critique. But now, when the squadron again used its experience, it fell into a trap itself. The "adversary" was on the alert. This is why the above components may be considered only general rules of stratagem. It must also be original. Ask any pilot having in his reserve a very great number of tactical techniques, does he have occasion to use the identical "traps" in ready-made form. I am certain that you will receive a negative answer. Do you think such a thing would be appropriate in tactics, which by its nature does not brook cliche? Clearly any tactical technique may quickly exhaust itself if it is used repeatedly in accordance with an established scheme, which sooner or later will be uncovered by the adversary. Thus stratagem is a multifaceted concept, a less painful path to victory. Today it is used differently than in the past, when the opposing sides did not have widespread radar detection systems, but even today there are not and cannot be stereotypes, for this would contradict the very essence of stratagem. One must know how to vary different combinations of tactical techniques in accordance with all the diversity of conditions. 3. Do You Know How To Make Seconds Count? A tactical flight exercise was under way. Many tens of kilometers from the CP an event was under way in the sky which called commitment of fighters to battle. The planes took off pair after pair. The commander, following the scrambling of the fighters with his watch, smiled: the pilots had exceeded the standards. He did not imagine at that moment how soon he himself and, even more so, his subordinates would require this quality, the ability to make seconds count. Some time later, when the commander glanced at the plotting board, he immediately grew alarmed: one of the air targets moving to one side, to which he had initially not paid attention, had suddenly changed course and begun to approach an important installation. From the rapid shifting of the target return on the board, it was not hard to determine that it was going at high speed. There was not a second to spare. The commander was well aware that in the developing situation everything depended on speed of action. But how was he to gain time, how could he beat the adversary to the objective? There was no time left to scramble fighters from the airfield. In his search for an acceptable solution, he again looked at the board. A pair of fighters proceeding to intercept another pair, which was still at a significant distance from the designated perimeter, was the closest to the dangerous target. Assessing the possibilities of intercept of this target by the other fighters, and convinced of its feasibility, the commander decided to retarget the pair at the new target. This decision made itself, as it were, but behind it lay the hard thinking of the commander, speed of calculation, recalculation of perimeters, flight modes of the fighters, and precise control of the fighters in the air. The pair leader, receiving the new mission from the CP, realized that lost seconds in the flight to the target would be practically irretrievable. Thus the fighters had to reach the attack line in an extremely short time, but this was not all. It was possible to quickly detect the target, but not draw any tactical advantage from this, if the position assumed in the search and the battle formation of the pair did not allow immediate closure. And in the lost seconds the adversary would deliver a strike. The leader decided to go for the target at maximum permissible speed and with an increased interval between the planes in the pair to attack the adversary even if the wingman lagged behind. In this case the calculation was sound: it allowed the possibility of accomplishing the attack by one of the fighters in the shortest time, and also of building up forces if the adversary were to maneuver. Now the target was detected and identified, but its objective was also nearly at hand. The adversary, upon detecting the fighters, began to maneuver energetically and put the pair leader in a difficult situation. There followed an energetic counter-maneuver of the wingman who was lagging somewhat behind, precise aiming, and the target was destroyed when they were just a few seconds from the objective. The attack was fast-moving, and as the data of the flight recording equipment confirmed, it was precise. This is what it means to make seconds count. There is a good reason why pilots joke that time is like air. When its there, no one notices it, and when its not there, everybody suffocates. There is no question, in situations characterized by an urgent time shortage, it is not always easy to perform. There are times when the very best decision may prove useless, when it is made late, and the most clever tactical techniques will not bring success if they are made too late. But it goes without saying that a time limitation cannot serve as justification for tardy actions and miscalculations in battle. If a commander is tardy in assessing the situation, is slow in issuing the battle order, if the pilots are late in scrambling or display a lack of resolve upon detecting the target, the result is the same: a well thought-out battle may end in failure. The time element has always played a role in tactics, and fighters also were confronted with time shortages back in the Great Patriotic War. The success went to those who valued and knew how to use time. At Kursk, this was 12 July 1943, a squadron of Yak-9s was protecting our troops. Eighteen fascist Heinkel-111 bombers appeared very high above the fighters, and even higher a group of Messerschmidts covering them. Neither the correlation of forces nor the relative disposition of friendly and enemy planes favored joining battle. What was to be done? The squadron commander decided to attack the bombers, not straight on, but first to gain altitude, get a little closer, assume a tactically favorable position for battle, and hit the adversary when he was more certain of success. Well, of course, this decision was well founded. But the commander lost sight of one important circumstance: the bombers were already approaching our forward edge, and he could not know what terrible danger their bombs posed to our troops. To gain altitude and execute a protracted maneuver meant to lose time, during which the irretrievable could occur: the enemy would have time to deliver a strike before the fighters attacked him. Major F. Gnezdilov took another way. That same day he found himself in a similar, but more complex, situation. He was leading eight Yaks which encountered 36 Heinkels, also protected by fighters. Of course, all of the pilots expected to meet the adversary, but none expected such a large group. However the commander well knew the value of time: the most important thing was not to allow the fighters to drop their bombs on the protected troops. He headed one flight right at the enemy fighters, and the other at his command went into a steep dive, and using their great velocity reserve, broke swiftly into the battle formation of the bombers. Crimson tongs of flame and tails of brown smoke immediately extended behind three planes. While the enemy in confusion tried to figure out what was happening, the Yaks leapt through the Heinkel formation and again attacked them, now head to head. Again two enemy planes began to smoke. And then the battle formation of the enormous armada fell apart. The fascists dropped their load hastily, wherever it might land, and hastened to retreat. I am taking a long time to speak of these precious seconds, but there, in the air battles, they were much shorter. The error of the commander who does not know the value of time is unforgivable, and all praise goes to the bold but calculating decisions which do not allow delays which the adversary might use. But let us return to today. Imagine for a minute that you are in the cockpit of a MiG-26 fighter, and are leading a group to air-to-air combat, and hunched over your sight you await the appearance of a target. Now say, how much time will you have to make a battle decision, once you detect a target, in comparison with the past? In seeking an answer to this question, you will think of the high speeds and rate of climb of your fighters, and of course will not forget the suspended all-aspect missiles which do not require long closure with the adversary and which can destroy him at long distance. The easiest answer: the time to make a decision has decreased immeasurably. Who can deny it? But can one measure this "immeasurable time"? But then, judge yourself, let us count the seconds, which sometimes are more eloquent than words. Let us estimate the approximate distribution of time for all actions of pilots of average proficiency after detection of the adversary (fig. 39). It is clear from the figure that the total time which the fighters have before missile launch is around 50-60 seconds. But what time remains to the element commander to make a decision (tp, ts, and tr)? I believe that the meaning of this requires no comment. This time can scarcely be increased, as it is impossible to restrict the speed of the attack. Figure 39. Time characteristics of attack on a headon course. Probably this interpretation will not suit many. That may be the case, the experienced reader will argue, but why look at the work of the commander only in the most difficult conditions, when closing with an adversary head-to-head? Let us take such doubts seriously, and now analyze the time characteristics of command functions under other conditions. At first glance everything is much easier. Let us assume that a flight commander, vectored by the control center to the rear hemisphere of the target, sees a group of eight aircraft ahead of him. Upon detecting our fighters, it executes an unexpected maneuver (fig. 40, I). Assuming that the tactical performance characteristics of the planes of the opposing sides are equal in the majority of components, let us analyze the distribution of time expenditures in this case. Figure 40. Capabilities of executing the decision of a flight commander in terms of time pair, must push the button of the transmitter and say a Here the tactics are obvious. In the prevailing situation, the flight must either attack one of the separating groups with the entire complement, or, more favorably, both groups with pairs, despite the numerical advantage of the adversary (fig. 40, II). Then both groups would be tied down in battle, and the initiative would be with our fighters. Let us return to dry but objective figures. After making the battle decision in the same time as in the preceding example, the flight commander, in order to transmit his command to the other pair, must push the button of the transmitter and say a minimum of five or six words ("Attack left element, right target is yours.") -- four or five seconds. How much time is then required of the leader of the second pair in order to understand the command and begin the maneuver? By the most modest calculations, 10-12 seconds will be expended. In this time the adversary will turn to meet the fighters or go beyond the limits of visibility. We are limiting ourselves to a small fragment of the battle in order to demonstrate all the complexity of fighting for every second. How many such consecutive fragments confront the commander with the threat of a negative balance of time! This very important conclusion, at first glance even paradoxical, is completely legitimate. The significance, effectiveness and practical feasibility of tactical techniques are more and more determined by the time factor, and this must not be underestimated. One must deal with reality, and it is truly worth thinking about and, after thinking, seeking the paths of further tactical development. However, the ability to make seconds count in an air battle is only one of the aspects of the time factor. Another no less important is the struggle for seconds in the organization of the fighter sortie and their commitment to battle. Here radar subunits have detected the adversary in the air. The first routes of the air targets have appeared on the plotting boards of the CP, and the competition to win time has begun between the opposing sides. Who then will win? This estimate can be made if one compares the flight time of the adversary (Tf), the time he takes to fly to the point of engagement of the fighters (RVB) with the time spent on commitment (Tvv). It goes without saying that the time spent on the commitment to battle must be less or at last equal to the flight time of the adversary. This condition (fig. 41) may be formulated in the form of the following expression: Tvv less than Tf The flight time of the adversary has a special meaning. Essentially it is the time resource which the adversary "gives" to the fighters to repel the raid. In order to calculate the flight time, one must know the range of detection of the adversary by ground radars, or by airborne early warning complexes at various altitudes, and their location relative to the point of engagement d. The obtained distance between the perimeters of detection and commitment of the fighters, divided by the speed of the adversary, gives his flight time (fig. 41). Figure 41. Conditions for timely commitment of fighters to battle, Another reader might think that the flight time does not depend on our actions. The adversary himself will chose the appropriate altitudes and flight speeds for himself, and the location of the radars is determined by the senior officer. This is not so. The flight time may be increased, especially under conditions of a difficult jamming situation, by using the information of all types of reconnaissance capable of detecting the scrambling of enemy aviation from their airfields and tracking their flight until entry into the radar zones, and also by speeding up the receipt and display of data regarding the air situation. Let us track the route of information about the adversary from his detection until the commander's reaction to it. The main suppliers of information about the air situation remain for the present the radar subunits, which transmit it to the higher CP, where data are synthesized and systematized, and then go to the CPs of the aviation units. It would seem that everything is smooth and simple, by how much time do these manipulations require? In this time the adversary will have time to cover many tens of kilometers. Information from the higher CP lags constantly. If the commander wants to increase the flight time of the adversary, he must try to obtain fresher data from the radar subunit with which he is directly coordinating, and to involve the fighters themselves, performing missions over enemy territory, in reconnaissance of air targets. Now let us turn to the second component of the above inequality -- the time required for commitment of fighters to battle (Tvv). As is clear from figure 41, this time consists of the time spent by the commander to adopt a decision (tr), transmit the command to the fighters for sortie (tk), their preparation (tp), takeoff (tt) and assembly in battle formation (ts), fight to the attack line (tb) and for maneuver for the start of battle (tm). The sum of the indicated times is the total time (Tvv). Of course a negative difference between them and the flight time of the adversary, as in the air-to-air battle, is unacceptable. There are many ways of shortening the time of commitment of the fighters to battle. All categories of personnel participate in seeking and implementing these ways. Let us begin with the commander. He must make the battle decision. Whether this decision is formulated in written form with all specifics, or is concentrated in just a few phrases, it is always made in accordance with a specific algorithm. Let us again examine that familiar chain of actions which the commander's thought runs through: clarification of the mission, estimation of the situation, the decision, formulation of the decision, assignment of tasks to subordinates... The commander is completely familiar with the working procedures of this logical algorithm. So why would he go slow in searching for a rational decision, even when he knows the negative consequences of tardiness? Let us try to enter into his position. A great volume of data, and non-specificity of the situation, multiplicity of alternative situations and variants of battle, and along with this an urgent time shortage, which does not fit into the customary framework of the recent past, these are the reasons. Much has been written about this, so there is no need to repeat it. In battle there should not be any long-winded instructions, verbose reports, or a profusion of eloquent documents. And if the time shortage is so urgent that there is no time at all for clarification of the mission, estimate of the situation, and other components of the process of developing the decision, what then? That also happens. Events in the air develop more and more quickly and unexpectedly. Therefore it is often necessary to run a risk, relying only on one's personal experience and foresight. The commander must react instantaneously to suddenly arising threats. It seems to me that under such conditions one must change the program of decision-making and that a more flexible algorithm, developed on the principle of "If I do not know what to do, then I will do this..." would not be out of place. Sure, a "daring" decision made by such an algorithm will be risky, and not entirely correct under the conditions of the specific situation, but that is better than a late decision which cannot be implemented at all, or simple passive waiting for the outcome. An algorithm for such situations may be the most simple, and then subsequently with clarification of the situation can always be modified. In corroboration of this, I will site one instructive example. The adversary managed to organize a raid on an airfield where fighters were based in such a way that the commander learned too late of their approach. The advantages of the attacker are well known. He has the initiative in the choice of method and time of delivery of the strike, in order to put the defenders in an unfavorable position. What was to be done. Perhaps, proceeding from the strict logic of the "classical" algorithm, to make a sound decision to repel the raid? But the threat of the strike was too evident, and the commander immediately issued the command to scramble the alert subunit to protect the airfield. What did he hope for in making this unconsidered decision? Of course, the takeoff of such small forces did not allow him to prevent the strike, but the commander assumed that just their presence in the region of the airfield would lower the effectiveness of the strike and give additional time to clarify the decision. And that is what happened. The duty subunit immediately after takeoff attacked the first element of enemy planes already appearing over the airfield, which did not have the strength to hinder the beginning scramble of the main forces. Under its protection the fighters took off pair by pair and immediately joined battle. And the strike on the airfield did not take place after all. Strictly speaking, it would be incorrect to call the commander's decision unconsidered. An estimate of the situation, albeit very brief, had preceded it. Of course the officer reckoned that the time was clearly inadequate to scramble all forces to evade the strike, and he allowed for the fact that it was also not advisable to wait out the strike on the airfield, because the fighters at this time were not in their shelters. However his decision was based solely on personal experience. He understood also that the takeoff of the duty subunit to meet the adversary was associated with a well-known risk, taking off under fire. Thus what conclusion can be drawn from this episode? That this was the victory of experience and foresight over the traditional algorithm. Perhaps the considered algorithm is not indisputable. After all they say with good reasons that truth is born in controversy and experience. Arguments and discussions occur in order that different opinions be expressed, and so that the reader may draw his own conclusions and look for the truth. Now let us turn the conversion from the intellectual sphere, so to speak, to the material sphere -- preparation for combat flight of the aircraft and armament. The significant time expenditures in this sphere, which restrain the timely commitment of the fighters to battle, are no secret to anyone. Complicated aviation complexes, which require strict and punctual accomplishment of many operations of maintenance and work in accordance with rigid schedules, have still not fully stimulated a reduction in the turn-around times of fighters. Much time is needed to find the causes of failures, and correct various defects. And this is done under conditions when the slightest omission in preparation of the planes and the equipment mounted on them, which are based on electronics, may be catastrophic in battle. One is somewhat reassured, and some hopes are raised, by the technical ways of satisfying the requirements of tactics for minimal volume and minimal time of technical maintenance (they were mentioned in chapter II), but again, seconds are growing "shorter and shorter." And this means that such well known requirements as constant maintenance of the aviation equipment in excellent condition, a high level of proficiency and personal responsibility of each specialist maintaining the equipment and arms, team-work in the actions of all the engineer and technical staff, and high technical culture remain in force, and continue to retain their importance. The fight for time also makes a vital impression on the actions of flight personnel. I will not tire the reader with a recitation of the whole group of well-known measures which speed up the processes of fighter sorties, beginning with engine start and taxiing to the takeoff points. However situations which arise here at times give grounds for gloomy thoughts. Once during a training alert I watched a plane taxi out onto the runway, guided by a young pilot. This time he performed in terrible haste, forgetting safety measures. He exceeded the taxi speed and made some sharp turns, causing a breakdown on the plane. He had to return to the parking area. Does one have to prove that hastiness of pilots in reports, their distortion in comparison with the established form, may lead to repeated questions from the CP, and even to incorrect commands if these reports are misunderstood? Many "excess" seconds are spent in correcting errors. Haste and bustle, in which the probability of errors and blunders grows, are poor assistants to the pilots. This would seem to be an evident truth, but can one believe that everything is clear here? Look at another commander, who in training sessions is interested first of all in reducing the times of working operations of pilots with cockpit equipment, and you will see that speed of action proliferates into haste, into numerous errors. How to more quickly prepare for a sortie, to take off with minimal acceptable intervals between pairs, to reach the point of engagement at maximum possible speed, all these are untapped reserves of time, so necessary in battle, and open for discovery. The old tested method of "trial and error" is inappropriate here -- there is too little time for "trials," and the "errors" might prove too costly. How important, in the struggle for time, is the ability of the commander himself to make precious seconds count, to make rapid and correct decisions in difficult, critical situations! But speed of actions is good when it is precisely measured. Thus the struggle of time indisputably rules out all haste, not speed and alacrity. These are precisely the necessary qualities, while haste is the absence of patience and self-control, which is a kind of laziness of thought, prompting one to quit the heavy work of assessing the situation when the possibility of decision-making is just taking shape, to speed up one action or another without need. Remember the familiar saying "make haste slowly" and consider whether we sometimes try to save seconds too easily or too arbitrarily. Look at how you, the reader, would make decisions at the CP or in a training battle. Seconds lost in the estimate of the situation, in hearing the reports of specialists, the long seconds of pondering under the conditions of high-speed attacks... Think of the ultimate result of all this, and what advantages could be acquired if one truly learns to make seconds count. * * * The aspects of the air-to-air battle are multifaceted, and not all of them have been reflected here even briefly. In any battle, in order to achieve victory and avoid defeat in unfavorable situations, pilots must know how to use every capability of their weapons, how to outsmart the enemy, and to use time economically. However victory in battle goes not only to the pilots who personally attack the enemy, but also to those who direct the battle. Of course their participation is less noticeable, their contribution to victory less visible, and at times they are mentioned just in passing, but the demands put on them are no less, and first of all on the commander of the CP crew. Chapter VII. How to Conduct Tactical Command and Control 1. Knowledge and Capabilities Required of the Commander What are the activities of the commander at the CP? In order to respond to that, perhaps naive, question we transport ourselves mentally to the command post at, what is for us, the most interesting moment in the warding off of an "enemy" raid. The room is in semi-darkness. The weak light of the signal boards and indicators illuminates the shelves and tables holding the equipment and the concentrated faces of the specialists of the CP detail. Our glance lingers on the large vertical plotting board where the air conditions are depicted. The work of the CP team appears very humdrum when viewed by an outsider. The CP receives continuous information concerning the situation in the air from the forward radar posts and from other sources. Here this information is processed and analyzed and from here the fighters in the air receive guidance. Those monitoring the plotting boards and those operating the equipment tirelessly track the air targets and their fighters. Here radio operators are providing uninterrupted communications. Officers directing the combat, riveted to their instruments, guide the fighters onto the targets, give the necessary commands to bring the aircraft into a tactically advantageous position as combat is initiated, render assistance in maintaining battle order, support tactical cooperation and flight safety. Behind sound-proof glass the officers, who maintain constant communications with the cooperating units supporting the subunits, transmit and receive the necessary information. Periodically the commander looks at the vertical plotting board and its indicator, listens to the specialists' reports; from time to time he talks on the telephone, gives brief instructions over the loud speaker and even briefer instructions over the radio: "9-49, attack target!". To an outsider it would seem that the commander is not working as hard as the others. However, that is not the case. The CP team has no superfluous jobs, and the commander's job is particularly important. One is reminded of the days gone by on the front. There were all kinds of commanders back then. There were those who "fought" primarily at the command post and with signal flags in their hands on the airfield. They themselves did not fly combat missions, had no understanding of how their pilots fought, didn't know how to conduct themselves in an air battle, didn't know who was worth something and who could be trusted with what. Must one be reminded of the irrefutable advantage a commander obtains when he instructs and trains his own pilots, acting as a role model. "Example is stronger than rules," "knowledge teaches, example attracts," "a good example is better than advice" -- these are popular old sayings. The wisdom of such sayings is obvious. Nothing inspires one to great deeds, nothing persuades one like the example of a commander. Therefore, if a commander wants to have capable air fighters, he himself leads them into battle. However, at the same time we must not forget that the commander is, above all, a tactician, a combat organizer, who spends the greater part of his time at the CP where he has a better perspective on the situation than the pilot in the air now that radar information has become more accurate and more timely than in the not-too-distant past. Of course, the nature of management has also changed. Under the influence of new aircraft technology and armaments, the processes and functions of management have been accelerated, and while their form has not changed, they have acquired a new quality. They have become more complex. It is generally known that without a commander no decisions are made, the technology is useless, and the people don't work. But I can't help but mention something else. In his head the commander holds a vast array of instructions, numerical data, and other information necessary for combat management. However, no matter how great the resources of human memory may be, they are, nevertheless, limited. If these resources are used recklessly, then, for all the effort, not only will you not achieve the necessary effect, but the result will be negative. I am reminded of one such incident. Lieutenant colonel N. arrived at one of the aviation units from the Air Force Academy after completing his studies. He worked hard mastering his duties as commander. Superiors and colleagues who had spoken with him remarked that the officer was exceedingly well-versed in many spheres of operational-tactical and military technical knowledge. But then during one of the exercises a critical situation developed and it required that command and control of the fighters be transferred quickly to another CP. In order to do this the lieutenant colonel should have sent the tactical command and control officer the necessary information. And then it became clear that this man, who had appeared so comprehensively trained, didn't remember the very thing that he should have known by heart: the actual data concerning the capabilities of the fighters and of their command and control means. Afterwards, the officer lamented: "It was some kind of a delusion, they say -- I knew everything, and then when I needed it, I forgot it." Of course, it wasn't a matter of delusion. The man simply lost his head in the flood of information which came pouring down on him, and he forgot the most important thing he needed to know in the actual situation. What knowledge and capabilities then should the commander at the CP possess? This question must be answered in the most specific terms of the commander's activities. When making decisions, the commander usually listens to his aides and specialists, and, if time allows, he might consult his instructions, reference books, or various text books; often it is simply necessary to do more than that. The commander's head is not like the memory unit of a computer. Therefore, the ability to quickly work with a number of documents, to find the necessary information and answers to the questions put to him are as essential to the commander as the information which he should know by heart. A more complicated matter giving rise to a mass of contradictory opinions is that concerning what volume of essential information the commander should possess. Should he know the enemy? "What a question!", exclaims the reader, "It is even clear to a civilian that without knowledge of the enemy you can't entertain the thought of conducting battle with him." Yes, any commander should know the enemy, but to what degree, within what limits? Obviously it is not as important for the commander to keep in mind the composition and disposition of the aviation in the theater of operations, but it is vitally important to remember and to thoroughly know the combat capabilities of the various groups of enemy aircraft and the enemy's tactical ruses, because otherwise it is not possible to make decisions and revise them in the course of battle. But to what degree is it necessary to be familiar with the command and control means? The commander now has many complicated and precise combat control levers concentrated in his hands. At his disposal are powerful means of communication, ground radar stations, the range of which is greater than the fighters' onboard sighting devices, automated systems and other very new electronic innovations. Obviously, the high degree of effectiveness of all this equipment at the commander's disposal depends on the reality of whether he has a perfect command of them. Sometimes they say, referring to one commander or another: He knows the control means "down to the nuts and bolts." This testimonial is, without a doubt, flattering. However, is such a degree of knowledge required today? It appears that along with the usual professional knowledge, gaining more and more importance today is that knowledge which embraces the general principles of the control systems, their functional interdependence and capabilities under the actual conditions of the situation. In other words, the commander should have an irreproachable knowledge of what tasks can be carried out by the command and control means, what they will deliver to the commander, what estimates, how fast, and with what degree of reliability they can be performed, what variations of their usage in what tactical situations, when there are partial damages, and how much time is required to correct them. At the same time, it doesn't seem so bad if the commander isn't capable of performing calculations for an interception like a navigator, but he needs to assimilate the navigator's general principles in order that he avoid giving orders back to his command and control officers which he knows cannot be fulfilled and in order that he intelligently conduct tactical command and control. And still, tactical mastery, i.e., the ability to conduct tactical command and control, seems to be the finishing touch to a commander's professionalism. Possessing a high degree of personal training, he should concentrate his managerial work on implementing plans, creating the most favorable conditions possible for those subordinate to the commanders and for the pilots to fulfill their assigned combat missions. In the past few years much has changed in the activities of the commander at the CP. The technical command and control means -- "the commander's tactical aids" reflect the situation more completely and swiftly, automatize necessary calculations, but more and more often without warning they burst into the CP making management of the conditions more complicated. At the most inappropriate moment radio communications with the fighters which have just taken off are interrupted by the enemy, the screens are filled with interference, it becomes more and more difficult to identify the target blips. Here the commander has to manage under conditions where there is not enough information. But this means that he should be able to imagine the development of the air conditions and the position of his own aircraft in relation to those of the enemy not only based on the representations of the plotting board and the indicators, but also based on the results of calculations, the pilots' messages, and information arriving from other sources. He must know the possible ranges of changes in speed employed by the fighters in executing maneuvers; he must take into consideration the functional condition of the pilots, their degree of combat fatigue, and, finally, he must be able to imbue them with confidence and decisiveness, and to guarantee flight safety. You can make list after list of everything that a commander should know, be capable of, and take into consideration when conducting tactical command and control. For example, the position of the sun and of cumulus clouds when the fighters are committing to combat. These sources of powerful thermal radiation, if they are not taken into consideration, will undoubtedly have an adverse impact on the effectiveness of the attack when the pilot launches heat-seeking missiles. But it would be irrational and illogical for the commander to strive to make all the decisions for his pilots, to substitute petty guardianship for their decisions by constantly meddling in their actions. Such a style of leadership, giving rise to a surplus of energy and self-importance, not only infringes on the subordinates' right to initiative, but spares them their responsibilities. What, then, is the upshot of these discussions? The range of knowledge and skills required of a CP commander is unusually broad. In addition, as they say in the manual, he is the immediate organizer of combat and political training, he is responsible for combat readiness, discipline, and the moral-political state of the personnel. Much strength and energy is required of the commander to carry out his daily activities of training and instructing his subordinates and managing his administrative and support affairs. There are many other facets in the "chief - subordinate" sub-system which is an integral part of any military system. All of this must be supported, merged, and kept under control in the proper manner. But from this point it follows that for the time being the CP commander should be spared unessential information, as we mentioned earlier, and he should be given the opportunity to assimilate precisely that knowledge and those skills that he will really need. One should never forget that when determining the final aims of commander training. Heterogeneous knowledge and skills (administrative, navigational, engineering) should give way to tactical interpretation applicable to the actual command and control functions of a commander. Finally, there is one more group of circumstances without which there would be no commander. More than anyone else, the commander, if you will, must possess confidence, self-control, and a sense of responsibility for his decisions and actions. Every thought invested with the commander's great power and formed into a laconic combat order is very crucial because it brings many people and combat equipment into action. And if the commander is indecisive, isn't he incapable of taking the entire responsibility for fulfilling the combat mission? It doesn't make sense to divide the responsibility, bit by bit, among everyone. In the final analysis the result would be that nobody would actually carry the responsibility. One commander foreseeing an "enemy" raid makes the decision to put fighters into the air in advance and does so, while another commander waits to see how the neighboring command post will act and waits for instructions from higher up. As a result the first takes full advantage of the opportunity to intercept the "enemy" on distant borders, while the second commander has significantly less opportunity to achieve this even though the aircraft in both cases are exactly the same. And so, what does the commander do at the CP? Guided by the pre-planned scenarios and the training of the members of the CP team, he manages battle. Together with his team the commander tries to figure out the "enemy's" intentions; he sends up fighters and brings them to the point of engagement. It is difficult for the pilots themselves, and not always possible for them to determine a tactically advantageous position for attacking targets, to independently execute a maneuver when drawing close to the enemy, to take countermeasures in the face of the "enemy's" reciprocal attacks, to continuously observe the actions of their comrades in battle. Therefore, using the local and weather conditions, the commander and his aids secretively bring the fighters to the "enemy," help them to forestall the enemy through their actions, and to confuse the enemy as to their intentions, prompt them as to what maneuver they should use to initiate combat, from what direction they should expect an enemy attack, how to escape a strike, and thereby create favorable conditions for setting up for an engagement. But then the group leaders report to the command post: "I see the target, I'm attacking." The battle has begun. The commander knows that if the battle disintegrates into uncoordinated dogfights of the fighters with the "enemy," it will hardly be possible to achieve great results. Therefore, when executing command and control he strives to create an advantageous correlation of forces, to coordinate reciprocal actions between the groups of different tactical designations according to time and location, and to concentrate their efforts on the most dangerous targets. How does the commander do this? Don't look for stereotypical answers. He can, for example, in order to destroy the primary targets, direct several groups from different directions, he can begin with an engagement of the "enemy's" combined fighter cover, or he can also carry out a variation by employing missiles of various ranges. There are a multitude of other solutions, but in each case from the outset the commander must be able to locate the most dangerous targets in the "enemy's" complex tactical order of battle -- the strike forces, remembering to observe the rules of safety in flight. In group combat the situation can change and become complicated very rapidly. Here the mixing of your own and enemy aircraft, and the cropping up of new points of engagement and the formation of heavily jammed sectors, which cannot be seen from the CP. If you can imagine that all of this is going on simultaneously (the situation is not all that improbable), it is not difficult to understand how important it is for the commander to know how to use the complex of ground means and the reports of the pilots, to logically think in order to properly orient himself in the situation, and to make the best use of the insufficient information. The pilots know how important it is to be confident that at the command post there is an experienced, decisive commander and at the control panels there are competent, resolute officers capable of sending out comprehensive information on the air situation and of coming to their aid at any minute. The word of a tactical control officer giving a routine command on behalf of the commander is law, an order to be acted upon. And what if, when broadcast, this word sounds indecisive or, worst of all, what if there is no word at a time when a command is sorely needed? Take, for example, guidance onto air targets. At first glance this is a simple matter, but, indeed, even when simplified, it is like orienting a person in the dark. Let us suppose that the command post team has directed the fighters into the rear hemisphere of the target at a greater distance than was required. Then they have ahead of them a lengthy pursuit of the enemy, who, if he has detected the pursuit in a timely manner, can set up jamming and break away from the fighters. And it could also happen that the command post team completely failed to bring the fighters into an advantageous position for attack. Does such a thing occur? Unfortunately, yes. Such a miscalculation occurred on one of the tactical air exercises (a tactical command officer dawdled inexcusably). Of course, this affected the setting up of the engagement in the most negative way. When the fighters detected the "enemy" anyway and, in spite of the disadvantageousness of their position, tried to go over to the offensive, their actions were uncoordinated; the group was not a unified whole and was withdrawn from the engagement. Other fighters had to intercept the target. Even worse incidents occur, if the CP team does not observe the rules of flight safety, and allows the fighters to exceed the speed limits set for the given type of aircraft, or allows the aircraft to come dangerously close to each other or the targets, or if the tactical command officers do not remember the minimum permissible fuel reserves for the various distances of the aircraft from the airfield. In such cases, disaster is not far away. Mistakes in matters of command and control are dangerous and cannot always be corrected. The experience of wars on our own soil testifies to the fact that a significant percentage of combat losses of fighter aircraft is related to their being inadequately managed in air engagements. It is only as a result of errors committed by control centers when guiding aircraft, that approximately one third of the aircraft were lost. (See: AVIATION and COSMONAUTICS. 1987. No. 6. P. 4.) The person responsible for these errors is primarily the commander, not only the commander managing combat, but the commander supervising the work of the CP team as well. It is namely he who should make efforts to attain mutual understanding and coordination in the work of his subordinates. At the same time, of foremost importance today is the commander's ability to conduct command and control from a CP equipped with modern automated systems. These two important aspects of a commander's activities deserve individual examination. 2. The Commander and His Subordinates The haze of the scorching air has been hanging over the airfield since morning, washing away the already unclear line of the horizon. On the ramps by the takeoff strip everything is at a standstill in expectation of the departure of the aircraft; the command post team has been on combat alert duty for hours. Behind them is the intense preparation for the big exercises, ahead of them the most crucial moment -- a flight to repulse the "enemy's" first massive raid. Waiting for a raid at any moment is a rather oppressive affair. The longer the waiting lasts, imperceptibly, somehow little by little, an invisible nervous tension grows within the CP team. The commander himself is also quite excited, although he understands very well: he of all people cannot yield to emotions; indeed, dozens of pairs of eyes are trained on him. Sense and experience unerringly prompt him: in order to successfully carry out the upcoming complex mission, it is important to have a calm, psychologically stable situation at the CP. He knows that when people work together and relate kindly with one another, they are capable of a lot. The reasons for this -- a common goal, example, mutual support, competition, and, finally, their psychoemotional attitude. All of this increases each person's capacity for work. Yes, a person's capacity for work depends on his attitude, and here we are speaking not only about capacity for work, but about the performance of the most important combat missions, and, at time of war, about the preservation of defended installations and the lives of pilots in combat. However, all of this is much easier to understand than to provide. The senior commander, in answer to the commander's interrogation over the telephone, just tossed out an angry: "Don't interfere, wait!" Sitting around a table the chief of staff lashed into the chief of communications. And then tactical control officers turned away from the radar indicators and stared at the commander, who had just finished his telephone conversation. The semi-darkness of the command post prevented him from making out their staring faces. A feeling of annoyance intensified the monotonous humming of the fan, which wasn't cooling. It was stuffy, hot, and the commander couldn't restrain himself: "Well, what are you staring at? You're not supposed to be looking at me, you're supposed to be looking at the air situation!" He struck at their very hearts and then he turned away as if he had been deeply offended by his subordinates. And indeed the commander had everything: knowledge, experience, resolute qualities. But there was just one thing -- he did not have enough respect for other people, and yes, if you will, modesty. It is not difficult to imagine what took place in the consciousness of those people, what humiliation they experienced as a result of those unjust words. Sullen and silent they no longer expect anything good out of dealings with the commander. Let us leave the stuffy command post building for a short time and concern ourselves with the further development of events. What has happened makes one wonder. It is customary to call the CP the brain of the regiment. This "brain" will function more reliably the better each of its cells functions. But this depends on the coordination of the actions of the team, how well the members "fit" together, and their interaction with the commander. Of course, unnecessary conversation and inattentiveness are impermissible at the CP. What's that? Chance or echelon are not very significant in the chain of disorders? It is not terribly difficult for the experienced commander to examine this. But what worse place for the rude shout than when the splash of emotions rises above the logic of reasoning. And what is the result? Don't resentment and enmity toward the commander, who should not respond so rudely, obscure the sense of duty and the desire of the subordinates to fulfill as well as possible that part of the combat mission which was entrusted to them? We return once again to the command post and glance at the vertical plotting board that we have mentioned so often that is now already thickly covered with the various colors of the flight routes. Red and blue lines extend toward each other, bend and intersect. Gradually the "enemy's" tactical intentions are taking shape. His aircraft are attempting to break through to defended installations from two directions, maneuvering at an altitude under the cover of jamming. The air situation is becoming more complicated with every passing minute. Whitish bands of jamming thickly dotting the screens of the radar indicators, rapidly spread, become brighter, show more contour, and the tiny blips from the multitude of targets can hardly be distinguished one from another against the background of blinking dull color. The fighters repulse a massive "enemy" raid. Both sides are exceedingly active. At the command post there is the usual working rhythm of combat operations; one hears reports, commands, and messages delivered in muffled tones. The commander is at his work station. Now he is calmness and self-control personified; he expresses his feelings judiciously and with restraint, he strictly controls his behavior. The commander's intonation, gestures, facial expressions, and the expression of his eyes are transmitted immediately to his subordinates. They all understand each other from half a word, half a gesture; everyone is imbued with a common goal -- how best to carry out the assigned mission. It is as if the low noise of the equipment creates a special coziness; nobody notices the stuffiness. Pair after pair, echelon after echelon, in the thunder of the afterburners they take off from the airfield. The tactical control officers do not take their eyes off of the blips on the indicator screens and guide the fighters onto the appropriate targets according to the commander's decision. It is natural that the commander acts as the unified center, the nucleus of command and control. He is constantly in his subordinates' field of view; their attention is riveted on him, as to the conductor of an orchestra. Yes, the CP team is a peculiar sort of orchestra, where the role of the conductor belongs to the commander. It is namely he who must make the decisions, encompassing the strength of collective thought. But if the orchestra plays something wrong it only lowers the quality of the music, whereas a false note in the work of even the most insignificant "musician" at the CP can cause the fulfillment of the combat mission to be frustrated no less than the negligence of the "conductor" himself. The individual monitoring the plotting board was careless in plotting the information, things are not going well for the communications operator, the command and control officer is late delivering his commands, there is dissonance in the commands, in the clarifications... Is it really possible to conduct command and control with aides like these? Not a single of the most competent and talented commanders can get along without a well-trained and hardworking CP team, but even a model team consisting of highly qualified specialists cannot ensure combat success without a competent commander. Such is the dialectic relationship at the commander - command post team level. The commander cannot exist on his own without a team acting as a single mechanism to evaluate the diversity of the air situation, and all the matters with which the subordinates working at the various stations are occupied. Only playing "by the notes", i.e., the coordination of all the members of the team, will ensure success. The commander is at his work station. His gaze is directed at the plotting board; question after question occurs to him: what strength level of fighters should he employ; at what point of engagement; in cooperation with whom, and in what sequence should the current large target be intercepted? In what direction should efforts be concentrated in order to achieve superiority of forces over the enemy? No matter how comprehensively the commander has been trained, here he cannot get along without his own form of feedback, whereby the communication is not passive but active, entailing not only reports concerning the fulfillment of orders and commands, but also the issuing of evaluations full of initiative useful for the commander's decision making, and of constructive suggestions for the combat employment of the fighters. Such timely evaluations and recommendations are of great value. To a great extent they help to find a way out of critical situations. But how important it is for the commander to regard them with interest so that he himself does not falter in those tense minutes. And what if the commander is nervous and this inner agitation robs him of his equilibrium in dealing with his subordinates? What if he once again gives free rein to his emotions, is peremptory or categoric in his opinions, is persistent even when he is wrong, ignores people, cuts short their reports? Then don't expect any good to come of it. On the job even the most capable specialists are not immune to flaws. Look, someone has been slow in coming up with important information, somewhere a command was improperly executed or understood, a piece of equipment was improperly used. But why? People are rather afraid to show personal initiative, to ask that unintelligible commands be repeated, knowing that they will be met with the same shout and the same fault-finding of a commander who doesn't know how to listen. This is the picture you get. The air situation is constantly changing, the leader has to work under extreme pressure and at the same time his subordinates are silent and instead of helping the commander they are waiting for additional instructions. But if the one is thinking about everything, then the others have simply stopped thinking. This way it is easier and simpler not to have to wrack your own brain, and you can always conceal your own tactical incompetence and laziness. And so the commander literally has to extort the data essential to him and waste time on unnecessary interrogations. Thus, he himself deprives himself of the support of his subordinates. Such a picture could be the result of the team's being inadequately trained. Of course, well-founded evaluations and suggestions can actually only be given by officers who recognize their functional duties down to the last detail. People should be trained to work out the priority of reports, thereby ensuring that they will receive the best possible interpretation by the commander. Causes of a purely psychological nature should not be given a low priority. Subordinates don't understand a commander as well when he shouts. The strength of his personality lies not in rudeness, but, more likely, on the contrary, in his tactfulness, sensitivity, and attentiveness to people. We always admire leaders who know how to conduct themselves, we see them in a good light. Self-control is a useful quality for everyone under any circumstances, but in tense situations it is simply a necessity. In order that subordinates not hide behind their commander's back, but work actively and strive to make a feasible contribution to the common problem, the commander does not have to strain his vocal chords, but quietly and calmly enlist the services of the entire CP team to conduct command and control. Then the task of command and control will become a common task and together it will be an easier task to fulfil. The science of not offending, if you will, is the easiest and at the same time the most complex concept for all of us. How then can one manage to put together a team that is not just a haphazardly assembled group of people, but a solid collective, cemented by a sense of duty and responsibility? The secret here lies in the commander's ability to create a healthy moral and psychological atmosphere at the CP. It is important for each person, sensibly and with feeling, to realize his role and place in the mission being carried out by the CP team, as well as to be confident that when expressing the most audacious, even incorrect, ideas, he will not be rudely rebuffed by the commander. And, nevertheless, to develop a steadfast belief in the commander -- that is half the battle. He himself should know and believe that each subordinate will fulfil his duties as he should. Without this it is not possible to have mutual understanding between the commander and his subordinates. Here's another thing the commander must not forget. The command post team is made up of people with a variety of personalities and idiosyncracies, with their own "subtleties" and "vagaries." One may not like the way his work station neighbor converses, a second may not like the way this same colleague jokes, a third may not like the manners of the second. Forced as a result of their duty to constantly associate with one another, they all experience sympathy and antipathy which from time to time are difficult to explain. Here it isn't mutual understanding that occurs, but alienation and hostility among people -- something we refer to as psychological incompatibility. The commander must help people to control their feelings, to exhibit mutual trust and benevolence. He has opportunities to do this because he sees his subordinates in the most varied situations and observes how they react, not only on a professional level, but also on a psychological one. For this reason it is easier for him to find motivating factors which will cause a person to act one way or another. Alas, this does not always pan out. "Why didn't you give me a timely update on the changes in the air situation?", a commander reproaches one of his officers. "You yourself ordered that we weren't to report unless we were asked," the officer's gaze reflects sincere bewilderment, and there are distinct traces of nervousness in the intonation of his voice as he answers. The officer was reporting about everything he saw on the plotting board without any system and without selecting the most substantive information and in the course of his reports the main points got watered down. He could not yet grasp the meaning of his functional duties and simply bothered the commander. Then it made sense in his case to instruct him only to report when asked. But in this case he also received a reproof that he simply did not understand. But if you constantly reproach people for improper actions without taking into consideration the motivating factors, what will the result be? Evidently, one should treat genuine experts in their field differently than one would treat random persons committing errors in their work. One should be patient in dealing with each person, show him how he could better contribute to the fulfillment of the common combat mission. You must adhere to the rule: if a glitch occurred somewhere, if someone was inaccurate -- don't rush in with remarks, and certainly not with reproofs, but point out the error in a calm tone, in a businesslike manner, to the person whose fault it was, and explain what the ramifications could be. And now we once again turn to the commander who understands the secret of interaction with his subordinates. He is still managing the combat. The "enemy's" forces have not dried up, new targets continue to appear on the plotting boards and indicators, the thunder of the engines of airplanes taking off has not died down on the airfield. The commander sees that his men are tired and that fatigue is growing exponentially. Fatigue is an insidious thing. I recall that government commissions investigating the causes for railroad, shipping, aviational, and other catastrophes found that one of the main causes was fatigue of personnel brought about by systematic overworking. Prolonged physical and emotional stress give rise to apathy and indifference to the work being performed. The time put into the situation sometimes increases several fold, while the accuracy of the operations, on the other hand, sharply declines, and mistakes occur where they aren't at all expected. Of course, not every case of fatigue gives rise to an explosion or a catastrophe, but one thing is clear: people require rest and recreation; otherwise, they might miss important commands or might not react to them in the proper way. But the commander cannot yet offer his subordinates the rest and recreation that they have earned. In other words, from time to time you've got to at least have a psychological release. For a moment the activity on the plotting board and indicators has died down a bit, but the specialists cannot leave their work stations. How long will this lull last? Only the "enemy" can answer that question, but this is precisely the time to relieve some of the nervous tension built up after the long minutes, or even hours, of tiresome, monotonous work. Who should do this? The commander, of course. It goes without saying that he himself has just experienced at least as much tension, he has shouldered as ponderable a burden; he would also like to take it easy, but first he has to take care of his subordinates. This is his duty as commander. But very little is required to do this: take a microphone in hand, call those who are particularly tired, and with a simple joke relieve the emotional tension. Of course, the wise commander will not start to scold and deride someone for a mistake, and will not allow himself to tell even one of those condescending jokes which might damage a person's dignity or pride. Commander and subordinates... In our time public opinion has become exceptionally stirred up. People are aware of their right to participate in everything. Subordinates are watching their commander attentively; they see and evaluate everything. How complicated interaction can be sometimes in the tense rhythm of combat operations and how important it is to maintain the common equilibrium without pressure, not to allow someone's superiority in experience, in official position, or in their quick wittedness to turn into resentment, to wound someone's self-esteem. The people on the team are different, and, not without reason, a wise Armenian saying goes: "The way a commander is, that's how his subordinates are". 3. The Commander at the Computer The commander was uneasy. One minute he was sitting, the next pacing up and down, which for him was a sign of anxious brooding; now he sullenly glanced at his subordinates, but it was no use to upbraid them. The soft blinking light of the displays was reflected on the concentrated faces of the officers sitting at the display panels. They were processing data, performing various calculations, and using the information retrieval system. In the briefest period of time they found and delivered the necessary information to the commander. However, returning to his work station the commander glanced at the column of figures, graphs, and text fragments flashing on the screen somewhat anxiously and then transferred his gaze to the electronic plotting board. The information set down by the computer printer not only gave an idea about the air conditions, but also showed the potential changes in the conditions based on the decisions made. The situation was shaping up unfavorably: fighters sent up to intercept a group air target are not in the best initial position for attack and the correlation of forces is also not advantageous. Every commander is familiar with the feeling of vexation which arises after a serious error in decision-making. What essentially happened? Was the fighter force inadequate, were the pilots not well-trained enough, or was the command post team at fault? None of the above. There is another reason: the interception was performed according to a decision made by a computer, but the target went under the cover of jamming and actively maneuvered, its tracking was unsteady, the assessment questionable. And nevertheless, the commander decided to stick with the recommendations issued by the computer. The officer turns once again to the computer. He wants to analyze the various decision scenarios, to juxtapose them, to evaluate the effectiveness of corrective measures. The input data and the conditions have changed... And again the computer has come to life, its multicolored lights are flashing; maybe this time it will be a different scenario. But, alas, under conditions where the information is incomplete or unauthentic, where there are alternative combat combinations which could not all be programmed, even the most modern computer can strike out. "What was it like in the past, when there weren't any electronic gizmos to interfere with the commander's thinking and decision-making," sighed the commander and added with unconcealed irony, "We truly have woe from an electronic mind, and now you're supposed to do the thinking for a machine." In that remark there is a hint of nostalgia for the old, "manual" methods of command and control -- a phenomenon which you might say is typical. Such is human psychology. It is not difficult to understand: isn't it better to act in accordance with the experience you have than to trust something unfamiliar? But let's get on with the story. The commander, who at the outset shifted his functions to the computer, was able to correct the decisions he had made earlier. What remained was for him to put into effect the scenario which he had found to redeem the situation, which, as it turned out was not all that difficult. ...The leader of the fighter group which was already being guided onto the target in the automated mode has not uttered a word since takeoff; the command post has also been silent. Just this sort of silent "conversation" was going on between the leader and the instruments in his cockpit, which were providing him with information for executing an interception. The group was already approaching the target, but the command and control officer, in keeping with the commander's revised decision, was able to recalculate and enter the new data into the computer. The triangular indexes moved smoothly along the indicator scales; a series of figures lit up on the message panels indicating the flight parameters. The automated system computed another trajectory for the fighters, and they then executed its "commands" with maximum accuracy. The most important thing was to maintain the assigned parameters, and that is not all that complex. Freeing the pilots from other secondary operations enabled them to better evaluate the situation and to get ready for the attack. Complete radio silence enabled them to achieve an element of surprise. However, CP commanders and pilots who are a little older remember the times when guidance using an automatic control system was considered a novelty. They remember how skeptical they were when introduced to this system in flight. Silent flight without radio communications between the CP and the pilot, without constant prompting from the ground, was unusual. The pilots started to get nervous, they were late in reacting to the instrument commands. Switching their attention to those instruments, they forgot to monitor the other indicators. The movements of the control surfaces became more abrupt. "It's all the fault of automation, it doesn't pull you out where you're supposed to be," sighed the commander, excusing the pilots after they had returned to the airfield from a failed photo-reconnaissance mission. "Guidance the old way, by voice, would have been more reliable." Is it a matter of automation here? No, it works reliably. To make it the scapegoat is simply frivolous. Why, then, did so many treat automation with skepticism and mistrust? The old way was well known, tested repeatedly in practice, and seemed by force of habit to be more reliable than the new way, although the new way possessed many advantages. Therefore, along with the newest electronics, they set up areas with experimental radar indicators, nomograms, tables, and gave them a preference. Stormy arguments ensued as to whether the computer infringes on the commander's creative thinking. A considerable amount of time has passed since then and perhaps there is no recollection of those noisy arguments, but today, as well, even experienced commanders sigh. They are troubled by the complexity of the new systems that need to be thoroughly mastered, but what troubles them even more is the necessity to do without the customary methods of command and control and to shift from direct interaction with subordinates to contact with them through automated means. Indeed, using the new system instructions and reports are passed in the form of specific signals and are interpreted without any emotional effect, and the very air situation is depicted, if one can use that term, in "coded form." The result is that the logic of the commander's decision is not known until the end, the need for emotional information is not satisfied and the commander's personality, to a certain degree, loses its sensual specificity. Nevertheless, we are attempting, however briefly, to refrain from sighs of nostalgia, though we are speaking not only about today, but about days gone by as well. It's bad for any field if a specialist abandons new technology and arms himself with a crow-bar and a shovel. In the field of aviation this is even dangerous. We wouldn't want to exaggerate, but what can you do if the time parameters for any one of the commander's actions exceed his psychological capabilities for making decisions and for command and control, or if the amount of information coming to him becomes so great that he doesn't have time to comprehend it? Can you imagine a volume of information consisting of multi-digit figures? Of course one can imagine it, but what is this volume of figures for? To understand what massive amounts of information concerning the enemy, his aircraft, and the conditions of the air situation circulate in contemporary command and control systems, what amount of time is required to process it and manually transmit it from the radar control panels at the CP, and for it to be assimilated by the commander. This creates a situation that is reminiscent of the famous story about the ill-fated meteorologist, who, when asked if he could, with complete accuracy, consider all the factors affecting tomorrow's weather, replied, "Yes, but to do that I'll need a week to perform the calculations." That is why the time is not too far off, when the basic mass of information will be fixed, stored, and represented in the machine's memory, when the commander simply cannot get along without automation. The way in which automation will serve the commander will depend on the commander's ability to use automation in his own interests. In the complex interaction of the radio technical means delivering information, of the electronic "brain" reprocessing it, and of the operations of the commander himself, the situation is evaluated, a decision takes shape, the optimal flight paths and flight modes of the fighters to the points of engagement are calculated, and the commands to the pilots are worked out. The foundation of this interaction is the principle: transfer to the machine those tasks which it performs better than a human being, and leave to the human being those tasks with which only he can cope. The concept "better than a human being" includes, above all, the computer's incontestable superiority in those of its properties with which a human being cannot compete: speed, accuracy of calculation, formalized view of systems of logic. These properties make the computer a special amplifier of the commander's own creative abilities. Automation can do a lot, but not everything. A still greater share is left to the commander. You see, the computer considers a limited number of factors. Strictly speaking, the system of algorithms and their function in the automatic control system are essentially a programmed operation for processing the commander's decision, only in the most general situations. As with any logical task, this operation cannot be formalized without specific assumptions; in the calculations and recommendations there are always some errors which are permissible for some situations, but require correction in others. The commander thinks more slowly, but more complexly. However, it is precisely thanks to this complexity that he is capable of making decisions in non-typical, not previously experienced situations, under the most intricate circumstances, where (in any event, for the time being) the most "intelligent" computers would fall down. When there is insufficient information and the situation is unclear, as was the case, for example, in the episode described at the beginning of the section, a computer's decision would also be incomplete and under those conditions there would be no replacement for the commander. One could hardly expect the computer to exhibit initiative and resourcefulness; it won't be able to "think up" a war stratagem, and, you see, it is thanks to those capabilities that victory is achieved in combat. There is yet another quality that the commander possesses which cannot be attained by a computer and that is adequate in the evaluation of the situation, not giving way to a precise quantitative description. But, from another aspect, you can't get away from indecision, doubts (man -- not machine), and then the minutes granted to the commander by the computer he can use for deliberating and for more precise evaluations. That is why in contemporary automatic control systems the commander is given the right to interfere with the operation of the computer and correct its recommendations. The commander is free to make decisions based on the computer's recommendations, he can take them partially into consideration or even reject them completely. He is guided by his own experience, the reports of the members of the CP team, and, of course, the situation's degree of uncertainty. As they say, you need to be able to listen to another person's mind, but you can't live through another person's mind. This means that you must not blindly follow the recommendations of the computer, but act according to the conditions as they take shape, making corrections for every specific situation; you must know that the computer is prompting only one of the admissible decisions. Look what is emerging from our discussions. In the system "computer - commander" only the latter is active, and that is what determines his place in the system. Unfortunately, for some commanders the complexity of this system becomes a psychological barrier, and they begin to disregard at least some of its elements and capabilities. Sometimes the other extreme occurs -- the commander overestimates the computer's capabilities. The commander views the computer as a mechanism which can conduct command and control automatically. From this sort of commander you hear the expression now and then, "the computer produced the optimum variant." But the computer cannot think. Its intellect is simply a metaphorical name referring to programmed computers which imitate human activity. When the commander has unlimited faith in the infallibility of a computer, he transfers to it the decision-making role and becomes completely dependent on it. We recall once again the commander mentioned earlier who didn't know how to deal with the information provided him by the automatic control system. I would say that is a classic example of the illiterate use of that system. Today at the end of a century of scientific-technological revolution and electronics, when the computer handles more and more of the command and control operations, questions are already occurring to the military reader: how will the relationship between the commander and the computer shape up in the future, and what new innovations await him? These are not just idle questions. Let's try to have a look at the commander role of our successors. The flood of information concerning the air situation is increasing, and, as it does, the time available to the commander is inexorably shortened -- a consequence of the growing dynamics of combat. The situation calls for perfected human-machine complexes based on expert systems which enable the automation of those command and control operations which cannot be based solely on ancient, eternally correct mathematics. The functioning of these complexes is based on longer-range methods, and, in particular, on the methods of artificial intelligence, which enable machines to solve informal-logical and heuristic problems without human interference, to represent these problems in the computer, and give them to the commander for decision-making. Of course, we are speaking about systems in the more-distant-future. They will be able to relieve the commander of the burden of time devoted to uncreative problems and will provide an even more complete combination of the computer's capabilities with a human being's intellectual faculties. It will make possible a transition from the passive routine whereby the commander simply enters data into the computer and receives a ready result, to an active routine of interaction with the computer, as well as the automatic management of a data base and control over its expansion. Using this system, in addition to the variant calculated by the computer, the commander will be able to enter his own intuitive variant into the computer, and it will be able to evaluate and select the best of them according to the accepted criterion (the extent of the damages being prevented to the defended installations, the number of targets hit, etc.). And yet another innovation. With time, when the computer has the capability to perceive a human voice, although, perhaps not with all of its various levels of meaning, it will become possible for the commander to carry on a conversation with the computer, and, in the course of their dialogue, for the computer to give him alternative solutions based on the model "if..., then..." This innovation requires clarification. You will have at your disposal a portable terminal unit which is connected to the computer. Using this unit you can simply read some sort of text and the computer will understand everything. Evaluating the situation or making a decision, you enter the initial information into this mechanism, and then a series of questions and responses in dialogue form ensues. The computer poses questions requesting more information, you respond to them, ask your own questions and receive responses. The displays and graph plotters "draw" and write without any mood swings, fixing the results of the calculations; the voice, devoid of human bias, recommends the very actions for the commander to expediently undertake. In so doing, it explains how and on the basis of what in the system the given problem was solved, and demonstrates the process of the "deductions" made by the computer. The first steps in developing units capable of spoken dialogue have already been taken. It is true, they are limited to a specific vocabulary that the computer is capable of perceiving and synthesizing. The commander can expect innovations which are at least as interesting when he goes up into the air with his pilots. The onboard control system based on machine vision, machine voice recognition, and machine comprehension of the commander's speech, will systematize, summarize, and depict the tactical situation. Hopes are also being expressed for the system's great potential in processing recommendations for the selection of tactical methods, for the employment of armaments and electronic warfare through human-machine dialogue. Here the system retains the "right" to warn the commander if it is dangerous or impossible to carry out his decision. Then the system can suggest another solution. For example, let's say you have taken off to intercept an air target. In accordance with that target's maneuver shown on your display, your flight path is revised and a variant for the set-up of the air engagement is worked out. But this variant doesn't suit you and you enter amendments. Having received its assignment the computer begins to "cogitate" and then suggests another variant, taking into account the new parameters of the situation. You accept it and on the display in numerical and graphic form the zone boundaries are depicted along with the time for the launching of the missiles or the employment of another type of armament. Then, with your agreement, the target is hit in the first and subsequent attacks. But now the battle is over, and it turns out that the fuel reserve is insufficient to return to your airfield. During the engagement this information was not put out over the display so that you would not be distracted, since the information was not urgent enough. Now, however, by way of alternatives the computer recommends landing at one of the reserve airfields. Having glanced at the display, however, you reject that, knowing that at that airfield the airstrip is damaged. The next variant suggested by the computer is acceptable and then it assigns you a flight mode to proceed to a landing. This dialogue system at the command post and in the air is a great, as yet unrealized, business. The computer prompts the commander as to what he needs to do, what comes after what, what along with what is inexpedient. But then either an idea occurs to the commander that requires immediate implementation, or a doubt. And then begin the clarifications, the corrections, and even the "wranglings" with the computer, which remembers the finest nuances and details of the situation if the fatigued or absent-minded commander forgets them. What is concealed in the "soul" of the electronic intellect? We won't exaggerate the potential of the dialogue system and other systems. They are completely determined by the models installed in them, by what was considered in them and how, and they will never be able to become phenomenal robots or the cybernetic likeness of a commander. We can only speak of means which, to one extent or another, amplify or broaden the intellectual capabilities of the commander. In order to skillfully combine the inquisitive mind of the commander with the rapid and accurate calculations of the computer, you need to develop, if it can be expressed in those terms, computer literacy, computer culture, and they should begin with a basic psychological revolution in consciousness in relation to automation. Will the commander judiciously evaluate the computer's recommendations if he doesn't understand the very process of its operation, if he doesn't know what a computer can and cannot do, if he is not familiar with that complex of factors which its creators considered for the model installed in it, or with the limiting conditions or the accepted allowances? And one more thing. Computers dash old conceptions about leadership methods. They require a different way of thinking on the part of the commander and the CP team, a different quality of work at automated work stations, an extremely clear-cut differentiation of the duties of the personnel in order that they can carry out their functions without unnecessary commands and questions. In order to do this, in addition to his purely commander-oriented and traditional skills for leading his subordinates, the commander should possess the skills of an operator steering a piece of complex technical equipment. Just as other members of the CP team, the commander needs to know how to quickly read and analyze symbols, forms containing letters and numbers, and other designations on the screens of the situation indicators. He must be able to work with a keyboard, to retrieve the necessary information from the data base, to enter command and control commands, expressing the complexity of his thought in an extremely clear-cut manner using the limited capabilities of the technical means. And all of these operations must be carried out without hesitation; otherwise, the time gained, thanks to the computer's rapid operating speed, will be wasted. It is as if they are both simple, easy to understand, and subjective -- the fast operating computer and the experience of the commander. But, imagine how long and labor-intensive the work of those people is in order to train or "bring to life" the computer, to develop their mathematical and program support, how the titles alone of the input data they have to enter and consolidate in the automatic control system need to be worked out. But, you see, without the computer program the computer is nothing but an "empty brain," an expensive but useless piece of equipment. Yes, "service" entails a lot of preliminary work, but it's difficult to get along without it. The role of the commander is also great here. He must know on what basis the problems are programmed, especially with contradictory data, and the principles for forming computer algorithms for processing information; otherwise, it will be difficult to have a formalized conception of the operations and phenomena which must be replaced with the models realized within the computer and to correctly put the problem to specialists and work in close contact with them. Such are the demands of time. That's the way it is today. Whether we want it or not, whether we like it or not, we either love computers or cannot stand them from the time we are children, but we've got to use them. The commander who doesn't learn to deal with computers as freely as he deals with plotting boards and indicators will soon be likened to someone who doesn't know how to read or write. * * * The CP lives by combat. Here all the threads of command and control meet and are held in the hands of the CP team headed by the commander, an outstanding individual possessing superior business-like qualities and talent, reacting quickly and correctly to changes in the situation. His subordinates use the commander as their standard. They notice how confidently he gives his instructions, how the chiefs converse with him. This is how it should be. Command and control has never been considered easy. Just look at yourself, commander. Don't you make mistakes from time to time in your decisions as a result of not fully evaluating the situation? Are you always fair in your dealings with your subordinates? Doesn't your automated work station oppress you, and don't you cover your eyes if these indicators of your managerial activity oscillate somewhere on the level of mediocrity? Chapter VIII. Know How to Overcome Yourself 1. The Burdensome Time of Mental and Psychological Stress Air combat is packed to the limit with difficult tactical situations. The enemy might act within any altitude range, from the most unexpected directions, using all types of armaments and radar jamming. It is precisely with such a resourceful, well-trained enemy that the fighters will have to meet in a heated dogfight. To achieve victory in battle each pilot should have confident mastery of his aircraft and armaments, and be able to quickly and correctly use the tactical methods which are specifically appropriate for the given situation. But what do the mental-psychological and combat morale qualities mean for him. In brutal dogfights fraught with the unexpected, where just one false maneuver can cost a life, pilots experience, among other things, severe mental and psychological stress. Everyone has developed a sense of self-preservation, which weighs on the psyche, melding from time to time reason and will, and one must know how to overcome this. However, not everyone can or wants to experience hardship and danger. A human being is a great master when it comes to that which he desires. Self-deception, which is based on subconscious fear, can easily become conviction. In this regard it is apropos to make a short excursion into the history of World War II, where there was not a dearth of dangerous, psychologically difficult situations, to recall long-standing events. All sorts of things were happening at that time, all sorts of people were at the front. Back then cowards and panickers, thrown by their leaders into combat, were treated with contempt and anger. And the reason for those unseemly actions, in my view, can be traced, above all, to the fact that the pilots had not been trained for an encounter with dangers in a mental-psychological sense. Here is a tragic episode. It happened at the 762nd fighter aircraft station in July 1943 the second day after the battle of Kurskaya began. The air was simply swarming still with "Messerschmidts" and "Junkers." An eight-aircraft element of Yak-7 fighters under the command of squadron commander Captain L. Avyekov took off to provide cover for the troops. Having detected two groups of nine "Junkers" flying under the cover of "Messerschmidts" the commander made a daring decision: to attack the first group of nine aircraft with three pairs and to provide cover for our actions with the fourth pair. However, when we went over to the attack, instead of our own covering pair we saw a line of "Messerschmidts." The subsequent events developed rapidly; an attack didn't come off. Returning to the airfield after this grave, unsuccessful engagement we did a great deal of thinking. Either the fascists shot down the pair providing cover, or they didn't know their tactic well enough and didn't know how to get into the engagement. But it was something else. When, after landing, we saw the "missing" pair of aircraft on the ramp and asked the leader why it happened like that, he irresolutely alluded to engine trouble. Right! We understood that he, by the way, a pretty good pilot, had simply gotten cold feet. That was cowardice that turned into a crime. We could recall even more acute, critical situations which occurred in the war years and also in our time. All of them are a grim reminder that you cannot completely rely only on the piloting technique and the tactical training of pilots. One must not forget about the high level of mental and psychological stress that they are experiencing. Could you weigh their burden, measure and compare the end results of battle? In aviation, unfortunately, there are not yet the appropriate statistical data and tangible indicators to make such estimations. But one can judge that these stresses are not all that harmless from the research conducted in related fields. Thus, foreign military psychologists calculated that out of the 1,630,000 army veterans in the USA who participated in World War II, approximately one million suffered from various psychological disorders and were subjected to the appropriate treatment. Of them, 545,000 were immediately pronounced unfit for further service. (TRUPPENDIENST. 1982. No. 1.) The correlation between psychological and physical traumas in the Israeli army was 3:10 in the Arab-Israeli war of 1973 and 2.3:10 in the war in Lebanon in 1982. (MILITARY REVIEW. 1985. N0. 7.) Statistics and indicators are quite eloquent, aren't they? And now we return to mental and psychological stress in the course of our combat training. Without these stresses here we also couldn't get along, but in peacetime, when there is no real enemy in the air, these stresses manifest themselves in a different way. Each new generation of fighter aircraft distinguishes itself from the preceding one not only with its improved aviational-tactical features and its weaponry, but also with the increased emotional and nervous tension which the pilots experience. A contemporary fighter aircraft is the focus of electronics, automation, and the most complicated systems. Now an integral part of the onboard systems, they introduce substantial changes in the work of flying, they facilitate it so much that it seems as if the automatic system itself could control the airplane. However, the most highly perfected equipment does not relieve the pilot of the oppressive time of psychological and mental stress and never will. It just takes on a new quality. It has been determined, for example, that when flying faster than the speed of sound the pilot performs various operations 6-8 times more than when traveling at speeds below the speed of sound. This means that when controlling the aircraft he should make decisions faster. A delay of even a few seconds could lead to irreversible consequences. Therefore, although the flight speed alone does not have a direct influence on the pilot's body, its psychological effect is very tangible. The need for highly accurate, coordinated movements and the combination of them with complicated thought processes in multi-mode flight leads to an increase in emotional tension. Therefore, as the saying goes, the pilot is constantly fired up. He has a sense of heaviness, of fatigue, he doesn't always manage to work out a rhythm to his thinking in order to interpret and process the information he has received. Now imagine that this new generation of fighters has just arrived at your unit. To learn a new aircraft -- that is the hidden desire of every pilot. You want to sit in the cockpit as soon as possible and take off. But here is one more episode on the psychological plane. For a long time you have been flying a type of fighter that you have already mastered; you know it down to the "last nuts and bolts"; you feel completely in charge in the cockpit. You approach the new unfamiliar aircraft with this feeling. Confidence in one's own strengths is a valuable quality. It enables a pilot to discover his own capabilities to the fullest extent, to better perform the most complex tasks. But, on the other hand, as strange as it may seem, your former skills -- complex conditioned reflexes, can become an unforeseen obstacle in mastering the new equipment. The thing is, aircraft not only have similarities in their general principles of control, they also have differences. Therefore, the influence of old skills on the new ones is two-fold: either positive, or negative. In either case the previously acquired experience will show, and it won't always be useful. The new aircraft has an unusual form, a different nose droop angle in the forward part of the fuselage, a different cockpit. There in the cockpit behind the smoky light is the realm of levers, toggle switches, familiar and unfamiliar instruments. The physical essence of the ongoing processes in the onboard equipment is changing, for example, in the automatic control systems and in the piloting and navigational systems. In addition, the piloting technique of the former and the new aircraft sometimes differs substantially in the degree and rate of motion of the control levers and the pedals and in proportion to the increase in the sensitivity of the new aircraft to the tilting of the control surfaces, precision is required in distributing and changing your focus of attention. These constructive changes, depriving the pilot of his usual reference points, and the parting with the former piloting techniques give rise to additional psychological stress and it doesn't go easy on either the experienced pilot or the young pilot. The new skills have not yet taken shape and the old ones already can't be used to their full extent. I don't think that I'll meet with objections if I say that transferring your skills from one aircraft to another is not only keeping in step with technological development, but it is also a surmounting, even a breaking of established patterns in one's consciousness, patterns leading to the automatism of pilots' actions with the aircraft control systems. There needs to be a restructuring of skills, but the established habits/patterns prevent a pilot from perceiving this difference, from going beyond the limits of the usual and mastering an aircraft that requires a different type of piloting. Psychologically, pilots are unequally prepared for that. The novelty and complexity of the technology could give rise to both unnecessary emotional experiences and caution (this is the antipode of the concept "confidence in one's own powers"), as well as self-confidence (as mentioned above). In conjunction with the still insufficient depth of knowledge and the lack of necessary skills, they will hardly be capable of quickly mastering a new aircraft. The practice of switching pilots from conventional to jet aircraft in the post-war years showed that the main feature determining success was the emotional factor associated with the novelty and the dissimilarity of the equipment. To master a fighter equipped with the newest control systems, with different sighting-surveillance devices, with missiles, to learn to pilot it, is not a simple matter. But the burden of mental and psychological stress becomes heavier when the pilots are subjected to extreme situations which we call special cases in flight. In our time aviation technology has become more reliable. Everything has been done to make flight safe, and not every pilot will experience that extremely unpleasant feeling one gets when an engine or equipment fails, or in other similar unforeseeable situations. The majority of aviators have not run up on situations like this in their entire flying careers. But, on the other hand, the increased reliability of the equipment gives rise to an exaggerated sense of well-being in pilots. Their "contribution" is now being made by the automation of aircraft control. Actually, this is a double-edged weapon. Observing the instrument readings isn't equivalent to active operations. When a man participates directly in aircraft control he reacts incomparably more quickly to breakdowns than when aircraft control is automated. In order to compensate for this circumstance, he needs to maintain a greater degree of vigilance in flight, to be in constant readiness to act in the event of sudden breakdowns. But this means that pilots' nervous and psychological stress will by no means decrease. Much has been written about the effect of extreme situations on a pilot's actions. It is still important for us to know that the more reliable the equipment is and the less likely it is to break down, the more unexpected these breakdowns are and the more difficult it becomes to act. Let's consider one more trait of the human psyche -- the fear of the unknown. It has been noted that ignorance, as well as incomplete information, have a negative effect on a person and reduce his emotional stability, give rise to a feeling of uncertainty and sometimes confusion. Pilots who have been in acute, critical situations when it was necessary to act swiftly and precisely say that the hardest thing was to determine the root of the situation and to determine its cause. A good illustration of this point is found in the story I heard told by a pilot at one of the aviation units. ...Carrying out the mission at an altitude of 12,000 meters, I was going along, climbing slightly, when I saw on the speed indicator that I was rapidly losing speed. What could have happened? Having decided that the engine thrust was decreasing, I brought the aircraft into horizontal flight, but the speed continued to decrease. I shifted into descent. I quickly lost altitude and I realized that to hesitate or to make a mistake could mean death. Alas, that only aggravated the situation. A feeling of heaviness came over my whole body, an unpleasant sense of uncertainty in my own actions and fear of the unknown. My hands seemed like they belonged to someone else, they didn't obey me. I began to doubt the readings on all the instruments, my gaze literally dashed all over the instrument panel. Under normal circumstances I could see all of the instruments well, but then in that incomprehensible situation my perceptions were dim. I could only determine that the needle of the vertical speed indicator showed descent. Constantly thinking about what had happened, which instrument was wrong, it didn't occur to me to report to the flight director. But then I could tell from the aircraft control stick that the speed of the aircraft had quickly increased; I heard the noise that is characteristic for flight at a very great speed, and I understood: the speed indicator had broken down. The tension immediately subsided, and then I could clearly make out on the instrument dials: rpms normal, oil temperature and pressure in the engine -- unchanged. The ability to sense the aircraft's operation by sound, and the knowledge of its behavior at various flight speeds had saved the day. I went over to piloting the aircraft using the back-up instruments and safely returned to the airfield. The frank confession of a rather experienced pilot who found himself for the first time in a critical situation and his actions under the influence of paralyzing fear is understandable. He wasn't psychologically hardened enough to be able to maintain his cool, his calculating nature, his self-control. It's hard to say whether this pilot could have spoken so openly about this flight if it had taken place at a lower altitude. I propose that we examine one more situation, which at first glance is not similar to the previous one. A fighter was taking off, swiftly gaining speed on the takeoff run. It was already time to raise the front wheel when a red light -- the danger signal, flashed before the pilot's eyes. In the cockpit the signal light "oil pressure falling" blazed on. The pilot braked and aborted the takeoff. Looking in the periscope the pilot saw that the tail of the aircraft was blanketed in a cloud of whitish smoke. Without thinking, he leaped from the cockpit and quickly ran away from the plane. Stop reading now, and, after laying your book aside, think. We can anticipate your answers right now. "The pilot's actions were correct," says the cautious reader. "The situation was threatening the safety of the flight." "No," objects the thoughtful reader, "even though in itself such a situation did threaten the safety of the flight, the pilot did not have the right to abandon a disabled aircraft on the landing strip." "And what about the smoke that the pilot noticed behind the plane?" "That was more likely than not a cloud of steam from the kerosene that got on the heated turbine after the engine was shut down." Who is right? I suppose that you should go along with the evaluation of the thoughtful reader. And actually, if the pilot had looked at one more instrument after the false activation of the signal lights he would have seen that the oil pressure had not fallen and that there was no cause for hasty actions. The abandonment of a disabled aircraft on an airstrip created a dangerous situation for other pilots making landing approaches. It remains for us to explain why, then, the pilot was unable to correctly analyze the unexpected situation. "Inadequate familiarity with the equipment, insufficient training," quickly responds the cautious reader, without pondering, and he would be correct. "And insufficient psychological training," adds the thoughtful reader, and he would also be correct. The cause of hesitant, erroneous actions, as a rule, is a weak knowledge of the equipment. "That which I don't know, I fear" is a timeless truism, not only for pilots. But judge for yourself. Today aviation technology has become so complex that in order to service it, not to mention to correct malfunctions, as many as ten specialists are required, including engineers. Is it then within the powers of one pilot laboring under an acute deficit of time in flight to know the equipment well enough to instantly recognize the breakdown, its cause, and to make the sole correct decision? That is why there has long been and why the concept for aiding the pilot in decision-making in extraordinary situations brought on by the equipment itself continues to make inroads. We have already discussed in Chapter II onboard automated self-diagnostic systems and systems for correcting malfunctions, which support flight safety. Now it is important for us to explain why a person who has mastered equipment sometimes becomes flustered, bluntly put, why he acts incompetently if he has to act under difficult circumstances. There is little fuel in reserve, the weather conditions are harsh, the airfield is unfamiliar, a group air engagement is being conducted at low altitude, and in addition to the threat of crashing into the ground, there is the added threat of colliding with the other aircraft of the group, -- all of these external irritants can have a great influence on a pilot's psychological stability. We know of an incident where, under similar grave circumstances, the flight director gave the command over the radio "Eject!", but didn't give the radio call letters. Upon receiving this unaddressed command, a pilot for whom the message was not intended, abandoned his aircraft. We don't wish to bring the reader into the discussion of this situation. We leave it to the conscience of the flight director. But here is what comes from reading. You don't have safety unless you have an understanding of the actual danger. There isn't a pilot who has not been subjected to the emotional influence of extreme situations, and the behavior of each pilot is different. Some react calmly and confidently receive and analyze a quantity of information, which under normal circumstance would be impossible to process. Others lose their self-control, commit errors, their ability to perform is drastically decreased. Why? Perhaps the secret lies in the fact that they are inadequately trained. Not just that. In his time the famous Soviet pilot M. Gromov said: "In order to fly safely, it is very important to know how to comport oneself, how to overcome fatigue, uncertainty, and your own fear." And so, in striving to overcome ourselves, we stop to ponder two problems: what do we do to prevent the pilots' reactions from being dulled, so that their mental and psychological stability is not decreased when they find themselves in extreme conditions; how do we learn to engage in combat and conduct it while maintaining clearness of thought and level-headedness, not yielding to fear and weakness of will. When discussing these problems one must keep in mind the totality of the factors giving rise to psychological stress among flight personnel and to those factors, of a contrary nature, which contribute to mental and psychological conditioning (figure 42). Of course, the simplified picture does not convey the entire diversity of these factors. But in this case it is important to systematize only those factors which will be reflected in our story. In addition, one should not forget that a high degree of nervous psychological stress should not be considered only as a negative phenomenon for pilots. This is the normal reaction of any human being's body in response to an increase in the intensity of work or to the presence of danger. It is simply needed to mobilize the body's forces, to increase psychological and physical endurance. Figure 42. Moral and Psychlogical Factors. 2. Is Bravery Necessary in Air Combat? This question implies a simple answer: without bravery achieving victory over the enemy is unthinkable. However, not so long ago I happened to be an involuntary witness to a curious argument apropos this matter. Waiting to receive the command to depart, some pilots whiled away the time. After their encounter the day before with veterans of a unit which had participated in World War II, they were all impressed with the recollections of fearlessness, of the unprecedented bravery of the comrades in arms, of the heated dogfights in the skies on the front. "And anyway, the romance of such dogfights is gradually disappearing from our lives, and along with it bravery and valour," said the echelon commander, air force pilot 1st class Captain L. Ryzhkov. "Now in air combat you sometimes don't even see your enemy." "But is the enemy of today really less dangerous or less insidious than the fascist aces?" the other pilot tried to object. "And do you really think that less bravery is required today in order to achieve victory in combat?" "Combat conditions are not the same," Ryzhkov stubbornly continued. "Judge for yourself," he turned to ask for support from those around them listening with interest to the argument. "Like infantrymen meeting in hand to hand combat the fighters approached the enemy, penetrated into the very depth of the enemy's battle order, shooting down the Hitlerites at point blank range. Just as a lot less bravery is required of a soldier firing a rifle compared to one wielding a bayonet, the same is true of a pilot launching long-range missiles and destroying an air target before he sees it with his own eyes. That is why, first and foremost, our work requires a jeweller's precision in calculations, accurate aiming, actions which are perfected to the point that they are automatic, but by no means does it require bravery. Indeed, the concept of `bravery' is becoming meaningless." "You are forgetting about close maneuvering air engagements where the enemy is suddenly right in front of you..." "If you don't know how to competently conduct long-range combat," Ryzhkov ironically continued his colleague's thought. "But, why count on incompetence? I'll tell you something else," growing angry and not allowing anyone to voice his objections, he raised his voice. "As long-range weapons are developed, direct contacts with the enemy in all cases are disappearing, and along with them bravery and heroism." The command to depart interrupted the officer's speech and Captain L. Ryzhkov's pair took off to intercept an air target. The argument was not finished. Let's see how the pair's flight went. All the pilots' thoughts were concentrated on one thing: to find the "enemy" and to swiftly attack it. But the target went under cover of jamming and performed a hard maneuver. They were unsuccessful in guiding the fighters onto the target from the CP. Then the leading pair received the command to seek out the target on their own. It was not easy to find the target without help from the ground against the background of jamming, and it became even more difficult for the pilots when they detected the target in a place where they had not expected it at all. In order to get into the necessary position for attack the pair had to execute a series of drastic and complex maneuvers. Finally, in the fighters' sights the harmless sign of the target lit up steadily and they executed a "missile launch" at the given range. It looked like Ryzhkov, who had started the argument before the mission was flown, was right. The interception was difficult, but, in essence, everything came down to accurate work with the weapons radar, knowledge of piloting technique, and the use of well-known tactical methods. He rather accurately reflected the crux of the changes going on in aviational armaments. It is no longer necessary for aircraft crews armed with long-range missiles to approach the enemy to the point where there is visual contact. The battle can be completed at the point where earlier the approach had only begun. Of course, the inconclusiveness of the results of the attack assumes a high degree of responsibility on the part of the pilots for its success, but, on the other hand, the attacking aircraft is farther and farther away from the enemy. This creates an illusion of one's own safety and reduces the emotional stress. But, then, the enemy in this interception only defended himself, and the battle itself was a training exercise. Yes, the pilot in a long-range air battle does not see the enemy, but to make up for that he is under constant observation (remember the AWACS system) and there is the continuous threat of a sudden missile strike (the enemy also has new armaments). Such factors have broadened the spectrum and scale of dangerous situations considerably. Consider the state of a pilot who does not see the enemy, who can't act against it, but at any moment he expects a strike, and you will understand what a feeling of defenselessness he is experiencing, what psychological stress, what prolonged nervous tension is engendered by the invisible threat with which pilots must constantly clash. And everyone knows that the enemy will do everything in order "to blind" the interceptors with powerful radioelectronic countermeasures, to frustrate their strike from the maximum range, and the long-range engagement will develop into a close one, which Captain Ryzhkov has tried to discount. Having read Chapter II the reader already knows where close combat takes place. In spite of the omnipresence of radioelectronic equipment and the greater launching range of missiles, close combat will not only remain, but will find a wider range of usage. We will not repeat ourselves. One thing is clear: Contemporary combat requires decisive actions to the point of daring, but when faced with the enemy these give way to anxiety, doubt, and fear of responsibility for one's decisions. But if in a calm situation the pilot confidently flies his aircraft, acts perfectly, is considered a master of his business, it is still not known how he will conduct himself when he encounters the actual enemy. Won't it seem to him or won't he imagine that every step of the way danger is lying in wait for him, danger that in actuality is not that great? Usually people with these qualities do not act in the best manner. And so, is bravery a necessity in combat? Doubt in this engenders in the consciousness of people who are far from detached, the erroneous, but, obviously, for them convenient opinion that it is not all that necessary. Deception in itself is intolerable because it implies the underestimation of the enemy, and, moreover, cowardice. How then can one teach young pilots to suppress and block out fear and uncertainty, to develop the capacity for mental self-encouragement, self-control; how can bravery, or, in a broader sense, high levels of morale and aggressiveness in combat be taught? These questions are not synonymous. Here, as nowhere else, the limited nature of the old forms of combat training and the inertia of thought and of old habits have left their mark, and we are experiencing the results to this day. It must be confessed that not all that long ago we judged the development of the level of morale and aggressiveness in combat in extremely simplistic terms and with totally unjustified optimism. Who does not know that practice is needed to instill these qualities, that they are inculcated under difficult situations approximating combat activity? Nobody teaches as effectively as an enemy acting actively, daringly, and unexpectedly. The very circumstances force the pilots to mobilize all their powers and will for victory. A passive enemy, who carries out all of his tasks according to the book will not teach but will only create the impression that it is a relatively easy and simple task to achieve victory over him. But peacetime is not war where dangers are real and deadly. That is why we must not now avoid the specific conventions and limitations which are dictated by the strict rules of flight safety. To close one's eyes to that contradiction would be like an ostrich escaping danger by hiding its head in the sand. We have already run up against this situation when formulating tactics (see Chapter V) and we know how dearly this can cost. The most surprising thing is that the task of making the circumstances approximate combat activity does not have any obvious opponents. Everybody is "for" it. Numerous official directives, training manuals, and articles in military journals fight for this. So many impassioned statements have been made in the struggle with simplifications and indulgences made to the worn-out target for criticism. We'd like to avoid didactic instructions, but what can you do when you hear things over the radio like: "`Big', don't turn, we need a picture for the record." This "brave" pilot prevails upon the crew of the target aircraft that he is attacking and "big," curtailing the maneuver, shifts into horizontal flight. And so it happened that with the general approval of a very sound slogan, practically all the responsibility for fulfilling it was taken away from the commanders. It came to the point where the only criterion for their work was that their flight operations be accident-free and that they have a plan for attack. Alas, in itself a great "fake" attack still does not teach bravery, self-control, or presence of mind. The power of the inertia of thought and of conceptions which have formed over years is great. The stagnations, oversimplifications, and overcautiousness which have developed in the course of many years continue at times to be difficult to overcome in the quest to develop combat morale attributes among pilots. They are very much alive in our consciousness and traditional ideas. We are accustomed to using the well-worn words "bravery" and "courage" both in and out of place, to glibly rattle them off. In this way the essence of these very important ideas is devaluated, and then, the main sphere of activity of the commanders and political officers, their great personal responsibility for instilling their staff with high levels of morale and combat aggressiveness. We intentionally laid it on a little thick in order to show the entire complexity of the contradiction: safety through danger. How then do front line aviation commanders resolve this contradiction; how can they successfully put pilots in really difficult training situations? "In the regular forces soldiers roll around in tanks, missilemen have to their credit battle-noise simulators, smoke candles, tape recordings of the roar of diving aircraft, comprehensive training; in the radiotechnical troops morale and combat aggressiveness are taught using sudden radar jamming," one of the commanders told me not long ago. "But we aviators only have one way -- to simulate a complex air picture with all its difficult to resolve situations, but to simulate it so that it integrates tactics not only to train the crew professionally, but also in a mental and psychological sense. Without this close interdependence it would be impossible to instill the pilots with a sense of military duty, a belief in their powerful armaments, a will for victory, and finally, bravery. "As before, we thoroughly study the enemy, the tactical ruses he might employ, and his capabilities, but we put our main emphasis on elaborating models for combat situations with varying degrees of difficulty. We work tactical problems into them which enable the simulation of such emotional factors of an air battle as lack of time and information, novelty of the situation, its danger, uncertainty, and, in so doing, we control the pilots' mental and psychological stress. Such models which create an atmosphere of creative search, of justified risk, impel people to acts of courage and initiative. "The difficulties and dangers that pilots can encounter in battle are also reflected in the variants of combat actions which we have worked out. Perfecting these variants in practice flights, not breaking the rules of flight safety, we all understand that in battle it will be necessary to carry out missions under far more difficult circumstances. Persistence in achieving goals, keeness of wit, military cunning, the employment of comprehensive methods of a mental and psychological nature are in every way possible encouraged and advocated. Otherwise, our combat training will simply become tedious..." We will interrupt the commander's story, with which one can't help but agree, and turn to the concrete matters of his squadron. They are not at variance with his words. Here truly the kind of situation is created which requires the bravery and valour of the pilots. For example, in the squadron the rule has been laid down to "destroy the enemy" with the first attack. But how can this be achieved if the pilot does not approach the target undetected, if he is not able to execute a daring maneuver, if the attack itself is not daring and fulminant and the "enemy" does not have time to react to it? "The second attack might be the last for a fighter," a squadron commander in my presence told one of his pilots, who had complained about the mission being deliberately complicated. "Forget that the enemy here is simulated." Yes, destroying a target on the first attack is not a task for the timid. Here conditionalities are reduced to a minimum. The tension in the squadron is even greater when intercepting radio-controlled targets. The pilots know that after pressing the ordnance release button it is not a photographic target hit verification device that is put into action, but a missile which bursts out from under the wing towards the target. And if there is no cloud from the explosion bursting in the sky and the ground is not strewn with shapeless fragments, long after the fact you still have to put up with the scornful glances of the commander and your comrades. These training routines, somewhat similar to the routines on the front, show that bravery has not lost its meaning in our times either. No matter what heroic deeds the pilots perform, there is such bravery hidden behind that humdrum routine! The ability to withstand great mental and psychological overloads, maintain self-control and the readiness to take a risk -- all of this is bravery. And yet, bravery alone is of little worth, if it is not based on a profound knowledge of technology, if it is not bolstered to a great extent by tactics. It is not all that easy to achieve victory over the enemy of today. He is fairly well armed and trained. One must be able to take into consideration all aspects of the air picture, and to have skillful mastery of the armaments. Courage and readiness to perform a heroic deed are borne of persistent labor. Three-time Hero of the Soviet Union, Marshal of Aviation I. Kozhedub, said that he had been convinced many times: bravery without conditioning is like a blank round. If one lacks enthusiasm, then one lacks the desire to become a hero. This might be enough just for a brief flash, but not for a long persistent struggle, because a struggle is work, and work requires skill. But one cannot achieve victory over an enemy without bravery. Without bravery a pilot will not set out to perform a heroic deed. However, there is another type of bravery, when a man will fail to realize when danger is lying in wait for him or when the lack of ability to realistically evaluate the situation and his actions makes him fearless. This bravery comes from ignorance, it is an irrational, presumptuous bravery associated with vanity, with the desire to become famous, and that simply with dare-devil behavior. What fighter pilot is not familiar with the feeling of combat ardour, when before him is the powerful enemy, employing tactical ruses! The young pilot was seized by such ardour. He impetuously attacked the target and achieved victory. One circumstance, however, dampens our admiration. In the dust of the air battle he did not notice that he had created a G-force that exceeded the permissible limit -- his hands had been activated before his head had had time to think. "A genuine fighter pilot should fight bravely in battle," shouted the pilot, his voice breaking, at the post-flight critique when the commander upbraided him for a flagrant violation of the flight mission and the safety regulations. The commander stared at him. Anyone who has been in a similar situation knows that it is not necessary to say any more, but, nevertheless, he answered: "In your response there was more bravado than common sense. Bravery was turned into the most elementary ignorance. Certainly one can and must improvise in battle, since battle is fighting against opposition, but that kind of bravery only indicates that you do not know how to use your aircraft's advanced capabilities." Indeed, it is true. And today one comes across cases where the young pilot acting on the best motives wishes to immediately accomplish something heroic. Even the fear of punishment yields to the desire to confirm one's reputation as a daring air warrior. Alas, he does not yet have a real foundation under him: knowledge, skills, and tactical mastery. Such "bravery" of course is more than adequate for bragging, but not enough for an unrepulsble attack. And so, in answer to the question posed at the beginning of this section, we can say that bravery was and remains a most important component in the level of morale and combat aggressiveness of all aviators. Bayonet strikes in the past required a great deal of bravery, but less thought and calculation. The essence of training today is to teach a pilot to think tactically and to be brave in battle. This means that there is now a need to more fully realize the spiritual potential of a man -- the combat pilot, and on a higher level. 3. Logical Patterns and the Unexpected in the Morale-Psychological Sphere In the sky today there is no insidious enemy that would strive with unexpected attacks to overwhelm the psyche of pilots with surprise, to deprive them of hope for victory. Of course, flight on contemporary fighter aircraft, as has already been mentioned, is also associated with considerable mental and psychological stress. But much of what has been predicted here can be attributed to logical patterns, and falls into a logical order. However, these logical patterns do not always work in harmony; from time to time they are substituted by various unexpected phenomena. Which of our readers is not familiar with the situation which may be considered obvious: experiencing great mental and psychological stress, even well-trained pilots quickly become fatigued, their motor and intellectual reactions are reduced in a routine air situation, but especially in a difficult one. However, the opposite also happens: a pilot acts confidently in a difficult situation, and in a routine one commits blunders. What causes this? So that the blunder is not repeated, we must understand, we must analyze this unexpected phenomenon. Leaving the reader free rein for independent thought, we will turn to the authorities. Once the illustrious ace, Marshall of Aviation I. Kozhedub was asked: "When did the experienced combat pilots make mistakes on the front?" The answer was unexpected: "Often this happened under the most routine of conditions, because they let down their guard, they lost their vigilance, they did not follow the air situation as carefully." Actually, the history of World War II and other wars contains a host of similar examples. The same sorts of unexpected phenomena are also encountered in today's training routines. Those guilty of committing the errors are not novices but first class pilots whose experience should serve to perfect tactics. At the same time their less experienced colleagues, acting under the same conditions, successfully perform analogous missions. Our experienced pilots should not suspect me of being disrespectful of them. I always have been and will be an admirer of their mastery of flight, but the facts are stubborn things. On one of his flight days the experienced pilot, as always, confidently took his place in the cockpit of the aircraft and, after starting up the engine, flew off to intercept an air target. The takeoff, the approach to the designated intercept point -- everything went as usual. The pilot received the data for the attack from the CP, and there on the weapon radar display the target blip lit up. The target didn't maneuver, it wasn't covered by jamming, and, therefore, there was no doubt as to the pilot's success. The pilot, firmly knowing the procedure and the flight modes for interception and not considering the mission difficult, did not exhibit particular zeal. When he received the command from the CP he made some sluggish turns to the correct heading, and the remaining degrees, as they say, he made up mentally; almost mechanically he manipulated the switches of the weapons radar. And what happened? The inaccurate execution of the CP command, the lack of urgency, the carelessness, the sluggish maneuver when approaching the target not only hindered its interception, but almost caused a grave incident. Many at that time were puzzled as to why one of the most highly trained pilots, whose successes had become commonplace for everyone, suddenly committed errors which could only be forgiven of a lieutenant who had only just begun to master combat equipment. The answer to this riddle "suddenly" was concealed in the officer's overestimation of his own mental and psychological attributes ("I know everything, I can do anything"), in his insufficient responsibility for the performance of the mission assigned him. In actual fact he had solid skills in controlling both his aircraft and its armaments, but he did not know how to control his will or his emotions, and, what is particularly vexing, his excessive self-confidence and conceit undermined his hope for accumulated experience. The pilot crawled out of the cockpit in confusion and said only: "It's not necessary to convince me or educate me. I understood everything; skills have to be trained like muscles." Unfortunately this is not an isolated instance. The smallest inaccuracies and vexing blunders lead to the same negative results from a pilot's lack of psychological concentration. All you have to do is fall asleep at the switch for a second, lose control of your actions for an instant, and you end up in a situation that is disadvantageous for combat. Having detected the "enemy" and skillfully exploiting the conditions of the situation, the leader of a pair was able to approach the target undetected. Tactical superiority was achieved before the battle even started. Exploiting this advantage the leader decided to attack the target simultaneously with the pair from the left, but instead of the command "Attack from the left" over the radio he uttered "Attack from the right." It is true, the leader immediately corrected himself, but it was too late. The reader has probably already guessed what the outcome of the battle was. Correct: the supporting aircraft dawdled a little bit, the "enemy" saw the fighters and started a head-on maneuver. The battle was lost. The commander considered that the cause for this was the lack of discipline of the leader who violated the rules of radio communications. However, we can hardly agree with this. If his actions are referred to as undisciplined, then one must recognize them as conscious and deliberate. But that is really absurd. Just as in the previous episode, the cause of the defeat was the same: the leader became complacent, let down his guard, allowed his attention to stray and made a slip in his speaking. He had flown a lot, and courageously, but with time his fastidiousness had eroded, and he uncritically evaluated his training. Is it possible to reconcile with that when the pilot, instead of satisfying his tactical proficiency, which can always be improved, experiences a false sense of infallibility and allows carelessness when executing a maneuver or giving commands? It is human nature to make mistakes, but psychological mistakes are often deep-rooted and, therefore, very dangerous. They still need to be revealed and their causes need to be explained so that they can be counteracted with active preventative and educational measures. Sometimes the mistakes of experienced pilots are mentioned in passing, or not at all, so that their authority is not undermined in the eyes of their subordinates, sparing their self-esteem, hoping that the culprit himself will correct the "accidental" slip-up. From time to time such mistakes go totally "unnoticed," assuming that the fly won't really spoil the ointment. Then one can only console oneself with the fact that the negative experience in the given case was just as useful as a positive one, although that does not answer the question of what to do and how to do it in order to solve a new problem. And what about inexperienced pilots? With them the mistakes have other sources. Most often they result from lack of knowledge and know-how, which, as has already been mentioned, intensifies the feeling of uncertainty and gives rise to excessive tension. In order to spare oneself such mistakes, it is sufficient to do some additional course work and training sessions, and to carry out a few flights with an instructor. And here is one more seemingly obvious logical pattern: a rank of fighter pilots without a moment's hesitation agrees to carry out any mission, even the most difficult. What's wrong with that? The whole problem is that a pilot is untrained and incapable of fulfilling the flight mission, but he reports his readiness and then loses his presence of mind in flight, commits flagrant errors, and does not even accomplish the assigned task. Isn't his bravery deceitful? Indeed, because of it, not only does the interception of a, perhaps, very important target not take place, but the life of the interceptor is put in jeopardy! What is the cause? It is based on a sense of false shame. How do you voluntarily confess and tell the commander that you can't manage some difficult aerobatic figure or some air combat maneuver that is a piece of cake for your comrades? Do you waive your pride, become the target for sniping in the squadron, in the regiment? Pride, and sometimes an unfounded fear of falling into the category of "wimps" makes a pilot conceal his doubt a bit deeper within himself and urges him into the aircraft cockpit -- "maybe I can manage." If the flight has a satisfactory outcome, the pilot very rarely confesses as to what happened in the air. In one-man fighter aircraft, where the pilot is deprived of the advise and support of the other members of the crew, the sense of false shame is all the more dangerous. A pilot who is experienced, but who has had an inadmissibly long break in his flight activity was assigned the task of intercepting an air target and what happened was what one should have expected: the man did not notice that the G-force had increased beyond the permissible limit, he lost his head, and the aircraft fell into a spin. We will not now judge the decision of the commander who assigned this task which was beyond the pilot's capabilities. But the pilot himself understood very well that he might not be able to handle the assignment, but he was afraid to report this. If that had been the case, the officer would have been given additional training classes and some transport flights. His prestige would not have suffered as a result of this. I am not going to burden the reader by recounting other episodes where the sense of false shame stifled the voice of reason. I will only say that to recognize your own weakness is not easy and it is only within the power of men of principle who possess great strength of will. But this means that anyone who trains and leads pilots into combat must be a good psychologist, must understand the motives behind the actions of his men, must be very sensitive to those who, because of their own shyness or desire not to fall behind their colleagues, do not hasten to report their doubts. For example, after an air combat flight the pilot reports to the eschelon commander in detail what turned out better, what turned out worse, he complains that he was not able, as he would have liked, to attack the maneuvering "enemy": "I did everything as I was taught, but a headlong attack didn't work and I don't understand why." Of course, analysis of the performance monitoring and recording devices puts everything in perspective, and, meanwhile, judging by the pilot's report, the cause of the failure lies in his indecisiveness and sluggish maneuver when approaching the target. "I'm fed up with sickly people!", the indignant commander grumbled aloud. "They don't have enough assertiveness, they're afraid of being overworked." The eschelon commander, the mentor and advisor came down on the pilot for whom something had not worked out during the flight, who had not been able to find the cause of the setback. It could be that the officer really was rather afraid of being overworked, but could there be another reason? Then -- a mutual enmity, the pilot's uncertainty about his own capabilities. And all around are the subordinates -- witnesses of this peculiar analysis of the flight. But even without being a psychologist, one can predict that hardly a one of them now feels like telling the commander about his difficulties, confessing his doubts, even if he had to, and the doubts remain. Without confidence in people, without comradery, the commander cannot achieve mutual psychological understanding with his men, and they cannot analyze the reasons for their doubts and mistakes. Can it be that these unexpected phenomena, which we have exposed and traced in the morale and psychological plane, are the inevitable costs of various human temperaments which can be smoothed and concealed, but not totally neutralized? No, these unexpected phenomena confirm a position that has been known for a very long time concerning the preventive study and calculation of factors (figure 42). A surprising fact: in order to understand how an airplane flies, the laws of aerodynamics are taught, but in order to understand how a pilot flies, it is not considered obligatory to teach the laws of psychology. And sometimes these factors, which would seem at first glance to be common knowledge, are scorned. But indeed within them are concealed a series of purely psychological moments, promoting the assimilation of new equipment, the perfection of tactical mastery. * * * A man in combat should know how to overcome all difficulties and dangers. But he is overcoming not only these, but also himself. In order to manage his own will, emotions, and consciousness it is necessary first of all to understand himself. Imagine yourself in the role of a young, energetic pilot. You are pondering an upcoming difficult flight. You want to objectively evaluate the dangers, to overcome your sense of fear of the unknown, to feel a sense of confidence in your own strengths. Who, but you yourself, can better judge you in all strictness and frankness, remembering that bravery and courage can be taught. And you, commander, before a flight look at each pilot. Eyes in a wide open stare, the brows knit or, on the contrary, raised high -- this is the typical expression of a face showing excessive tension. Will you be able to count on this pilot in combat? It is just not necessary to reproach him for timidity or uncertainty if he himself is trying to overcome these qualities in himself. OVERT AND UNDISCLOSED SECRETS Before the book comes to a close, let's leaf through its pages and sum up what we've read. What does it mean to master the secrets of unrepulsable attacks? This is a book of overt secrets. The principle of its structure was revealed in the first pages. This principle recognizes completely the complex multi-faceted phenomena of tactics and the practical realization of the results achieved. To master the secrets of unrepulsable attacks means: --to be able to predict the course of events, to correctly analyze the expected situation, to prudently plan the engagement, to develop and employ tactical methods in various combinations; --to be familiar with and take full advantage of the capabilities of your armaments, to quickly make the correct decisions for their employment in combat; --to be able to use military strategems in order to make the enemy act in a way that is to your advantage and to be able to turn the course of the battle in the required direction; --not to procrastinate in making decisions and taking actions, to look for and find reserves to win time when preparing for the flight and in combat; --to competently manage the engagement from the ground and in the air, creatively combining the wealth of potential of the automated guidance systems with tactical thought; --to possess a high level of psychological stability and everyday morale so that one does not waver in extreme flight situations and in combat with a strong enemy. There are no secrets in these essentially well-known positions, but if you do not strive to grasp them, it means that you won't master the secrets of unrepulsable attacks. But that is not all. How do you relate to innovations in tactics, what are you pondering? Tactics is a creative matter. That is why, from time to time, secrets occur that still need to be grasped. The development of the tactics of fighter aviation entailed quite a few steep turns. Part of what has been achieved has been rejected, but as a result there has been a great return. Reading the book and following its development, you have seen how some methods of military action and tactic procedures have died out or been thrown out, and others have been restored to life on a new technical foundation. Not everything that was successful in combat yesterday is applicable today, but much remains unchanged. For example, in the course of many decades attacks from the side of the sun have played a significant role in fighter tactics. They have enabled aircraft to approach the enemy undetected, and climbing in the direction of the sun made it possible to break away from the enemy. Radar weapons aiming systems and guided missiles have supposedly brought about an unconventional form of camouflage using the sun. But, it turns out, that with the appearance of heat-seeking missiles, deviation toward the sun, which for them is jamming, has once again become an effective tactical method. Or, let's turn to weapons and attacks on head-on courses. There was a time when daring "suicide" pilots who had worked for these attacks with the emergence of missiles were ridiculed. What an anachronism, they say, in an age of supersonic jet technology. But attacks on a head-on course have not only experienced a revival, but they are the basis of long-range air engagements, and to make wisecracks sounds more like a limp joke. Such is the incessant movement of tactical thought. Each generation of commanders and pilots reveals the secrets of unrepulsable attacks in its own way, based on a broader sphere of knowledge and its own comprehension. We go forward, we accumulate tactical wisdom, but aviation technology is perfected, the air enemy changes, and the secrets remain. The tactical methods found by us withstand with ever greater difficulty the test of time. Even in the time it took to publish this book, some of what has been said in it is already outdated; it now belongs to the past, and the future is reality. Therefore, in spite of the variety of the existing methods, we must constantly and urgently uncover the new secrets of unrepulsable attacks and seek ways to achieve victory over a strong, intelligent, and brutal enemy. These secrets are part of the eternal problems of tactics. No matter how much has been said and written about them, they will never be exhausted. Something else is evident. Good tactical ideas can be discredited by a weak material base which does not satisfy the tactical requirements. There are also facts of another sort, of an, as we say, "local significance." Occupied with the everyday pressures of work, we unfortunately continue to think in outmoded terms, to employ tactical methods of days gone by, and in order to theoretically justify that way of acting, we allude to the rich experience of the past. But attempts to cling to old experience by calling it combat tradition signifies a stagnation in tactics. That's when "blank spaces" occur where, based on sound reflection, they shouldn't be. But we're not talking about those "blank spaces" here. Unexposed secrets (the reader also encountered them on the pages of the book) are an objective logical pattern of tactics. Which aspects of today will be transferred into the future? Which combat action methods promise the greatest success? These are serious questions, and you don't have to be particularly astute to predict that the answers to them won't be specific enough. Alas, the science of tactics does not reveal its secrets that easily. Let's just consider this: there are secrets that in the meantime have not been fully revealed. Ahead of us are numerous studies, calculations, generalizations of experience, the development of hypotheses, and the definition of their details. One thing is certain: we must seek out ways to understand unrevealed secrets even with the most long-term perspective in complex situations of conflict, in a cunning interlacing of combat maneuvers. Looking into the future of fighter aviation tactics, we will see pilots conducting combat on unfamiliar aircraft, employing armaments and electronic warfare means which are unknown to us. The enemy's aircraft and armaments will be unfamiliar. What will be familiar is the bravery and courage, the combat activity and initiative, and the tactical training of the fighter pilots. They will remain that crystal ball through which the entire dialectic of the secrets of unrepulsable attacks is viewed. COPYRIGHT: A.B. Krasnov
