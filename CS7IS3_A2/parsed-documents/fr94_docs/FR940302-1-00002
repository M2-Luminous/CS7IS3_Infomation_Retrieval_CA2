FR940302-1-00002 FR940302-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 9 CFR Part 78 [Docket No. 93&hyph;120&hyph;1] Official Brucellosis Tests AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: We are proposing to amend the brucellosis regulations by revising standards established for the brucellosis testing of cattle and bison with the particle concentration fluorescence immunoassay test. By revising the standards for this test, we believe we would help designated epidemiologists to avoid incorrectly classifying cattle and bison as brucellosis suspects. DATES: Consideration will be given only to comments received on or before May 2, 1994. ADDRESSES: Please send an original and three copies of your comments to Chief, Regulatory Analysis and Development, PPD, APHIS, USDA, room 804, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782. Please state that your comments refer to Docket No. 93&hyph;120&hyph;1. Comments received may be inspected at USDA, room 1141, South Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays. Persons wishing to inspect comments are requested to call ahead on (202) 690&hyph;2817 to facilitate entry into the comment reading room. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. John Kopec, Senior Staff Veterinarian, Cattle Diseases Staff, Veterinary Services, APHIS, USDA, room 730, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;6188. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Brucellosis is a serious infectious and contagious disease, caused by bacteria of the genus Brucella, that affects animals and man. The Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to cooperate with the States in conducting a brucellosis eradication program and in preventing the interstate spread of brucellosis. The regulations in 9 CFR part 78 (referred to below as the regulations) govern the interstate movement of cattle, bison, and swine in order to help prevent the spread of brucellosis. Official brucellosis tests are used to determine the brucellosis status of cattle, bison, and swine. The regulations stipulate that testing negative to an official brucellosis test is a condition for certain interstate movements. Additionally, official tests are used to determine eligibility for indemnity payments for animals destroyed because of brucellosis. One official test is the particle concentration fluorescence immunoassay (PCFIA) test, an automated serologic test for brucellosis in cattle, bison, and swine. Results of the PCFIA test are expressed as an S/N value, which is the ratio of the test sample to a negative control. Currently, under the definition of Official test in ยง78.1(a)(10) of the regulations, cattle and bison are considered: (1) reactors when the S/N value of their PCFIA test results is less than or equal to 0.25; (2) suspects when the S/N value is greater than or equal to 0.26, but less than or equal to 0.70; and (3) negative when the S/N value is greater than 0.70.
