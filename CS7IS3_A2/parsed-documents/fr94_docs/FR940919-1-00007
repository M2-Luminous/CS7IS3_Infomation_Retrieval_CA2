FR940919-1-00007 FR940919-1-00003 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;CE&hyph;54&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Cessna Aircraft Company Engine Oil Filter Adapters, Part Numbers 0450404&hyph;1, 0450404&hyph;3, 0556004&hyph;1, 0556010&hyph;1, 1250403&hyph;6, 1250922&hyph;1, and 1250922&hyph;2, Installed on Aircraft AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) that would apply to Cessna Aircraft Company (Cessna) engine oil filter adapters, part numbers 0450404&hyph;1, 0450404&hyph;3, 0556004&hyph;1, 0556010&hyph;1, 1250403&hyph;6, 1250922&hyph;1, and 1250922&hyph;2, installed on aircraft. The proposed action would require applying torque paint between the engine filter adapter assembly, nut, and oil pump housing; inspecting the oil filter and adapter assembly for oil leakage and proper installation of the adapter retaining nut and fretting of associated threads (security), and replacing any oil filter and adapter assembly with oil leakage or security problems; and repetitively inspecting the torque paint for cracks or misalignment, and reinspecting the oil filter and adapter assembly if torque paint cracks or misalignment is found. Reports of loose or separated engine oil filter adapters on several airplanes prompted the proposed action. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent loss of engine oil caused by loose or separated oil filter adapters, which could result in engine stoppage while in flight and loss of control of the airplane. DATES: Comments must be received on or before November 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;CE&hyph;54&hyph;AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106.
