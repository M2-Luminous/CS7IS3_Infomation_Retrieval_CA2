However, the United States has reached a consensus with the ROK and Japan: Even if a resolution on imposing economic sanctions against the DPRK is not adopted by the UN Security Council, the United States, the ROK, and Japan will impose sanctions unilaterally. The United States has even asserted that it will go it alone in imposing sanctions at any cost if other countries are not willing to join in. The ROK has held a supreme security conference, and has ordered its air, naval, and ground forces to be put on alert. According to Pyongyang, sanctions adopted by the UN Security Council will be tantamount to a "declaration of war," which will lead to inestimable consequences. The United States, the ROK, and Japan all expect China to play an important role in the tense situation on the Korean peninsula, that is, to "persuade" Pyongyang to accept the IAEA inspections. Russia, which also has influence on the DPRK, is against economic sanctions and hopes that an international conference attended by the countries concerned can be held to resolve the problem through consultations. Regarding China, its central leaders have told other countries not to place too much hope on China's influence on Pyongyang. China's basic position is that it supports the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and hopes that talks will be held to settle the question of the DPRK accepting international nuclear inspections arranged by the United Nations. While meeting with a DPRK military delegation led by Chief of Staff Choe Kwang yesterday, President Jiang Zemin emphasized Sino-DPRK friendship and said that "the parties and armies of China and the DPRK share traditional friendly relations. Whether in the past or at present, it has been of great significance to further enhancing and developing such friendly ties." The purpose of the DPRK military delegation's visit to China at a time when the situation on the peninsula is tense is to show the United States, the ROK, and other countries that Sino-DPRK relations, including military ties, are still good. Naturally, China and DPRK have maintained good neighborly relations for a long time. As neighbors, the continuity of their friendly ties benefits both sides. Jiang Zemin did not make any public statement on the DPRK nuclear question. Apparently, the situation on the Korean peninsula is still developing and changing. China is against compelling Pyongyang to give in. Even the question of nuclear inspections should be resolved through dialogue and consultations. Pressure will only aggravate and complicate the situation on the Korean peninsula. Russia is more or less inclined to China's position. As a matter of fact, the international community should calmly evaluate whether the DPRK is capable economically, financially, or technologically to quickly produce an atomic bomb. At a time when the United States, Russia, and Ukraine are in deep trouble concerning the destruction and reduction of their nuclear warheads and rockets following the end of the Cold War, why should the DPRK, whose economic situation is very grim, develop an A-bomb? Would the people support it? It seems that the United States has been a little too sensitive on the DPRK nuclear issue, which has also affected Japan and the ROK. However, they have neglected the popular will of the Korean peninsula, which tends toward reconciliation and the reunification of North and South Korea. The facts and achievements attained by China since reform and opening up was introduced 15 years ago have exerted an influence on the DPRK, and Vietnam's open policy is also producing a good effect on the DPRK. A plan proposed by the United Nations to establish an international development zone in the Tumen Delta, which borders China, the DPRK, and Russia, in order to promote the economic development of all Northeast Asia was well received and supported by China, Japan, the ROK, Mongolia, the United States, and even Finland in northern Europe. The DPRK is also willing to turn its Chongjin and Rajin ports into open ports for the international development zone. This shows that the DPRK intends to open itself to the outside world. From a long-term perspective, the Korean peninsula will be reunified. This is an irresistible historical trend. If, at this moment, one only knows how to step up pressure and impose sanctions at every turn, it will be difficult for a sovereign state to accept this. It is better to settle problems through dialogue and negotiations. As measures to isolate a country usually have the opposite results, they are not recommended. While meeting with the Maltese prime minister yesterday, Qian Qichen said that China maintains its position on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. China hopes that the DPRK nuclear issue can be settled through talks held between the three sides and four parties. Sanctions are not good at resolving problems as they only intensify problems. It is necessary for China to reconcile and mediate in the DPRK nuclear deadlock inside and outside the UN Security Council. The best option is to calmly analyze the causes of the problems on the Korean peninsula and to resolve these problems through patient and peaceful talks. There is an ancient Chinese saying: "He who cannot forbear in small matters spoils great undertakings." In the face of the tense situation on the Korean peninsula today, the parties concerned should think further about China's proposal.
