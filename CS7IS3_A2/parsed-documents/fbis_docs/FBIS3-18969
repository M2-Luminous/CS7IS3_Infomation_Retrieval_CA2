Talks with the industries affected and the social partners should be initiated as soon as possible. At a joint news conference after the cabinet meeting, Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek stressed that the most important thing is to make it clear to the citizens that all required measures are being introduced at full speed. Vranitzky spoke of a "clear signal," and Busek described this signal as the precondition for making use of the economic opportunities that the European Union offers. Both Vranitzky and Busek spoke in favor of making available the required financial funds to accelerate restructuring, even though this would result in a higher budget deficit. For Vranitzky, this is a kind of "payment on account" for an improvement of the economy and for a higher tax revenue expected to result therefrom. Busek clearly prefers "using the funds for measures that promote developments instead of financing unemployment." The government's declaration of principle explicitly notes that the "integration of Austria's agriculture into the Common Agricultural Policy will by no means be a shock because measures will be taken--financed by the European Union, the provinces, and the government--which will, in the long run, ensure the existence of the farmers and the processing industry." The government also stressed the special significance of a solution to the transit problem. Thus, the declaration of principle mentions Austria's intention "to ensure the environmental goals of the transit agreement on a permanent basis beyond the duration of the agreement by shifting quickly and to a greater extent traffic from the roads to the railways. For this reason, the Austrian Government advocates the expansion of railway lines on the transit routes. In this respect, the quick expansion of the railway line in the Unterinntal valley and the construction of the Brenner tunnel, for which the European Union has promised funds, assumes great significance." The government's goal is to strengthen Austria's competitiveness with a view to entry into the European Union. The declaration of principle was jointly presented to the cabinet by Vranitzky and Busek. The head of government and his deputy proposed shifting freight traffic quickly from the roads to the railways, particularly in Tirol. Even without membership in the European Union, Austria would have had to tackle this problem. It is now important to make use of the promised funds of the European Union. Referring to the Unterinntal valley railway tunnel, Vranitzky expressed the conviction that the government formed after the provincial elections will accept his governments's offer for early talks. In fact, Governor Wendelin Weingartner threatened to reject the European Union unless Tirol's interests are taken into consideration. Yet he, Vranitzky, considered it more useful to respond to this statement with an offer for talks. Since the Austrian railways are currently in the process of planning the Unterinntal valley line, details of the tunnel should be coordinated with Tirolean authorities as soon as possible. Busek stressed that these railway projects are very labor-intensive and will ensure jobs. Moreover, Weingartner has also made it clear that EU membership also offers numerous opportunities for Tirol. The possibilities of a transit solution are "closer than ever before." As a result of EU membership, the border between north and south Tirol will "largely be removed." Busek is convinced that, also from Weingartner's point of view, the advantages of EU membership outweigh the disadvantages. Busek also emphasized the fact that various foreign companies make investments dependent on Austria's EU membership. This will provide additional stimulus for the economy. According to Vranitzky, the exact date of the referendum on the European Union cannot be determined at this point because it also depends on talks within the European Union -- on the blocking minority, for example. Whether it will be held on 12 or 19 June will also depend on the parliamentary schedule. Transportation Minister Klima stated that, even without the Brenner tunnel, a four-track railway line is required in the Unterinntal valley because short-distance traffic is already creating problems at this point. The section between Woergl and Innsbruck is particularly critical where two railway lines meet -- the Inntal valley line and the line to Bischofshofen. The financing procedure will ultimately depend on the estimated costs, and these in turn will depend on the wishes of the neighboring communes concerning the route. In individual sections, deviations form the planned route would double the costs. The railway head office in Innsbruck has for months been holding talks on the route with the neighboring communes. The feasibility study of the Brenner tunnel, which is being prepared under the leadership of a general consultant, will be completed by June this year, Klima stated. A decision will be made in October when, how fast, and whether the Brenner tunnel will be built at all. In the spirit of the agreement with the European Union, the project will be financed out of the federal budget and EU funds. During a short visit to Tirol, Foreign Minister Alois Mock announced on Tuesday that he will support the provision of EU funds for the railway tunnel in the Unterinntal valley. Mock was "optimistic" that he will be able to achieve the same kind of support that was promised for the Brenner tunnel. Tirol Governor Wendelin Weingartner stressed once more that Tirol's "yes" to the European Union will depend on binding promises concerning the financing of the Unterinntal valley railway line. He welcomed the cabinet's decision on the expansion of the railway network as a step in the right direction. His deputy Hans Tanzer described Weingartner's threatening gestures as superfluous. Tirol can rely on Chancellor Vranitzky and the Federal Government. Joerg Haider, chairman of the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe], criticized Weingartner's talks with the government as a "spectacle" and a "political maneuver designed to deceive the citizens." Whereas the government headed by Vranitzky has adopted another "halfhearted declaration of principle" without presenting specific plans and figures concerning the expansion of the railway network, Tirol is being increasingly neglected, the opposition leader pointed out. The FPOe will hold a special conference on the European Union in Villach on 8 April. Catholic Action has published a memorandum as an aid for the decision on the European Union but did not recommend a specific position.
