On June 23 after the document is coordinated in all ten languages of the contracting parties, it will be initialled by the heads of the delegations participating in the talks, the Russian Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations told Interfax. The signing ceremony will take place in the Church of Saint George on the Greek island of Corfu on June 24 at 10:00 in the morning. The agreement will be signed by the Russian president and the EU leadership. Deputy Chief of the Department of Multilateral Cooperation under the Russian Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations Maksim Medvedkov stressed that it had taken two years of tense talks to complete the agreement. For instance, the unwillingness of the EU to improve the conditions for Russian goods entering its markets was quite a problem. Discord concerning export of Russian uranium and activities of EU banks in Russia also hampered the talks. The present talks helped to resolve these issues in general. The agreement provides for mutual application of the basic principles of GATT in trade with certain exception made for nuclear materials on which a separate agreement will be concluded by 1997. A total of five EU banks which were given authorization for operations with Russian residents but failing to use it due to a presidential decree restricting activities of foreign banks issued in November, 1993, will be given their rights back. In what concerns other banks, during the period of transition Russia will keep the right to apply to them certain restrictions defined by the agreement. In particular, the agreement said that the share of foreign capital in the banking system of Russia must not exceed 12 pct. The restrictions also concern the number of branches of foreign banks and their right for operations with residents. Medvedkov stressed that the agreement on partnership and cooperation between Russia and the EU provided for gradual integration of the Russian economy with the single European economic space. The principles used within the scope of the EU for the free movement of goods, capital and services and of establishment of companies and their activities, will be step by step implemented in the countries which have joined the agreement. The EU is the biggest economic partner for Russia. The share of the trade turnover with the EU is 35 pct of Russia's trade turnover with the far abroad. The share of the EU in Russian export is 36 pct.
