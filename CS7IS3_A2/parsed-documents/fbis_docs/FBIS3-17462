Yuri Matochkin, head of the region's administration, suggested to simplify transit document regulations to firms and organizations that would be vouched for by the Kaliningrad administration. The Lithuanian side accepted the proposal. Lithuania and the region also agreed to put off for three months the introduction of Lithuanian visas for Kaliningrad residents because the region is technically unprepared to make special passport inserts for travel through Lithuanian territory.
