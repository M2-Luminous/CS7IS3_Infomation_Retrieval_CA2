Korean Authorities' Scheme To Take Away Koreans From Sakhalin" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, February 24 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of the Red Cross Society of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea released a statement on February 24 denouncing the crafty and insidious scheme of the South Korean authorities to take Korean residents in Sakhalin, Russia, to South Korea in conspiracy with the Japanese Government as a treacherous act selling off the dignity and interests of the nation for a few amount of money. The South Korean authorities, absurdly contending that the issue of Korean residents in Sakhalin had been a political one but it is now purely a humanitarian issue, revealed their intention to settle this issue by receiving a few amount of money from the Japanese Government as traveling expenses for their immigration, the statement says: The residence of Koreans in Sakhalin resulted from the fact that when the Japanese imperialists illegally occupied Korea, they forcibly took them away by issuing an outrageous "general mobilization order" and overdrove them before leaving them in Sakhalin. The Japanese Government has neither officially apologized to the Korean people nor compensated for Japan's past crimes. Then, how can the problem suddenly become a mere humanitarian problem, losing its political nature? The problem of Koreans taken to the Far East by the Japanese imperialists is not a matter confined to the 40,000 Koreans resident in Sakhalin but a serious matter which can be solved only when the Japanese Government make an apology and compensation to nearly 500,000 Koreans who are living in the former Soviet Union. Our nation has the right in view of the international law to get an apology and claim compensation from the Japanese Government for the national misfortune and sufferings experienced by all the Koreans overseas, not to speak of those living scattered in the former Soviet Union, for nearly one whole century. This notwithstanding, the South Korean rulers, under the humanitarian [word indistinct] have launched a deceptive "charity" offensive among the Sakhalin-resident Koreans. This is motivated by a sinister intention to [words indistinct] "foundation" in the Far East of Russia and foster discord and confrontation within the nation by winning over them, thus perpetuating the division of the country. As all Koreans overseas who visited South Korea confirmed, the South Korean society, a corrupt and ailing society where the rich is getting richer and the poor poorer, provides no political and economic guarantee for the life of those who return to South Korea from foreign countries. We believe that all the Koreans in Russia and other areas (?of the) former Soviet Union will rise up as one in the staunch struggle to reject the insidious and crafty moves of South Korean and Japanese authorities to bring them to South Korea and defend the dignity and interests of the nation. Our nation will settle scores to the last for all the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists in the past and will never pardon the traitors who are selling the interests of the nation to Japan, courting its favor. The South Korean and Japanese authorities must be mindful that if they persistently resort to base plots to bring Sakhalin-resident Koreans to South Korea, ignoring our solemn warning, they will by no means evade the possibility for such a crime as insulting and abusing the noble humanitarian idea and will bring a greater disgrace to themselves under the eyes of the world.
