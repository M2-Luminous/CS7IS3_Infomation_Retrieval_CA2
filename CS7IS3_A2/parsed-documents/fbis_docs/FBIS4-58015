In an interview on Radio Metropole, Saint-Louis said the Jonassaint government will not permit the return of the group which was dissolved in 1986. He recalled that the Haitian Constitution authorizes only the Army and the police as armed corps. Saint-Louis urged the people to remain alert in case of a foreign invasion, however. Franck Pierre, of the Capois La Mort organization (on Army salary), asked General Raoul Cedras, commander of the Haitian Armed Forces, to decree a general mobilization to face the foreign threat. Pierre also asked Cedras to reintegrate retired officers and soldiers of the Armed Forces to form a "Grand Military Council" and put the country on a war footing. The leader of the extreme right organization urged Cedras to request Parliament and the president de facto to declare a state of siege in the country. Meanwhile, the announcement about the resurging of the Tonton Macoutes continues sparking reactions from political leaders. Reynold Georges, of the (center-right) Alliance for the Liberation of Haiti, said the announcement is "a violation of and an injury to" the Constitution. Eddy Volel, of the (center-left) Reunion of Christian Democrats, said that with this maneuver, the military will provoke a civil war in the country.
