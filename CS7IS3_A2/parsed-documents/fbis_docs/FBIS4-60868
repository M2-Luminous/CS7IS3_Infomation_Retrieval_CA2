The draft provides for dividing Georgia into 12 territories, Abkhazia and Ajaria among them, though with a special political status. This provision does not relate to South Ossetia. In the meantime, as Interfax learned from reliable sources, the Georgian leadership is planning to hold talks with the present South Ossetian administration concerning the political status of that territory. On instructions from Eduard Shevardnadze a special group was formed to conduct these talks. The talks are to take place in mid May.
