At a press conference after the talks, representatives stressed the consensus-forming nature of the discussions, and also that the opposition parties received greater participation in the various committees than they were entitled to by election percentages. During the May elections, six parties won seats in the 386-member Parliament: the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP; 54.15 percent -- 209 MPs [members of parliament]), the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ; 17.87 -- 69 MPs), the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF; 9.84 -- 38 MPs), the Independent Smallholders' Party (FKGP; 6.74 -- 26 MPs), the Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP; 5.7 -- 22 MPs), and the Federation of Young Democrats (Fidesz: 5.18 -- 20 MPs). The Hungarian Socialist Party and the Alliance of Free Democrats are expected to form a governing coalition. The speaker of Parliament will be an MSZP politician, and the three deputy speaker posts will be filled by SZDSZ, MDF and FKGP politicians respectively, based on election results. The SZDSZ, MDF and the FKGP will be able to nominate one notary each, with the KDNP and FIDESZ receiving two notary posts each. The negotiating delegations also agreed that the new parliament would have 17 committees. Six particularly important committees will have 27 members: the Constitutional, the Budget, the Local Government, the Foreign Affairs, the Economic, and the Agricultural Committees. The Defence, the Welfare, the Environmental Protection, the Cultural, the Human Rights, and the Educational Committees will have 19 members each, with 15 MPs in the European Integration Committee, and 13 MPs each in the Auditing, Employment, and Labour Committees. The National Security Committee will have 9 members. The Immunity and Mandate Committee will have 8 MPs. Under the new parliamentary committee system, there will be a total of 334 committee members. An agreement was also reached regarding the distribution of committee chairmen and deputy chairmen. Accordingly, the MSZP will chair 9 committees; the SZDSZ, three; and the opposition parties, five. The opposition parties will control 12 deputy committee chairman posts instead of the 9 due to them according to the numeric proportion of votes which they received. The MSZP will chair the Economic, the Welfare, the Environmental Protection, the Cultural and Press, the Human Rights, the Educational, the Agricultural, the Audit, and the Immunity and Mandate Committees. The SZDSZ will chair the Constitutional, the Foreign Affairs, and the Defence Committees. The MDF will provide the chairman for the Budget and Financial, and the National Security Committees. The FKGP has received the chairmanship of the Local Government Committee, a KDNP MP will chair the Employment and Labour Committee, and an Fidesz MP will preside over the European Integration Committee.
