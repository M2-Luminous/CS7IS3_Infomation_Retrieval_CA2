In an interview published in the daily IZVESTIYA Friday, Panov said Moscow would support the U.N. Security Council in adopting a resolution demanding outside inspection of North Korea's nuclear facilities. Commenting on his earlier statement that Russia would have to intervene automatically to militarily assist North Korea under a bilateral treaty if North Korea was attacked, Panov said his remark had been distorted by the press. The Russian position on the military assistance treaty between the former Soviet Union and North Korea has not changed from what it was a year ago, he said. Panov said Russia would decide whether to fulfill its obligations under the 1961 treaty with North Korea after considering the differences between then and now and analyzing the situation on the basis of Russia's national interest, while bearing in mind its international obligations including the non-proliferation treaty. Panov stressed there is no threat of any unprovoked attack on North Korea at present, thus hinting that Moscow has no ground for providing military support to Pyongyang, the newspaper said. Russia tries to make use of the Korean situation to strengthen its position in Asia, the paper said. But Russia does not want a conflict with Seoul and Washington over this issue, it said, noting that Russia, unlike China, is ready to support a UN Security Council resolution on North Korea.
