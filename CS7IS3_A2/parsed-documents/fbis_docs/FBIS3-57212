She described Demyanov's actions as "illegal and destructive," referring to his giving Agriculture and Food Minister Yuriy Karasik his personal consent to using the American chemical "Harness" in the republican agriculture. She said "such a connivance allowed the American company "Monsanto" to fetch in 2,000 tons of this chemical which is not even registered in the U.S.A. and is banned for use in Ukraine." She also said a criminal case was filed against "state officials of the Agriculture and Health Care ministries" on the fact of the acquisition of this chemical and production of banned chemicals in Ukraine. In an interview with Interfax-Ukraine, Kolinko said "Ukraine has become a test site for foreign companies where they test their chemicals, and moreover, directly on the fields." "Monsanto" representative in Kiev, Vladimir Kudryashov, told Interfax-Ukraine that "they did sell some quantity of "Harness" to Ukrainian consumers." He said "had the chemical not been used last year, Ukraine would not have had such a rich harvest of corn." At the same time, he added that the company's office in Kiev will sell the chemical only after its registration in the republic, supposedly this February or March.
