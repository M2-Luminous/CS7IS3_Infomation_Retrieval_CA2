FR940728-0-00043 FR940728-0-00015 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 9 [FRL&hyph;5022&hyph;2] OMB Approval Numbers Under the Paperwork Reduction Act AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Technical amendment. SUMMARY: In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, this document adds the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control numbers issued under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) for Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles and New Motor Vehicle Engines; Regulations Requiring On-Board Diagnostic Systems on 1994 and Later Model Year Light-Duty Vehicles and Light-Duty Trucks. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule is effective August 29, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Todd Sherwood, Certification Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2565 Plymouth Road, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105, Telephone (313) 668&hyph;4405. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA is today amending the table of currently approved information collection request (ICR) control numbers issued by OMB for various regulations. Today's amendment updates the table to accurately display those information requirements promulgated under the on-board diagnostics (OBD) final rulemaking which appeared in the Federal Register on February 19, 1993 (58 FR 9468). The affected regulations are codified at 40 CFR part 86. EPA will continue to present OMB control numbers in a consolidated table format to be codified in 40 CFR part 9 of the Agency's regulations, and in each CFR volume containing EPA regulations. The table lists the section numbers with reporting and recordkeeping requirements, and the current OMB control numbers. This display of the OMB control number and its subsequent codification in the Code of Federal Regulations satisfies the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq .) and OMB's implementing regulations at 5 CFR 1320. This ICR was previously subject to public notice and comment prior to OMB approval. As a result, EPA finds that there is ``good cause'' under section 553(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)) to amend this table without prior notice and comment. Due to the technical nature of the table, further notice and comment would be unnecessary. List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 9 Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Dated: July 15, 1994. Carol M. Browner, Administrator. For the reasons set out in the preamble, part 9 of 40 CFR chapter I is amended as follows: PART 9_[AMENDED] 1.
