FBIS4-10554 "drlat072_m_94009" FBIS-LAT-94-072 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 Brazil Police Dismantles Nigerian Cocaine Connection Police Dismantles Nigerian Cocaine Connection PY1404011894 Rio de Janeiro Rede Manchete Television in Portuguese 2300 GMT 13 Apr 94 PY1404011894 Rio de Janeiro Rede Manchete Television Portuguese BFN [Text] Federal Police have begun to break up the Nigerian cocaine connection. Police believe that nearly a metric ton of cocaine per year still leaves Brazil and is taken to Nigeria. Following a year of investigations, Federal Police unveiled the daring African cocaine trafficking scheme. The drug leaves Bolivia, is sold in Sao Paulo for $5,000 per kilo, and then is taken by the traffickers to Lagos, Nigeria. There, it is worth $17,000 per kilo. From Lagos, the cocaine is taken to Switzerland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Canada, where a kilogram of cocaine can reach the price of $60,000. Given the Nigerian cocaine trafficking route, all passengers on the weekly flight to Lagos are filmed in the airport. Suspects are followed day and night by police. The tactic has worked. Since the beginning of the year, Federal Police have arrested 14 drug traffickers red-handed in Guarulhos International Airport, Sao Paulo, and confiscated 100 kg of cocaine from them. The confiscations reveal that the Nigerians are experts in camouflaging the drug; for example, drugs can be hidden inside a spray can that, like this one, can conceal up to 300 grams of cocaine. Cocaine also was found in the inner soles of tennis shoes. Drug traffickers normally create double-bottom suitcases. Nigerians go further. The whole structure of this suitcase is pure cocaine that, mixed with a resin, has been shaped into a suitcase. The most difficult way to detect cocaine, but also the most dangerous for the drug trafficker, is cocaine capsules. Nigerians can swallow up to 60 capsules at once. They thus use their own body to hide the drugs.
