David A. Kessler, Commissioner of Food and Drugs, and James S. Todd, Executive Vice President of the AMA, will be the keynote speakers. The conference should be of interest to the following groups: Practicing health professionals, health professional organizations, health professions educators (undergraduate and graduate), health professionals of State health departments, regulatory and safety surveillance professionals, and hospital personnel (e.g, risk managers/quality assurance personnel and members of Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committees). This is a participatory conference. Recommendations from the breakout sessions will be presented on the second day of the conference and their implementation discussed at the final panel discussion.
