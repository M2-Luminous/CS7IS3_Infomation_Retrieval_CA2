What happened in the process has once again served to show that the ruling coalition government is "controlled by the bureaucracy," something for which the coalition government has been under fire ever since the inauguration of the administration of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa last year. For Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, this could be considered a political blunder which may possibly give the impression that he lacks leadership in an area that has to do with Japan's basic stance in foreign affairs. At a news conference following a lower house budget committee meeting on 8 June, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai told reporters: "(After the Foreign Ministry drew up the official statement), it was referred to ruling coalition parties so as to lay the groundwork for its approval. However, word about this spread and turned into a controversy." He thus hinted that top government officials, including Prime Minister Hata and Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, failed to review the statement sufficiently. Even amidst rising objection in the nation to the government's stance on the issue, the Foreign Ministry continued to doggedly maintain its stance, saying "there is no change in the government's legal view of the issue" (as stated by Foreign Ministry spokesman Terasuke Terada). In the past, the government has made it known that this was its stance not only at Diet sessions, but also whenever it had the chance to discuss nuclear arms issues during informal talks with allied nations and with members of international organizations. However, to indicate the government's stance to the ICJ via an official document would add considerable weight to the significance of this "stance." Moreover, as the issue of the DPRK's (North Korea's) suspected development of nuclear arms has become a serious international concern, it could have been predicted well in advance that making public such a government stance in the form of bureaucrats' explanation to the ruling coalition parties would create a controversy not among politicians, but also among the people. There are many ruling coalition party officials who shake their heads in amazement. When Prime Minister Hata first glanced through the statement, he reportedly felt that "it was hard to understand." However, the Foreign Ministry explained that "this stance has been repeatedly disclosed in the past," and the prime minister accepted the explanation without further question. This is what has complicated the matters. This situation of letting bureaucrats take care of government affairs became evident again at a meeting of the lower house Committee on Foreign Affairs on 8 June. Foreign Minister Kakizawa was unable to make a clear answer to a question by Tadatoshi Akiba, a member of the Social Democratic Party of Japan, who asked: "Does this mean that if North Korea uses nuclear weapons, you cannot say that this is a violation of international law?" Even though some cabinet ministers voiced objection to the government stance on the issue of the legality of the use of nuclear arms, a decision was made to delete the clause regarding this stance only after deliberations at the lower house Budget Committee meeting came to a halt over this matter. All this has led to doubts about Prime Minister Hata's and other ministers' leadership. Moreover, such action cannot help but give the impression that the Hata administration has merely tried to ride out the situation for the time being, since the government maintains that it will not change its legal view of the issue.
