[SEMANA] It has been said that your campaign will target a small number of basic issues. Which ones? [Pastrana] When I launch my campaign, I will tell the country what the main issues of my government program are. They are seven in number and special emphasis will be placed on social issues. On 10 February, Colombia will realize that it is a serious, solid program that will propel the country into the 21st century. My platform will seal my ineludible commitment to Colombia. [SEMANA] Why did you wait so long before launching your campaign? What benefits do you think can be derived from making it a lightning campaign, as many call it? [Pastrana] It is not a lightning campaign. Every political campaign has its time. In Europe, campaigns last 30 days. Please remember that I do not aspire to any candidacy in the preliminary campaign. I am a candidate for the May elections, not the March or October elections, as others claim. I am not a person who improvises, much less makes casual promises. I am a man of my word, a man who keeps his commitments. That is why I took several months to draft the government program that I shall submit to the Colombian people for their judicious examination, months that I spent listening to and learning from others. I toured the country and concluded that I share a common vision with the people concerning our country's most urgent problems and the course it must take. [SEMANA] Why do you think the Colombian people should back you in the presidential elections? [Pastrana] Because I am familiar with and know in what direction the country should be headed. I have experience and keep my commitments, as I have demonstrated in my public and private life, in the practice of journalism, and in my terms as mayor and in the nation's Senate. They should back me because I will seek to surround myself with the best people without distinction as to party, race, creed, or social status. Finally, I believe firmly in Colombia and will not fail Colombians in my pledge to implement my government platform. [SEMANA] Your adversaries criticize the great influence which they believe your father, former President Misael Pastrana, has on you. How are your relations with him and how dependent on him are you? Do you think you would be a candidate if you were not the son of a former president? [Pastrana] My relations with my father are excellent. I have said so before and I repeat it now. What is more, I admire, respect, and love him, as do the rest of my brothers and sisters. Nevertheless, we are different persons living in different times. We have disagreed on many occasions in public and in private. He has been a harsh critic of some acts of government that I have backed. He condemned the president's candidacy for the Office of Secretary General of the OAS. In contrast, I supported it, deeming it a positive thing for Colombia. He is very respectful of my opinions and my way of looking at politics, and I respect his equally. As for the second question, I am not one for responding to mere conjectures. Nevertheless, you can be sure that I definitely would have been a candidate. My responsibilities in the public sector have always been backed by the people's votes. [SEMANA] There are those in this country who think that Cesar Gaviria has already carried out enough reforms in the legal, political, and economic areas, and that it is up to his successor to administer those changes and stabilize the rules of play. Do you share that vision? [Pastrana] I share the vision which President Cesar Gaviria has of the country. The reforms initiated by his administration are a starting point. While Colombia has made a major shift, it will be up to the next president to consolidate processes, introduce adjustments, and carry them out in the face of many problems with innovative, realistic ideas. [SEMANA] The issue of the guerrillas remains on the agenda. Do you think that after an attack such as the one on the minister of finance and a slaughter of poor people like that carried out by the guerrillas in Uraba, it is possible to reopen the doors to dialogue and a negotiated settlement? [Pastrana] Colombia has had important lessons in how to handle the guerrilla problem. By my very nature, I support reconciliation. I am not one of those who close a door and throw away the key. And yet, I shall not allow peace to become a "leg up" for continuing the war. We have become accustomed to governments that swing back and forth between war and peace. If there is any one thing that we Colombians must bear in mind, it is that it is not the government that is waging the war. The National Government has an obligation to defend the life, honor, and property of all Colombians, independently of what friendly or barbarous acts the guerrillas and criminals commit. It has no choice. That is why there can be no argument about strengthening the military forces and intelligence units. [SEMANA] Do you think that the solution to the stalemate in these negotiations could be the beginning of regional dialogues, as the guerrillas are asking? [Pastrana] The president is the one responsible for maintaining law and order. He has a constitutional mandate that he must heed, enforce, and not delegate. Otherwise, we would end up dividing the country unnecessarily. I do not even want to imagine that one of the FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] fronts could be slaughtering children in Cauca while another is attending a political cocktail party in the capital and all under the same central command! And yet, regional and local authorities do play a key role in ensuring the pacification of the country. They know the factors of violence in their region better than anyone else. It is therefore their duty to support the government in enforcing law and order, to advise and heed it, without this turning into a license for entering into a dialogue with the guerrillas behind the president's back. [SEMANA] Will you keep the office of minister of defense in the hands of a civilian or, on the contrary, do you intend to name one of the highest-ranking officials of the Armed Forces, as has been done in the past? [Pastrana] I like the institution of the civilian minister of defense very much and it has functioned well, even better in the hands of persons like the husband of the manager of my campaign. [SEMANA] What do you think of the contacts which the Office of Prosecutor General has maintained with the attorneys of the Cali Cartel? Do you think it would be meaningful, as has been proposed during those contacts, to reach an agreement with that group implying that their leaders could serve their prison sentences in their own homes? [Pastrana] I do not favor allowing prison sentences to be served at home. That is an absurd idea that would never have entered my head. The policy of bringing criminals to justice cannot become a policy of bringing justice to the criminals. The government's efforts to reduce violence cannot lend themselves to improvisations or an under-the-table manipulation of our system of justice. [SEMANA] What is your opinion of the antikidnapping norms, particularly the debate generated by a decision of the Constitutional Court and by Dr. Carlos Upegui to the effect that relatives of kidnap victims should not be prevented from bargaining over their ransom? [Pastrana] I am convinced that there is no argument, not even one that could grow out of possible political agreements with guerrilla groups, that would justify granting pardons or amnesty for that atrocious crime. There is no justification for kidnapping and those who engage in it must know this unequivocally. We cannot make progress toward eliminating it if we do not establish certain concrete guidelines once and for all. We cannot yield to blackmail. I was a sponsor of the antikidnapping law in the Senate and unreservedly backed the measure of the Free Country Foundation. Now that we know the Court's ruling, which substantially limited the range of the law, we must think of effective alternatives in order to fight the kidnapping industry without wavering. I am happy that Carlos Upegui is free and I am sure that he repudiates this crime of lese humanite as I do. [SEMANA] You are considered a leader of the new right. Along that line of ideas, what do you think should be the future of the policy of economic liberalization [apertura] and privatizations? [Pastrana] That is an outdated label in a world where action speaks louder than words. Rhetoric has to take a back seat. We live in new times and accomplishments take priority. I am not of the new right, nor am I a neoliberal, as some insist on calling me. I believe in sustained economic growth capable of guaranteeing a better distribution of income and a substantial improvement in the standard of living of the Colombian people. Along that line of ideas, the future of the policy of economic liberalization will depend upon providing our productive sector with better tools so that it may be more efficient and competitive and thus generate productive jobs. A joint effort is required in which both the government and the private sector assume their responsibilities. The latter cannot do it alone. It has already done a great deal and now it is up to the government to do likewise. Privatizations are not a panacea. They are not inherently good or bad. I think they are a good idea if they guarantee efficiency in the case of public services and an interesting alternative for generating resources that will enable the government to properly meet its social obligations, obligations that it can neither postpone nor delegate, such as education, security, and justice. [SEMANA] Speaking of privatizations, do you think they should continue to be carried out by auctions? [Pastrana] Whatever procedure is followed must be transparent. However, I do not agree that the most important thing is to obtain the highest price. In some cases, it may be important for the enterprise being privatized to have a leader who can impose efficiency. In other cases, there may be a greater possibility for many Colombians to participate and thus democratize property. That is a debate which has not yet taken place in Colombia and which the recent Court ruling puts on the carpet. [SEMANA] Another latent proposal is the possibility that Colombia may join the ranks of the Free Trade Agreement that now involves Mexico, the United States, and Canada. Will you back that initiative? [Pastrana] Yes, I would. The Free Trade Agreement offers us great possibilities and opportunities and it would therefore be desirable to be part of it at the earliest possible date. Nevertheless, I do not think we are at the top of the list of candidates, which means that what is most important is to make the most of the time available and adequately prepare to enter that market with a solid, competitive industry. [SEMANA] One of the most important decisions that you will have to make in the weeks ahead is the name of your running mate: the vice presidential candidate. What qualifications will he have? Will he be a liberal or a conservative? Will he be young like you or an older person? [Pastrana] It changes daily. I will make that decision later on. [SEMANA] If you win the elections, you will certainly govern with a Congress having a Liberal majority. How do you expect to handle that situation, based on your conservative background? [Pastrana] I shall try to form a consensus on the major national issues. We shall first determine which are the priority issues in my government program that require the approval of Congress. They will be solid projects that I am sure will enjoy legislative support. While partisan forces play a preponderant role in Congress, I am confident that there will be more congressmen who prefer the country's welfare over their efforts to obstruct the work of the government. [SEMANA] You recently had a number of contacts with Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera. Do you think your good relations with that leader, whom many identify as anti-Colombian, can help resolve the dispute over the Gulf? [Pastrana] Without question, the fact of having good personal relations with President Caldera can help improve the climate of understanding between our countries and even smooth the way to a resolution of the problem of the dispute, which does not mean that our friendship is the decisive factor. [SEMANA] Colombia has never had a president who has not served as minister. Do you not agree that missing that step hurts you? [Pastrana] It is generally agreed that the Office of Mayor of Bogota is the second most important post in the country. In addition to administrative management, the experience I gained in handling times of crisis brought on by the onslaught of the drug terrorists taught me important lessons. Having served as mayor of Bogota, with the commitment implied by election by the people, far exceeds the responsibility of any ministry. [Box, p 31] Andres' "Staff" 1--Luis Alberto Moreno: General campaign coordinator. With a degree in Business Administration from Atlantic University [as published] (United States), this former minister of development is a talented, discreet man and the "guru" of the Pastrana camp ever since serving as manager of "TV-Today News." Some view him as the political genius who "thought up" Andres. 2--Francisco Lloreda: Pastrana's private secretary when the latter was mayor of Bogota. In charge of coordinating operations. A graduate of the Javerian School of Law who specialized in Public Administration at the University of Colombia and who has a background in journalism at Cali's EL PAIS, the daily newspaper published by his father, Rodrigo Lloreda. Simple, serious, and circumspect, if Pastrana should become president, "Kiko," as he is called, would be the government's "Miguel Silva." 3--Claudia de Francisco: She has been and remains a "workaholic." Her resume contains such posts as vice president for marketing of the Bank of Colombia, the Office of Secretary of Finance of the District, and the post of manager of the Bogota Telephone Enterprise. Now, as administrative coordinator of the campaign and wife of Minister of Defense Rafael Pardo, she has become a bridge between "Pastranism" and "Gavirianism." Or the reverse.... 4--Maristella Sanin: Close to Pastrana on the Senate bench of the New Democratic Force. In this campaign, she focuses her efforts on political support. A graduate of the Javerian School of Law, she is backed by her experience, not only in Congress, but also at the head of the Labor Ministry. 5--Diego Pardo: Although no longer the young blade that he was while serving as mayor of Bogota, this cachaco retains his fire, coordinating the Youth movement with Andres. In addition to serving as burgomaster of the country's capital--briefly--this graduate of the Javerian School of Law with a Master's from SMU in Dallas (Texas) served as director of CAR [Bogota Plain and Ubate and Chiquinquira Valleys Autonomous Regional Corporation] and superintendent of Exchange Control. 6--Carlos Duque: Adviser for communications, image, and publicity, he is also the man who practically revolutionized the image of political publicity in Colombia. The author of the first--and famous--poster for Luis Carlos Galan. 7--Juan Hernandez: Has been with Pastrana since the University of the Rosary, where they were classmates at the College of Jurisprudence. Served as councilman of Bogota, secretary of government during the Pastrana mayoralty, and consul in Houston (Texas). Heads the Multipliers Program. 8--Efrain Marin: Press director. Was on the staff of newsmen at "TV-Today News." 9--Gloria Isabel Ramirez: Publicity coordinator. 10--Marta de Arevalo: Volunteer coordinator. 11--Gustavo Pombo: Appointed to coordinate the campaign launching ceremony and the accompanying falderal. 12--Hernan Beltz: Financial coordinator. Civil engineer, but with an important career in the public sector (served as director of the National Planning Department and minister of public works), he was a member of the conservative board of directors of the Tequendama line. A personal friend of Alvaro Gomez.
