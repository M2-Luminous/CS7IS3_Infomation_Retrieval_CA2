[Krzaklewski] Recession means a fall in the GNP. But the GNP has been rising in recent years. In 1992 it rose by 1.9 percent, and in 1993 it rose by 4 percent. Industrial output has risen even more. In a situation like this, every trade union has the right and duty to demand wage rises in the production sphere. Wages should rise faster than prices. We included this postulate in the "accords to compensate the increase in the cost of living," in other words the Enterprise Pact. The provisions are clear. An increase in real wages in the production sphere cannot be less than half the increase in the GNP. The pact has been signed into law, but not only is the present government failing to implement this law, it is ignoring it altogether. In view of this, every self-respecting trade union must dictate harsh terms to the government, including the possibility of a general strike. Therefore we demand an increase in real wages, at least to offset the increased living costs, because the country is experiencing an economic growth. A preliminary analysis of the 1994 draft budget shows that there is a danger that the real incomes of families will fall even further. We cannot agree to that, all the more so because 1993 was another year of economic growth. And that is the main reason for our demonstration on 9 February. [Pawlas] Governments are not accustomed to adhere to pacts. That is a tradition dating to communist times. However, they do tend to lay down so-called social guarantees, a process that can last for months. So what is the point of establishing pacts when the budget is empty? [Krzaklewski] I fear that unless the philosophy behind fiscal policy changes soon, there will be continued talk of empty budgets over the next few years, despite the increase in output. Also, an increasingly greater proportion of the GNP is going to be swallowed by the so-called gray economic zone and by investors. The rich will get richer, and the poor poorer. [passage omitted] [Pawlas] The defense industry has staged a strike, and the miners are demanding higher wages. Can the 9 February demonstration be regarded as a forerunner to a general strike? [Krzaklewski] Yes, if the government fails to adjust the socioeconomic program laid down in the 1994 draft budget, and if it fails to implement the whole of the 1992-93 social pact, known as the Enterprise Pact, within a reasonable time, such as by the end of March 1994. I hope we do not reach a situation in which we have to declare a strike. Our postulates concerning the budget and Enterprise Pact are possible for the government and parliament to fulfill, and their fulfillment will stabilize the social situation. We also insist that the government fulfill not more than 10 percent of the preelection promises of the coalition parties.
