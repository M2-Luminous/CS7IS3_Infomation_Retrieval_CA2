The five measures are, first, prices of grain and vegetable oil must be brought down as quickly as possible with state-owned stores throughout the province being obliged to sell rice at a fixed price before December 31. Second, state-owned stores must become the main outlets guaranteeing the supply of grain and take the lead in controlling prices. Third, the transportation of grain sold by the state must be speeded up. Fourth, grain purchasing must be well handled to increase grain reserves. Fifth, there must be strengthened supervision and management of the marketing of grain and vegetable oil. Before December 31, all state-owned stores must see that there is sufficient supply of grain in order to bring down prices and anyone found raising prices to speculate will be seriously dealt with.
