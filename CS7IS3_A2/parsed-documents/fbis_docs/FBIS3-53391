Baghdad AL-THAWRAH, on page 8, carries a 250-word unsigned article headlined "In Light of the Discontinuation of the Youth Radio and Television; the Need To Resume Transmission" emphasizing "that the Youth Television Channel and the Voice of Youth Radio have been well received by the various sectors of the people in view of their effective and developed performance and their serious presentation." The paper adds: "For these reasons, we believe it is necessary to review the question of the discontinuation of the Voice of Youth Radio and the Youth Television because this discontinuation is an irreplaceable loss under these circumstances where our militant country experiences the most ferocious conspiracies in which the enemy forces use all means, including war propaganda, which we must face with new methods." The article further says: "We hope that these two stations will resume transmission so that they may perform the role required of them." Baghdad AL-JUMHURIYAH, also on page 8, carries a 300-word article by Ahmad Hatif on the same topic. The article says "Suddenly, the Youth Radio and Television transmitters stopped working, and thousands of the fans of this youthful voice waited for a clear reply to a difficult question, and we received many phone calls asking about the secret and seeking a reply that we do not have about the interruption of a long-awaited dream." The article goes on to say "We believe that in the interest of Iraqi media, the media of the Mother of Battles, this honest voice should resume transmission as soon as possible. If some say that technical and operational mistakes accompanied this mistake, this does not mean that this experiment should be ignored. Mistakes should be corrected, initiatives encouragerd, new plans should be formulated, and life reinfused in this unique experiment." Baghdad Republic of Iraq Radio Network in Arabic at 1514 GMT on 10 January carried an announcement filed as referent item that: "The youth radio and television have resumed their transmission as of 1800 [1500 GMT] this evening." The radio does not give any reason for the interruption.
