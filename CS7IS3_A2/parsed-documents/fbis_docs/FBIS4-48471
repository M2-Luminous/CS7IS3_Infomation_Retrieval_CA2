The meeting is believed to have centered on removing obstacles in the way of the peace process. Inside sources said one of the highlights of the meeting was the slow pace of the deployment of the expanded ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] throughout Liberia which is a prerequisite to the disarmament exercise of all fighting groups in the country. This has been the hurdle in carrying out the military aspect of the Cotonou accord.
