The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is reviewing the application for a new license for the continued operation of the Gulf Island_Deer Rips Project on the Androscoggin River, Maine. As part of the licensing proceedings for the Gulf Island_Deer Rips Project, the Commission issued a ``Notice of Intention to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the Lower Androscoggin River, Conduct Project Site Visits, and Hold Public Scoping Meetings'' on April 11, 1994. The Staff was informed by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection that the agency scoping meeting scheduled for May 13, 1994, conflicted with a scheduled furlough day for state employees in Maine. Due to the above conflict, the morning scoping meeting, originally scheduled for May 13, 1994, will be held on May 12, 1994, from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m., at the Quality Inn, 1777 Washington Street, Auburn, Maine. The site visit for the Gulf Island_Deer Rips Project will begin at 10:30 a.m. May 12, 1994, or immediately following the agency scoping meeting, at the Gulf Island Powerhouse.
