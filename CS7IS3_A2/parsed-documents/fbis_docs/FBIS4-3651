Achieving this goal will require the nation to control its population growth, save resources, protect the environment and ensure social stability, reported Management World magazine. China has a long way to go to complete these tasks and is already confronting serious challenges in these four areas of concern. China entered a period of rapid population growth in the 1950's when industrialization took off following Liberation in 1949. The baby boom slowed down after family planning began in 1978 but the problem still looms large because of the huge population already created. Birth control limits should be based on economic development, the reserve of resources and environmental conditions, said the State Council-supported magazine. Demographers have set specific targets for national birth rate. China should keep its population below 1.3 billion by the turn of the century, below 1.46 billion by 2020 and realize zero growth -- where the number of births and deaths are roughly equal -- by the year 2030. Maximum population in the next century should not exceed 1.6 billion, the article suggests. Experts predict the elderly and labour population will peak between 2020 and 2040. Total population will be at least 1.5 billion by 2040, two thirds of whom will be in the 15-64 age group. About 300 million people will be at least 60 years old. To provide work for all these people China should try all possible means to create more opportunities by developing labour- intensive businesses. Old Age The article suggests the 1990's will be a golden time to tap workforce potential. After this decade a large proportion of the population will enter old age. Much of the populace are from the rural areas. To provide jobs for them, it is important to transfer surplus labour to related or even nonagricultural sectors. Farmers can be organized to harness desertification, assigned to afforestry and irrigation projects or the construction of other infrastructure facilities. Alternative employment can be found in township enterprises and service industries. The vast pool of scientific personnel should also develop hi-tech enterprises in big cities, coastal areas, and regions along the Yangtze River. Secondly, China should save and make a more efficient use of its limited resources. Thriftiness must be upheld in both consumption and production. China cannot imitate the developed countries' model of resource allocation; instead, it should choose a cost efficient plan. To promote efficient agriculture, land and water should be saved. Fields can be used for multiple cropping and advanced irrigation projects can bring marginal arid lands into production. In industry, new technology should be introduced to save energy and raw materials. Redundant projects should be eliminated and waste should be recycled, a practice that would also help the environment. Lifestyle A luxurious lifestyle in daily life should be discouraged. Staple food should be plant-oriented; more chemical fabrics should be manufactured to replace cotton products to relieve the pressure on the land, allowing more food to be grown; more apartment buildings, public buses, and subways should be developed. Thirdly, environment protection should run parallel to economic construction. Protection should be written into the long-term social and economic development programme. Environment-friendly economic and technological policies should be encouraged. Clean industrial production and ecological agriculture should be promoted. Environmental protection agencies at all levels should be reinforced; laws and regulations should also be drafted and strictly enforced. A national network monitoring environmental conditions should be established and international cooperation should be sought and enhanced. Fourth, national economic development should be stable, sustained and concerted. The past 40 years demonstrated that too high a growth rate can lead to economic setbacks and severe losses. The government should take economic measures to regulate development speed. And the development of different sectors of the national economy should be coordinated. Growth Rate After analyzing economic growth in the past 40 years, experts suggest that the Gross National Product should grow at 6 to 7 percent, the agricultural output value should increase 3-4 percent, and grain output 2-3 percent. Industrial output value should grow 10-12 percent. Specifically, light industry needs to grow 10-12 percent and heavy industry 11-13 percent. Per capita income should climb at 5-6 percent. If such growth can be maintained, the economy can develop smoothly. As China witnesses the economic boom, it will have trouble adjusting the relationship between population and resources, supply and demand, and between economic development and social progress. During this period, the government should keep close watch on the national economy and be cautious in introducing economic and social reform packages. The government should curb inflation, minimize the widening income gap, and reduce the friction between conflicting interests and political and cultural groups. Meanwhile, the government should also establish a management system compatible with the demands of the market economy. This management system should extend its responsibility to production, distribution, circulation, and consumption.
