First report by Igor Mosin: "Shivering by Nuclear Stove." Second report by Vladimir Gubarev: "Fission as Social Disease"] [Text] Desnogorsk, Smolensk Oblast -- The first step has been taken toward shutting down Russia's nuclear complex. The Smolensk AES [nuclear power station] has reduced electricty production by 30 percent. The Kursk, Leningrad, and Novovoronezh AES's will be forced to follow its example in the coming days. I walk down the AES' long deserted passageways together with its director. Now only duty personnel and security are working here. "Where does the paradox of the current situation lie?" A. Zemskov, chief of the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy public relations board, asks. "In the fact that AES's provide consumers with electricity which is half as expensive as that produced by thermal power stations. But the `YeES Rossii' Russian joint-stock stock company -- the organization involved in the distribution of electric power and collecting money for this -- `treats' its consumers as if all power is produced at thermal stations. And continually raise their prices. Typical monopolist mentality. If we had the opportunity to supply power directly to consumers, it would cost them exactly half as much." There is a normal working atmosphere at the power station's control desk. The director requests personnel to prepare to reduce capacity. They show no concern. Five, 10, 20 minutes pass. The operator pulls some levers and presses some buttons. Figures flash up on a monitor. Capacity has begun to be reduced. Somewhere behind the nuclear reactors' very thick walls the nuclear processes have begun to slow down. You see it is all very simple and commonplace. How might events develop in the future? Today AES's are shutting down because they do not have the money to buy fresh nuclear fuel. The "YeES Rossii" Russian joint-stock company is 50 billion rubles [R] in debt to the Smolensk AES alone. In all this respected monopoly is more than 350 billion in debt to the nuclear complex. To be fair I must say that consumers are considerably in debt to the "YeES Rossii" Russian joint-stock company as well. This is another of the age's economic paradoxes. Gasoline is selling like hot cakes but the oil refineries are shutting down. Electricity is in a similar situation. If the AES's do not get the money owed them in the near future, they will reduce their capacities to 40, then 50 [figure as published], then 20 percent. Then a full shutdown will occur. [end of Mosin report] The crisis in Russia's nuclear power industry is increasing -- you can count the days the fuel will last at the AES's. Enterprise directors have been meeting for several days now at the "TVEL" concern, which produces nuclear fuel, in order to find a way out of the crisis. What has the nuclear power industry thought up? Uranium pellets are produced at a combine in Ust-Kamenogorsk, Kazakhstan. From there the pellets have to get to "Mashinostroitelnyy Zavod" in Elektrostal, where rods are produced, and only then do the rod assemblies go to the Leningrad AES. This well-known AES worked "for nothing" last year -- it produced electricity but received no payment. Consequently, it is unable to pay for the fuel from Elektrostal, which in turn is not paying for the uranium tablets to be produced. What is more, Ust-Kamenogorsk is now in a foreign country, so that there are in addition all sorts of interstate complications here.... The "new economic plan" devised at the "TVEL" concern is as follows. The Ust-Kamenogorsk combine is in debt to Kazakhstan's power system for electricity, the latter is in turn in debt to YeES Rossii, and it has already built up a debt of many tens of billions of rubles to Leningrad AES. Mutual clearing settlements are made along this chain. Plants in Izhora are also not settling their electricity bills. Now Izhora is going to give away its excavators which Kazakhstan needs and which it cannot pay for, and in their place uranium pellets will go to Elektrostal. The only thing is that you cannot pay the enterprises' workers either in uranium pellets or excavators. Superficially, the "new system" of payment looks attractive: The plants work and the AES's are not shut down. But it was barter which was preeminent in the feudal period, and which finally made that state system collapse. The Russian nuclear power industry produces the cheapest electricity. According to the conclusions of international experts, it worked in as reliable and efficient manner last year as the Japanese, and according to the majority of indicators surpassed the French and in particular the Americans. I must repeat that these figures come from international organizations! The only thing is that we and the government are making incredible difficulties for it (seemingly deliberately!). Unfortunately, we simply have not heeded the lessons of Chernobyl and are unable to learn from our own misfortunes.
