The ministry spokesman, Ding Junfa, said dwindling output forces the State to continue planning and managing all purchases, marketing and storage of cotton. The statement refuted calls from some local sectors to open up the market. Ding said the State will stick to a unified production and price policy this year and rural supply and marketing co-operatives will be the only organs allowed to purchase and market cotton. In the past two years, cotton output has fallen dramatically because of poor weather, pests and plant diseases. And government purchases from last fall's crop amounted to only two thirds of the total from the harvest in 1992, a recent report in the Farmers' Daily said. The ministry is taking a series of measures to improve cotton purchases and marketing this year. Major textile enterprises with good production and profit records will be provided with an adequate supply, while those involved in the speculation and profiteering of cotton will face penalties, Ding said. And to make up for the cotton shortage, some textile plants are increasing the use of synthetic fibres and imported raw materials, he added.
