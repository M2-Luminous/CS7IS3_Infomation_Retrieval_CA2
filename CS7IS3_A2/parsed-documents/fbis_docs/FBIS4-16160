FBIS4-16160 "drsov072_a_94004" FBIS-SOV-94-072 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Foreign Ministry Statement on Developments in Bosnia Foreign Ministry Statement on Developments in Bosnia LD1304124194 Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service in Russian 1129 GMT 13 Apr 94 LD1304124194 Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service Russian BFN [Text] Moscow, 13 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- A representative from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs today released the following statement: Moscow is following the development of events in the former Yugoslavia and around it with concern and responsibility. The NATO air strikes of 10 and 11 April have substantially aggravated the military and political situation. The Russian side repeatedly warned of this. The international community must now act urgently to save the situation. Russia's resolve to continue its initiatives in this direction has been confirmed by its president and foreign minister, the Russian president's special representative is working actively in the region. We are worried that the statements made in support of the act of force in Gorazde, by many Western leaders, could lead to reliance on force in Bosnian and in world affairs in general. Reports have already appeared about discussions in NATO headquarters of new ultimatums to the Serbs, by-passing the United Nations. We do not accept this policy and would put in its place a policy of genuine partnership and cooperation -- not just in words but in action, for the sake of stability and security. So we insist on an unconditional observation of the procedures approved by the UN Security Council for bringing aircraft into action in Bosnia, which stipulate consultations with the UN Secretary General and members of the Security Council. We still expect exhaustive reports from the UN Secretariat General about what happened in the Gorazde region. The appropriate instructions have been given to our representative at the United Nations. According to information confirmed by the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] leadership, the events in Gorazde began with provocative activities on the part of Muslim armed formations, which met with an incommensurate response from the Bosnian Serbs. The Muslim provocations are continuing even now. The UNPROFOR headquarters in Sarajevo confirms that on 11 April the Muslims attacked the Serb-held village of Lapsiza north of Pale, and on 12 April they mortared Serb positions around Gorazde. Bellicose pronouncements by the Bosnian Serbs about their intention to shoot down all aircraft overflying their positions are also a cause for concern. We again appeal to all parties to refrain from any provocative activities, as the UN Security Council has demanded at Russia's initiative. At the same time all countries committed to a settlement of the crisis and the world community as a whole must get the Bosnian parties to behave in precisely this way and to return to the negotiating table in order to achieve a durable and comprehensive cease-fire. Opportunities for this do still exist. For its part Russia is doing its utmost to promote the earliest possible settlement.
