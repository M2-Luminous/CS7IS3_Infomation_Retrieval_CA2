In a letter to the Council of Agriculture, CITES recommended that all rhino horn and tiger bone held by individuals be placed under government control at an appointed venue. The letter came about three weeks after CITES had sent officials to Taiwan on a fact-finding mission. A CITES committee voted 3-3 earlier this year to postpone trade sanctions proposed by Britain's Environmental Investigation Agency, which claimed Taiwan has only perfunctorily cracked down on the illegal trade of rhino horn and tiger bone. However, Tang Hsiao-yu, a COA section chief in charge of conservation affairs, indicated Tuesday [28 December] that implementing the latest CITES proposal would be difficult because the government cannot force the public to surrender private property. CITES suggested in its letter that the ROC add a provision to its existing wildlife conservation law mandating individuals to register any rhino horn or tiger bone they own, and that a special government agency be organized to crack down on trading of endangered species on the island. It also proposed that the government strengthen coordination with other countries, including Mainland China, to combat smuggling of endangered species.
