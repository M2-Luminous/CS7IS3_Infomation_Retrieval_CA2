FR940617-0-00159 FR940617-0-00026 Subpart B_Emission Standards and Certification Provisions §89.101&hyph;96 Applicability. The requirements of subpart B are applicable to all new nonroad compression-ignition engines subject to the provisions of subpart A of part 89, pursuant to the schedule delineated in §89.102&hyph;96. §89.102&hyph;96 Effective dates, optional inclusion. (a) This subpart applies to all engines described in § 89.101&hyph;96 with the following gross power output and manufactured after the following dates: (1) Greater than or equal to 37 kW but less than 75 kW and manufactured on or after January 1, 1998; (2) Greater than or equal to 75 kW but less than 130 kW and manufactured on or after January 1, 1997; (3) Greater than or equal to 130 kW but less than or equal to 560 kW and manufactured on or after January 1, 1996; (4) Greater than 560 kW and manufactured on or after January 1, 2000. (b) A manufacturer can optionally certify engines manufactured up to one calendar year prior to the effective date of mandatory certification to earn emission credits under the averaging, banking, and trading program. Such optionally certified engines are subject to all provisions relating to mandatory certification and enforcement described in this part. §89.103&hyph;96 Definitions. The definitions in subpart A of part 89 apply to this subpart. All terms not defined herein or in subpart A have the meaning given them in the Act. §89.104&hyph;96 Useful life, recall, and warranty periods. (a) The useful life is a period of 8,000 hours of operation or ten years of use, whichever first occurs. (b) Engines are subject to recall testing for a period of 6,000 hours of operation or seven years of use, whichever first occurs. However, in a recall, engines in the subject class or category must be recalled regardless of actual years or hours of operation. (c) Warranties imposed by the Clean Air Act are for 3,000 hours of operation or five years of use, whichever first occurs. (d) Manufacturers may apply to the Administrator for approval for a shorter useful life period for engines that are subject to severe service in seasonal equipment, or are designed specifically for lower useful life hours to match equipment life. Such an application must be made prior to certification. §89.105&hyph;96 Certificate of conformity. Every manufacturer of a new nonroad compression-ignition engine must obtain a certificate of conformity covering the engine family, as described in §89.116&hyph;96. The certificate of conformity must be obtained from the Administrator prior to selling, offering for sale, introducing into commerce, or importing into the United States the new nonroad compression-ignition engine for each model year. §89.106&hyph;96 Prohibited controls. (a) An engine may not be equipped with an emission control system for the purpose of complying with emission standards if such system will cause or contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety in its operation or function. (b) An engine with an emission control system may not emit any noxious or toxic substance which would not be emitted in the operation of such engine in the absence of such system except as specifically permitted by regulation. §89.107&hyph;96 Defeat devices. (a) An engine may not be equipped with a defeat device. (b) For purposes of this section, ``defeat device'' means any device, system, or element of design which senses operation outside normal emission test conditions and reduces emission control effectiveness. (1) Defeat device includes any auxiliary emission control device (AECD) that reduces the effectiveness of the emission control system under conditions which may reasonably be expected to be encountered in normal operation and use unless such conditions are included in the test procedure.
