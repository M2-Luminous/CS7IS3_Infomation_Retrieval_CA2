Ramos with domestic and foreign correspondents at Malacanang Palace in Manila -- live] [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] On the Korean summit, you're familiar with the developments? The two heads of state concerned, the president of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea -- President Kim Il-song and President Kim Yong-sam, respectively -- have agreed to meet in Pyongyang late July after some preliminary conferences by subordinate officials. And I would like to see this as opening up a new era of regional stability in the Asia-Pacific region. I therefore convey our admiration for the two Korean leaders for showing statesmanship in pursuing the path of peace rather than the path of belligerent confrontation. You will recall that this has been our consistent policy at the height of the nuclear confrontation in the Korean peninsula, and even before. Questions so far? I also would like to inform everyone that I am satisfied with the conclusion of the first round of negotiations between the Philippines and Indonesia on the delimiting, or the identification, of our maritime boundary. And I would like to point out that this opens up some opportunities for us to have, perhaps, a fishing agreement and thereby eliminate previous difficulties and confrontations which have taken place in the absence of such agreements.
