Karzan, who demanded that the security forces be ordered to give prior warning of a decision to evacuate Jews, withdrew his appeal after being convinced that the government does not intend to make such a move in the near future. Yiftah El'azar reports: The scenario was probably taken from the settlement leaders' threats in the media: Thousands of settlers flowing into Hebron preventing the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] from evacuating the Jewish settlers. Uri Karzan, a resident of Tall al-Rumaythah, appealed to the High Court to give prior warning of any evacuation. The state's response indicates that the government is worried that the above scenario could turn into reality. An early warning, the State Attorney's Office said, might foil the implementation of the government's decision. Although the government did not accept Karzan's demand for an early warning, Attorney Elyaqim Ha'etzni withdrew the appeal. [passage omitted] Karzel became convinced that the government does not plan to transfer the Hebron settlers at this stage. The state attorney said so in the response to the appeal. The government added in more legal terms: There is no reason why Karzal cannot appeal to the High Court after a decision on evacuation is made and he should not try to put the cart before the horse. The High Court, however, gave Karzel the right to appeal later on.
