FR940705-2-00200 FR940705-2-00091 Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;4&hyph;c. Internal facility appurtenances, such as light fixtures, air ducts, and utility pipes, are arranged to minimize the horizontal surface area on which dust can settle. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;4&hyph;d. Bench tops have seamless surfaces which are impervious to water and resistant to acids, alkalis, organic solvents, and moderate heat. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;4&hyph;e. Laboratory furniture is simple and of sturdy construction; and spaces between benches, cabinets, and equipment are accessible for cleaning. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;4&hyph;f. A foot, elbow, or automatically operated hand washing sink is provided near the door of each laboratory room in the facility. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;4&hyph;g. If there is a central vacuum system, it does not serve areas outside the facility. In-line high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filters are placed as near as practicable to each use point or service cock. Filters are installed to permit in-place decontamination and replacement. Other liquid and gas services to the facility are protected by devices that prevent back-flow. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;4&hyph;h. If water fountains are provided, they are foot operated and are located in the facility corridors outside the laboratory. The water service to the fountain is not connected to the back-flow protected distribution system supplying water to the laboratory areas. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;4&hyph;i. Access doors to the laboratory are self-closing and locking. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;4&hyph;j. Any windows are breakage resistant. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;4&hyph;k. A double-doored autoclave is provided for decontaminating materials passing out of the facility. The autoclave door which opens to the area external to the facility is sealed to the outer wall and automatically controlled so that the outside door can only be opened after the autoclave ``sterilization'' cycle has been completed. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;4&hyph;l. A pass-through dunk tank, fumigation chamber, or an equivalent decontamination method is provided so that materials and equipment that cannot be decontaminated in the autoclave can be safely removed from the facility. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;4&hyph;m. Liquid effluent from laboratory sinks, biological safety cabinets, floors, and autoclave chambers are decontaminated by heat treatment before being released from the maximum containment facility. Liquid wastes from shower rooms and toilets may be decontaminated with chemical disinfectants or by heat in the liquid waste decontamination system. The procedure used for heat decontamination of liquid wastes is evaluated mechanically and biologically by using a recording thermometer and an indicator microorganism with a defined heat susceptibility pattern. If liquid wastes from the shower room are decontaminated with chemical disinfectants, the chemical used is of demonstrated efficacy against the target or indicator microorganisms. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;4&hyph;n. An individual supply and exhaust air ventilation system is provided. The system maintains pressure differentials and directional airflow as required to assure flows inward from areas outside of the facility toward areas of highest potential risk within the facility. Manometers are used to sense pressure differentials between adjacent areas maintained at different pressure levels. If a system malfunctions, the manometers sound an alarm. The supply and exhaust airflow is interlocked to assure inward (or zero) airflow at all times. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;4&hyph;o. The exhaust air from the facility is filtered through high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filters and discharged to the outside so that it is dispersed away from occupied buildings and air intakes. Within the facility, the filters are located as near the laboratories as practicable in order to reduce the length of potentially contaminated air ducts. The filter chambers are designed to allow in situ decontamination before filters are removed and to facilitate certification testing after they are replaced. Coarse filters and HEPA filters are provided to treat air supplied to the facility in order to increase the lifetime of the exhaust HEPA filters and to protect the supply air system should air pressures become unbalanced in the laboratory. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;4&hyph;p. The treated exhaust air from Class I and II biological safety cabinets may be discharged into the laboratory room environment or the outside through the facility air exhaust system. If exhaust air from Class I or II biological safety cabinets is discharged into the laboratory the cabinets are tested and certified at six-month intervals. The exhaust air from Class III biological safety cabinets is discharged, without recirculation through two sets of high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filters in series, via the facility exhaust air system. If the treated exhaust air from any of these cabinets is discharged to the outside through the facility exhaust air system, it is connected to this system in a manner (e.g., thimble unit connection (see Appendix G&hyph;III&hyph;L)) that avoids any interference with the air balance of the cabinets or the facility exhaust air system. Appendix G&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;4&hyph;q. A specially designed suit area may be provided in the facility. Personnel who enter this area shall wear a one-piece positive pressure suit that is ventilated by a life-support system. The life-support system includes alarms and emergency backup breathing air tanks. Entry to this area is through an airlock fitted with airtight doors. A chemical shower is provided to decontaminate the surface of the suit before the worker exits the area. The exhaust air from the suit area is filtered by two sets of high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filters installed in series. A duplicate filtration unit, exhaust fan, and an automatically starting emergency power source are provided. The air pressure within the suit area is greater than that of any adjacent area. Emergency lighting and communication systems are provided. All penetrations into the internal shell of the suit are sealed. A double-doored autoclave is provided for decontaminating waste materials to be removed from the suit areas.
