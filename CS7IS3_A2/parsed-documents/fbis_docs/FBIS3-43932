[Seyoum] Our relations with the Saudi Kingdom are old, advanced, and based on goodneighborliness and mutual respect. We seek to strengthen and develop them further through exchange of visits and contacts. On this visit we have focused on political, trade, and economic ties and on the various Saudi sectors benefiting from the trade and investment atmosphere in Ethiopia, which now has a free economy in the full sense of the word. [Khalifah] Has your country achieved the necessary stability that would encourage investment? What were the circumstances relating to the question of the opposition conference and the arrests which followed? [Seyoum] Ethiopia is a democratic country in the full sense of the word. We have about 100 political parties and organizations. They all exercise their rights freely in accordance with the national charter which recognizes the full rights of the Ethiopian people and nationalities. There are dozens of newspapers, magazines, and periodicals which are free to publish what they like. That democratic thrust does not worry anyone. Quite the contrary, there have been positive developments throughout the country, especially in the economic and security fields. What happened recently, however, was that some groups called for armed action against the state and the public on the pretext of making political gains which can be achieved through open democratic activity for all. Some opposition parties have held a conference attended by some expatriates. Although thousands attended that conference and opposed the government and its programs, the government's view was that that was their right, but some of those who came from abroad to attend the conference openly called for and expressed their belief in armed action to fulfill their political convictions. It is the government's duty to prevent such action, which would be a threat to peace and security in a country that has historically suffered the calamities of futile and unjustified internal and external wars. In discharging our duties as a government we arrested seven of these warmongers. Two of them have since been released. The other five will stand trial. [Khalifah] You have postponed the parliamentary and presidential elections several times. Has a final date been set for that? [Seyoum] The elections were postponed because of known compelling reasons related to the strengthening of democracy in a country that is experiencing democracy for the first time ever. It has been decided to hold the elections next June. Then the permanent constitution will be drawn up. It will be the first in the history of Ethiopia's pluralistic rule. [Khalifah] Eritrean President Isayas Afewerki has spoken of difficulties in his country's relations with Sudan. How would you describe your country's relations with Sudan? Are there difficulties there too? [Seyour] We have, over the past two and a half years, been trying hard to normalize relations with Sudan and we will continue to do so despite some problems with these relations. Unless these problems are solved, we expect more difficulties and they would become public as in the case of Eritrean-Sudanese relations. [Khalifah] What is the nature of your problems with Sudan? [Seyoum] The same kind of problems Afewerki spoke about when addressing his relations with Sudan, which supports religious groups to undermine security and stability in the neighboring countries, and we are one of these countries. We would, of course, like Sudan to think hard before extending these practices to the neighboring countries. We can live with Sudan and others in peace only when each side keeps its convictions, views, and ideologies within its own borders. [Khalifah] Has the Eritrean Government given you the details of its problems with Sudan before or after recent developments? [Seyoum] Exporting trouble to Eritrea or any state bordering on Sudan would certainly affect us and we should of necessity have knowledge of its details and developments. In our relations with Sudan we are also suffering, the same as Eritrea. So long as Sudan pursues these policies in Eritrea it would naturally pursue them in our country. Despite all that, we do not believe that this situation has asssumed major proportions but we want it to end in the interests of both countries. We are discussing these matters with Sudan with complete frankness and clarity in order to iron out these problems. [Khalifah] Have your ties with the Western states suffered as a result of your relations with Sudan when they were good? [Seyoumr] We have always discussed with the West our relations with Sudan, and we have always sought to contribute to the normalization of relations between Sudan and others. Sudan has no other option. As regards the West's contribution to our country's economy, we are fully satisfied with Western and U.S. aid and are trying to use that aid in rebuilding our country, which was devastated by internal and external problems and wars that are now things of the past and will not be repeated. [Khalifah] Have all the Ethiopian refugees returned to their country? [Seyoum] We are working with the United Nations for the voluntary return of all the Ethiopian refugees. About 13,000 of them returned from Sudan last year and large numbers returned from Kenya and Djibouti. We seek to support the returnees and encourage the return of the others. [Khalifah] Is your country continuing its efforts to solve the Somali problem, having failed in its latest efforts to achieve that objective? [Seyoum] Although we cannot do for Somalia more than we have done and are doing, we are definitely interested in Somalia's security and stability because there are about 1 million Ethiopian Somalis and about half a million Somali refugees in our country. That is why an effective solution for the Somali problem would very much interest us, not least because of its importance for the security and stability of our country and the region and for the preservation of its resources.
