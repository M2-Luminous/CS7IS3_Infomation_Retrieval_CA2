One of the measures proposed by some government officials, but still not digested by the economic team, would be to convene a meeting of economic interest group representatives to discuss the implementation of the URV [Real Value Unit]. The issue will be discussed with Minister Cardoso early next week, but one of the ministers supporting the proposal thinks the moment is excellent "to convene entrepreneurs and workers for a debate and avoid negative reactions against any unpopular decision" such as the adjustment of salaries by an average indicator, for instance. Repercussions Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Federal Administration Minister Romildo Canhim, Industry and Commerce Minister Elcio Alvares, Labor Minister Walter Barelli, and Civil Household Chief Henrique Hargreaves began articulating the first lines of an action plan to guarantee governability and maintain the government's credibility until the election. One of the ministers confided that the negative repercussions [of the latest incidents involving the president] were big and unexpected and the government understood it needed to act swiftly. The key rule on 18 February was act to united until the economic plan is approved. There were quiet meetings and conversations all day. Canhim met Cardoso. Alvares and Barelli talked personally more than once, and even Hargreaves, who was being treated for a back problem, participated through the telephone. All the ministers agreed that Franco's remarks during an interview were an attempt to take the Lilian case out of the headlines, although some of them also admitted that the tactic used was not a very good one. That was the reason behind the joint effort to help the finance minister. The news that spread around Brasilia saying the finance minister traveled to Juiz de Fora on the night of 17 February to meet the president was not confirmed, but not a single minister denied the meeting had actually occurred, either. One of them only said that the minister had travelled, while another only admitted knowing about Cardoso's temporary "disappearance," although accepting that no plan can be implemented without the president's previous consent. `Tricked' The first step is the immediate entry of all ministers in the battle for votes, to convince congressmen that the Lilian case "is an incident lost on the horizon," and that the launching of Fernando Henrique Cardoso's candidacy has not really occurred. The agreed-upon version will be that in both cases the president was "tricked." At Carnival, by the model, and at the news conference, by reporters, who did not understand what he really meant. Besides, in the past couple of days important congressional leaders, such as Senator Jarbas Passarinho and Marco Maciel, were contacted with the purpose of creating an environment favorable to the government, in the sense that there is no way now to explain to the country a negative position on a proposal that was approved when it was voted on in general terms.
