Li Peng said in his motion: To meet the requirements of establishing a socialist market economic structure; promote reform of the labor system; protect laborers' legitimate rights and interests; establish, safeguard, and develop a stable and harmonious labor relationship between employers and laborers; and promote economic development and social progress, the Ministry of Labor and departments concerned have drawn up a draft labor law. The draft has been discussed and adopted by the State Council's executive meeting. Entrusted by the State Council, Labor Minister Li Boyong briefed the meeting on issues concerning the draft labor law. Li Boyong said: In compliance with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's direction on formulating a labor law, which he proposed at a central work conference, the former State Bureau of Labor had initiated the drafting of a labor law with departments concerned. Over the past decade or so, the draft has been revised over 30 times following a great deal of investigations and studies as well as repeated assessments. Since the 14th CPC Congress, the Bureau of Legislative Affairs under the State Council, the Ministry of Labor, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions have further studied, assessed, and revised the draft law. Presently, various departments are of the opinion that it is extremely necessary and imperative to formulate a labor law; conditions are ripe for this work. Li Boyong said: It is necessary to draw up a labor law to protect laborers' legitimate rights and interests and maintain a stable and harmonious labor relationship between employers and laborers. Since reform and opening policies were adopted, China's non-publicly-owned economic sectors have developed significantly, and publicly-owned enterprises are also stepping up the pace of changing operating mechanisms; thus the labor relationship is becoming more complicated and diversified. In the course of such a profound transformation, a sound and perfect development in labor legislation is, in an objective sense, necessary for correctly readjusting and safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of both sides of a labor relationship and for resolving contradictions between employers and laborers; it is very pressing to keep laborers' legitimate rights and interests from being infringed upon through legislation. In fact, the practices of extending laborers' working hours at will, cutting their wages, rejecting necessary labor protection for them, and even humiliating and physically punishing workers, which lead to seriously vicious incidents, have been frequently reported in some localities and enterprises, particularly nonpublicly owned enterprises, in recent years because a law that will provide better protection for laborers' legitimate rights and interests is absent. Some foreign-invested enterprises openly harmed laborers' interests under the pretext that there is no labor law in China, deteriorating the labor relationship and disturbing social stability. Many deputies and members from every past term of people's congress and committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference have submitted motions and suggestions for accelerating the legislation of a labor law. He said: Formulating a labor law is a pressing need for developing a socialist market economy. Under the market economic structure, a market is required as a basic means for allocation of the labor force. As the market economy develops and labor reform deepens, China is gradually improving its labor system, developing it in the direction of requiring a market to allocate the labor force; the development, allocation, and employment of the labor force are markedly more commercial and social; and openness and competition in the labor market are increasingly prominent. These developments objectively lead to the requirement that all aspects of the labor relationship be incorporated into the track of market operations. The behavior, rights, and obligations of the subjects in a labor relationship, as well as the order of the labor market, need to be standardized and safeguarded by law. Therefore, we badly need to draw up a labor law. In his briefing, Li Boyong also elaborated on the guiding ideology for legislating the draft labor law, to what extent it is applicable, labor contracts, cutting staff and workers, working hours, and other issues.
