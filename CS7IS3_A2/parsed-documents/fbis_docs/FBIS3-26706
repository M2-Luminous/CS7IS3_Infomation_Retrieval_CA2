An epoch-marking event happened that day in Haicang, which has been undergoing development for more than 300 years. That day, Zhu Rongji, Standing Committee member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice premier of the State Council, once again inspected Haicang. That was his third visit to Haicang, which he previously inspected in March and July 1992. A noticeable fact was that Vice Premier Zhu Rongji also brought the principal leaders of more than 10 state departments, including the State Planning Commission, the Economic and Trade Commission, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, and the Ministry of Finance before the expiration of the land use agreement for the "901 Project," to which 20 square kilometers of land was allocated. Such a large-scale and high-level group of state leaders coming to see an investment and development zone had not been seen in the past. This showed that the party and state leaders attach great importance to the development of Haicang. Of course, as some relevant analysts have concluded, this also indicated that a final decision on the use of the 20-square-km land preserved for the project launched by Taiwan Plastics would soon be made. Haicang's development will then enter a new stage. The state authorities attached great importance to every step of Haicang's development from the planning stages to the initial construction. On 20 May 1989, the State Council issued an official document, approving the establishment of a special investment zone for Taiwan investors in the Xiamen Special Economic Zone and in the districts of Xinglin and Haicang, and investment projects inside the zone will enjoy favorable policy treatment. In January 1990, the State Council named the area of 100 square kilometers in Haicang for the investment project of Taiwan Plastics "901 Project," and a special leading group was set up to handle this matter. On 2 February 1990, Comrade Li Ruihuan inspected Haicang, and praised the advantageous conditions there. He proposed that the delimitation of the administrative districts should serve the purpose of economic development. On 24 February 1990, Premier Li Peng braved the rain to inspect Haicang and instructed Haicang to "break conventions and adopt special measures to deal with special matters" in its development. He also immediately decided that the State Council would arrange some loans as start-up funds. Between 16 and 20 September, Comrade Qiao Shi inspected Haicang and listened to work reports by local leaders. Between 17 and 19 March 1992 and between 2 and 4 July 1992, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji flew to Haicang twice to handle some affairs in Haicang's construction. He instructed the departments concerned to effectively carry out their tasks, thus creating conditions for large-scale development. Party and state leaders Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, Yang Shangkun, Yao Yilin, Zou Jiahua, and Wang Zhaoguo frequently met with leading overseas businessmen in order to promote Haicang's development... In the last few years, Haicang continued to be a key focus of the people's attention. On 4 February, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji led nearly 100 leaders from all the relevant State Council departments and the relevant institutions of Fujian Province and Xiamen City to Haicang by ship. On the ship, the leaders first listened to the report about the construction of Haicang Bridge. At about 1000, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji and his entourage stepped onto Congyu Pier in the southwest part of Haicang. They first inspected the project of the Congyu Power Station, which was under full-scale construction. The first phase of the project will enable the power plant to generate 600,000 kilowatts of electricity. There, the leaders expressed gratitude and appreciation to the cadres and workers who were working hard on the construction side. The motorcade then moved along the broad new roads, Maqing Road and Wengjiao Road, and successively visited the construction site of Xianglu Polyester Fiber Textile Plant, which would produce 180,000 tonnes of polyester products a year, the new downtown area of Haicang, the new office building of the Haicang Management Committee, and the Xinyang Industrial District. On the construction site of Xianglu, Vice Premier Zhu talked cordially with the project's responsible people and inquired about the project's progress and the difficulties they were facing. Vice Premier Zhu indicated that the state authorities would, as usual, continue to help Haicang solve problems in its construction. In the Haicang Management Committee's office, Vice Premier Zhu listened to the responsible officials' work reports about the planning for the construction of the investment zone and the conditions of the construction projects. He fully affirmed Haicang's changes and developments and said gladly that, as compared with the conditions in 1992, Haicang's transformation and development are indeed impressive. During his inspection tour, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji expressed important opinions on Haicang's construction and development in the next stage. In particular, he changed the name of the "Haicang Taiwan Investment Zone" officially used by the State Council's 1989 document into the "Haicang Project Investment Zone." This showed that the Haicang Investment Zone would be further opened to investors from all parts of the world, and would welcome investors from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and overseas areas, and it would not be simply opened to Taiwan investors. On the other hand, this indicated certain major and large-scale projects would be introduced to Haicang. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji also instructed that the construction of Congyu Power Plant and the coal dock in Congyu be quickened in order to strengthen the infrastructure facilities, and that the civil engineering part of the Xianglu polyester project be carried out intensively, and that the equipment be installed properly to that it may be put into operation according to schedule. At the same time, efforts should be continued to advance the preliminary and preparatory work of other projects, thus creating a new situation in Haicang's development.
