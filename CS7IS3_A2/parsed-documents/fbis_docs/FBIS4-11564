FBIS4-11564 "drlat083_c_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-083 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 MEXICO Zedillo Letter on Presidential Debate Zedillo Letter on Presidential Debate PA2804233794 Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 26 Apr 94 p 10 PA2804233794 Mexico City LA JORNADA Spanish BFN [All quotation marks as published] [Text] Yesterday, PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon said 3 May "appears to me to be a very good date" to hold a debate with PAN [National Action Party] presidential candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos. Meanwhile, PRI leader Fernando Ortiz Arana reported the date had been accepted. Zedillo also said "it is a very astute proposal" for the debate to take place at the National Chamber of Radio and Television Industry (CNIRT), indicating he was "waiting for additional details." Former PRI candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio had said the appropriate location for this type of event should be the Federal Electoral Institute to distance the event from special interests. In the evening, the PRI candidate sent a letter to Cuauhtemoc Cardenas [presidential candidate for the Party of the Democratic Revolution, PRD], in which he requests "a prompt reply" on the date and conditions for the debate, while he indicated that other candidates should not be disqualified from the debate. Zedillo said he does not agree "with efforts to discount other parties that represent ideological plurality and diversity in the nation's political life." In his first reference to the issue, the PRI candidate replied as follows from his party's headquarters: I am waiting for the candidates' reply. I will respectfully and attentively consider everything they have to say. Today, I read in the press that Fernandez de Cevallos had made two specific proposals to establish the date (3 May). In my opinion, this is very good. He added: "Another proposal is for the CNIRT to coordinate and organize the debate. This also is a very astute proposal. I will be waiting for additional details." Zedillo did not refer to any contact with Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, but Fernando Ortiz Arana said he had accepted. Ortiz Arana said: "There was a reply from the PAN and PRD candidates accepting our candidate Erneswto Zedillo's invitation to hold a debate. The important issue is that soon we will be presenting our proposals, program, and actions in a public debate, thereby keeping our commitment to the community." He added: "The two parties have accepted the proposals, and PAN candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos has proposed the date of 3 May for the debate. Our candidate and the party have accepted this, and all PRI members will be with Ernesto Zedillo at the debate he has convened." Ortiz Arana insisted that Zedillo "acknowledges the principle of equality among all candidates and hopes there will be an opportunity to debate our positions with the other candidates from all of the political parties throughout the campaign." The following is the text of a letter sent to the PRD candidate: "Engineer Cardenas: "I appreciate your reply to the invitation sent to you yesterday by Diego Fernandez de Ceballos, PAN presidential candidate, to hold as soon as possible a debate to be broadcast by radio and television. ``I am pleased to read that you have been willing to debate since November. Nevertheless, it is good to remember that it was Luis Donaldo Colosio, PRI presidential candidate, who for the first time openly and directly proposed a debate. ``Allow me to stress that the terms of my invitation are perfectly clear. I have proposed a debate between Fernandez de Ceballos, you, and me on our ideas and our political platforms. I have proposed a live and uninterrupted debate to be broadcast on radio and television within a framework of unquestionable impartiality, transparency, and equality. ``I propose we use only one single broadcast that can be received and transmitted by all television and radio stations that want to carry the debate, without favoring any specific company. In addition, conditions should be provided to allow representatives of the print media to cover the debate to their complete satisfaction. ``I believe that for the debate to be a fair political exercise that will benefit the people, the participants should be given equal time to express their ideas. Likewise, we should be given the opportunity to comment on the other candidates' responses and to issue opening and final statements. A moderator of the utmost integrity and impartiality would also help the candidates adjust to the time allotted. ``The specific terms of my invitation should correspond to a definite response. Instead, I read in your letter the following: ``It would be important, because of this type of event's widespread dissemination and because of the public's undeniable interest in such things, to consider holding several other debates. One or two of these debates could even be between just you and me because, objectively speaking, it is our proposals and what we represent that comprise the major points of contention in this campaign, and the citizens will have to decide between these two sides when casting their votes. ``In this regard, I believe it will be the citizens, by way of the free exercise of their rights, who will decide whether "objectively speaking, our proposals and what we represent is what truly is being contested in this campaign and from which the citizens will have to decide when casting their votes. ``I do not agree with your attempts to disqualify other legally registered candidates and I cannot agree with your attempts to discount other political parties that represent the ideological plurality and diversity of the nation's political life. Therefore, I reiterate that in my invitation I indicated my trust that there will opportunities to debate issues with all candidates from all parties throughout the campaign. ``In another turn of events, the above-mentioned paragraph of your letter does not indicate whether you have accepted my invitation, as, by the way, Fernandez Cevallos already has. Moreover, he proposed that the debate take place on 3 May and that it be organized by the CNIRT. In turn, I have accepted both proposals." ``Hoping to receive a prompt reply from you to my invitation made yesterday, I remain, very truly yours,'' [Signed] Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon
