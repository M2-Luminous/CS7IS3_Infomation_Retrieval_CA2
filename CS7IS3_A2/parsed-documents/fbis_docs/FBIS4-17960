Aleksandr Shokhin on the Conference of G-7 Finance Ministers"] [Text] Washington -- Although a Russian delegation's participation in the conference of G-7 finance ministers became a kind of tradition some time ago, our representatives have not for a long time enjoyed such a cordial, approving, not to say welcoming, atmosphere as the one that prevailed last Sunday [24 April] at the IMF building in Washington. Ironically apologizing for using an "excessively Soviet" word, Deputy Prime Minister A.N. Shokhin said that the support for the present Russian Government's course was "unanimous." "I was glad to see so much optimism around the table," U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the conference, commented on its conclusion. For the first time in quite a long time, Russia contributed its share of optimism to the discussion. A few days before the conference, to which world financial circles traditionally attach very great significance, IMF Executive Director Michel Camdessus had, in several public statements, imparted pleasant impressions of his prolonged visit to Russia. Whether he had been too alarmed beforehand by newspaper reports in which the broad shoulders of V. Zhirinovskiy overshadowed the country's entire political scene, or whether the departure of several young reformists from the government had been seen as a fatal blow to market freedom, in any case the contrast proved striking, and M. Camdessus' remarks exuded what in Soviet times used to be called a "sense of deep pride and legitimate satisfaction." Not only did the "long hours of talks" with Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin convince the IMF executive director of the government's commitment to reforms, but also the meetings in the State Duma, far from ruining this general impression, actually added to the optimism, since he recognized that there are some very responsible and knowledgeable people in the Duma. No Doubts About the Course of Reforms "At Sunday's G-7 meeting unanimous support was expressed for the Russian Government's course," A. Shokhin said at a meeting with Russian journalists on Tuesday [26 April]. "This was expressed in the fact that the IMF board of directors granted the second part of the credit for systemic transformations, and also in the general tone of the discussion compared with the meeting at Kromberg in February of this year. At that time the discussion concerned whether the (Russian) government intended to continue the course of reforms at all. But this time what was discussed was pragmatic problems such as providing the conditions for an influx of private investments into Russia, the creation of favorable tax and customs regimes for such an influx of investments, and the problem of insuring investments in Russia against political risks." A second group of questions under discussion was connected with the creation of nondiscriminatory regimes in commodity markets that are fundamental for us --aluminum, uranium, space launches, etc. "It is a question of creating a universal legal base whereby Russia would be seen as a country with a transitional economy, not a country with a centralized state system of trade and economy," A. Shokhin explained. "That way exactly the same criteria would be applied to it as to any other country." In this connection the Russian delegation expressed an "urgent desire" for Russia finally to be freed from the Jackson-Vanik amendment. Its political aspect consisted in pressure on governments that do not allow their citizens freely to leave their country and return there. In A. Shokhin's opinion, this simply does not apply to present-day Russia. But the economic aspect of the amendment is that a discriminatory regime could be applied against our country at any moment. And that creates an off-putting atmosphere for investors. World Bank for a Plant Kindergarten The third of the main questions at the conference concerned reorienting the package of support for the Russian reforms. The package was announced earlier, but a significant part of it was not brought to bear on developing the system of social protection for the population. "We discussed a possible mechanism for this switch. Specifically, it was said that for a transitional period local budgets should receive specific financial help, and backing should be given to federal programs such as a program of support for coal-mining regions," A. Shokhin said. This had been said before, but the novelty of the vice prime minister's information was that henceforth, World Bank credits will be applied to such purposes. The Russian delegation submitted a number of proposals in connection with the activity of the so-called Paris Club -- representatives of the group of creditor countries. "At the moment we have a temporary situation, we are making payments for 1994 in line with the 1993 agreement, which has been extended to 1 May. In the light of our budget's potential, we need a better agreement than the one that existed in 1993." By "better" the vice prime minister clearly meant more favorable terms for Russia, but would the creditors agree to this? "There is an understanding," A. Shokhin said, somewhat vaguely. Russia also raised the question of its new status in the Paris Club as not only a debtor country, but also a creditor country. "Very many developing countries have debts to us, as the Soviet Union's successor," A. Shokhin said. "We are the chief creditor of, for instance, Vietnam, Ethiopia, and others. In this connection we do not insist on full membership, but, for instance, observer status. That would be appropriate to Russia's real position." A. Shokhin said that, in discussing questions of collaboration with ministers from the world's seven most developed countries, "we emphasize in every way that Russia holds a special position. On the one hand it is, so to speak, petitioning for support for the reforms and systemic transformation in Russia, but on the other hand it is a donor -- in particular to countries that were formerly republics of the Soviet Union. The scale of this aid is vast, and it is a heavy burden on the budget, and this is done not because of any imperial ambitions on Russia's part, but for very simple reasons -- you cannot cut off the gas in winter, you cannot leave those states without heat or electricity. Therefore, Russia is obliged to "supply them with relatively cheap and sometimes free resources." [quotemarks as published] "In this context we would also like to support a system proposed by the IMF executive director," A. Shokhin continued. "What I am referring to is that Russia could offer credits to the CIS states jointly with other willing countries, but formally it would be in the form of credits from international financial organizations. We would thereby clear ourselves of possible accusations of imperial aspirations, and on the other hand increase repayment guarantees, because the credits would have the status of credits from international financial institutions." Near the end of the session, a piece of news that everyone found alarming arrived from Moscow. News agency cables reported that the Duma, with the government's consent, had increased the country's expenditure budget by 8 trillion rubles -- such a substantial sum that the threat of inflation could have spoiled the good impression that everyone had received of the new approaches in Russia. "We spent half the day today explaining what all this meant," A. Shokhin said with a smile. "We explained to everyone, including Camdessus himself." "It is true that the budget figures have `changed somewhat,'" the vice prime minister noted. But what happened was in the main a technical adjustment. We decided to release credits to agriculture -- about 6 trillion rubles -- not through the Central Bank and commercial banks, which is a long road, and experience shows that here there are many abuses and improper use of the credits. The commercial banks make the credits work for them before directing them to the countryside. And we have decided to do it in the form of budget appropriations. Overall monetary emission is not changed, but these credits, being recorded under the budget heading, increase the apparent budget deficit, but in principle, this is IMF methodology. The IMF has long been making us show these concessionary credits in the budget. Now we can dictate the terms for the expenditure of these resources." The Russian delegation set forth its position on attracting investments to Russia. "Unless, in the next few months, we can organize this influx, contradictions will arise between a relatively rigorous credit and financial policy and a deepening recession in production." A. Shokhin said that the granting of $1.5 billion for systemic transformations in the near future does not cause the slightest euphoria in the government, since this money is "already accounted for in the budget, we have already spent it" -- because the government was sure of receiving it. The question of the need to go over to medium-term payment balances -- otherwise there will be payment peaks. "For instance, this year, out of the sum of over $4 billion allocated for servicing and extinguishing the foreign debt, we are forced to spend a large proportion on servicing Russia's debts -- not the former Soviet debts. In this connection we are actively suggesting to G-7 that the borrowed credits be applied without Russian Government guarantees. Outlines have already been drawn up. In accordance with framework agreements signed in September by the U.S. `Eximbank' and the corresponding Russian organizations, the Central Bank of Russia and the Finance Ministry offer so-called comfort terms for foreign investors. True, at the moment this only applies to the oil and gas sector. But the comfort is expressed in the fact that guarantees can be offered against credits, these guarantees can be sold for rubles, rubles can be converted into foreign currency, and foreign currency can be repatriated." Thus, instead of government guarantees, which are expressed in the formula "if an enterprise does not pay for itself, we will pay," new guarantees are appearing: You can demand that the enterprise, the Central Bank, and the Finance Ministry fulfill quite specific conditions. In particular, the Finance Ministry must, under this contract, compensate foreign investors for less favorable taxation conditions or other things connected with a change in legislation. "Many people are prepared to work with us on these terms. We are now holding talks with the Italians and the Germans," the vice prime minister concluded, clearly satisfied with the results of the conference of the G-7 finance ministers in the U.S. capital.
