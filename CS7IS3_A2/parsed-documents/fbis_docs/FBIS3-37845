"The Bosnian crisis was a test of the firmness of our course in the world which showed the true potential of the Russian foreign policy", Yeltsin said at a meeting with Moscow teenagers studying in military colleges. "In close cooperation with the United Nations and our partners we shall boost the peaceful offensive. The objective is that the ceasefire in sarajevo becomes a breakthrough to peace in the whole of Bosnia", the president stressed. The crisis tested "our capability to resolutely defend the national and state interests of the country. Russia, as a UN Security Council member, as an equal participant of the community of democratic states demonstrated its right to participate in adopting key decisions of the world politics... which concern its lawful interests and international obligations. Our voice was heard in the world", the president said. "The mechanism of partnership with the West was also tested. Although not immediately, with faults, but it did work", the president said adding that Russian stance on dialogue and cooperation with leading powers of the world has justified itself. "The Sarajevo crisis has also spotlit the correctness of our course towards all-round strengthening of the United Nations as the major international organisation in ensuring peace", Yeltsin stressed. As a result a ceasefire in Sarajevo was achieved without a further escalation of the military conflict, according to the president. "The logics of peace must, finally, win over nationalistic emotions which brought the peoples of Bosnia-Herzegovina to the top limit of human sufferings", Yeltsin said. The president expressed hope that the conflciting sides would stand up to their commitments, ensure a reliable ceasefire and avert provocations against international peace-keepers, including the Russian force in Sarajevo.
