For several months American police have had information that an international gang has succeeded in using Cyprus to launder a large amount of money received from the sale of drugs. According to our information, the American police and the Cypriot police are cooperating to investigate this case and locate the people behind it. In the past, Cyprus has been used to transfer dirty money overseas, a case in which Canadian police showed great interest. Cyprus is being used as a transit point in the drug trade, but recently it has developed a market of its own. Many illegal trade gangs prefer Cyprus because it is very easy to "legalize" their money.
