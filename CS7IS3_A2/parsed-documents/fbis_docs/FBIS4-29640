The sources said late Monday Pyongyang's First Vice Foreign Minister Kang Sok-chu said in a June 3 statement that North Korea will not divert to military use any radioactive material from fuel rods withdrawn recently from an experimental nuclear reactor. In the statement, Kang asserted it is still possible to test the spent fuel rods to ensure that no plutonium has been diverted to military purposes. Kang urged the U.S. to resume talks with Pyongyang in order to reach a package solution to the nuclear issue but also said economic sanctions would be regarded as a "declaration of war." During refueling operations of the research reactor in the Yongbyon nuclear complex some 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang last month, North Korea rejected demands by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors that they be allowed to take samples from the 8,000 rods being withdrawn. North Korean officials said it was setting aside 40 rods for testing later by the IAEA inspectors, but the Vienna-based U.N. monitoring agency rejected the offer as insufficient to ensure the continuity of the safeguards agreement. The U.S. and other Western nations suspect that Pyongyang may be attempting to build an atomic weapons arsenal and are threatening U.N. sanctions if it continues to reject IAEA demands for checks. Pyongyang insists that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but its intransigence over the inspections has fueled suspicions it may be trying to conceal a weapons development program. Washington is offering to resume high-level talks with Pyongyang but wants to see a freeze on the suspected North Korean nuclear program. This would include allowing two IAEA inspectors to remain in North Korea, no reprocessing of the discharged fuel rods and no reloading of the Yongbyon reactor. Kang suggested in the June 3 statement that when a comprehensive resolution to the issue is reached with the U.S., North Korea would allow regular and special IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities, return to the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and change to the safer light-water type of nuclear reactor.
