Greek European Affairs Minister Theodhoros Pangalos could not hide his vexation as he told the press: "The result was not positive this evening, I am sorry to say, and I do not understand why." He could only draw a favorable conclusion from talks in other areas still outstanding, such as agriculture, the budget, and regional policy. Since no compromise solution seems possible in the immediate future, Mr. Pangalos, whose country currently has the EU presidency, decided to reconvene the ministers in Brussels next Tuesday, with the firm intention of settling the bones of contention that separate the United Kingdom and Spain from their 10 partners. Between now and then, he hopes that the contacts that ministers are sure to have with their respective heads of state and government will make it possible to smooth out the differences that are still preventing the formal conclusion of the membership negotiations for the four candidate countries (Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway). This is already the second time that the talks have been postponed, with the Twelve and Norway being forced to separate last Tuesday on a note of disagreement. Since then, Oslo has made overtures to Spain and Portugal by giving their trawlers a little more access to its rich fishing grounds. According to Piet Dankert, Netherlands state secretary for foreign affairs, Portugal seems ready to reconsider its position, but Spain remains unconvinced and has a problem with the respect of its "historic rights" to fish in the Norwegian waters, abolished by Oslo in 1981 because of the depletion of fish stocks. The president of the European Commission, Jacques Delors, intervened in the debate to try and get the EU out of this rut, in particular by proposing the purchase of fishing quotas in the waters of third countries such as Canada and Russia and the termination in 1996 of the transition period decided when Spain and Portugal joined the Community in 1986, this condition initially restricted both these countries to 300 trawlers authorized to fish in Community waters until the year 2003. However, a number of countries, including France refused bluntly to accept this proposal: "We were unable to obtain a mandate for the renegotiation of the membership treaty for Spain and Portugal," explained Mr. Lamassoure. Added to this is the problem of adapting the minority veto in the Council of Ministers with the arrival of the four new members. The United Kingdom and Spain, and to a lesser extent Italy, demanded that this minority remain at 23 votes, which would make it easier to block Council decisions. The nine other delegations wanted it increased to 27 votes by simple mathematical extrapolation, in accordance with the mandate of the European Council summit of Lisbon in June 1992. Italy finally agreed to a compromise proposal presented by the Greek presidency which suggested a minority veto of 27 votes but with the political undertaking that a consensus would be sought if there was a minority veto of 23 votes. Spain and the United Kingdom, however, remained unbending. Hope now lies in calming the concerns being expressed by the governments. However, Mr. Dankert stated that "while last Tuesday it seemed that the foreign ministers could not reach an agreement on the Council voting balance, it is possible that the debate could be switched in the very short term to the level of the European Council." Several delegations had harsh words for the stance being taken by the United Kingdom and Spain. Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes, speaking on BRTN [Dutch- language Belgian Radio and Television]: "Certain Member States want to transform the EU into a fish shop. Too much, it is too much." Alain Lamassoure, the French minister for European affairs, stated: "Now the moment of truth has come, we are seeing who really does and does not want enlargement (...). For certain countries, the EU enlargement is being seen as the opportunity to complicate or even paralyze Community life." This second breakdown in negotiations directly poses the question of the attitude of the European Parliament (EU), which wanted to have a membership treaty fully drawn up and ready for 10 March, that is Thursday, at the latest, so that a decision could be taken at May's session which is the last one before June's European elections. The European commissioner charged with the enlargement issue, the Netherlander Hans Van den Broek, was expected to address the EP on Wednesday where he is to ask the European deputies to grant a "period of grace" of five days for submitting these documents.
