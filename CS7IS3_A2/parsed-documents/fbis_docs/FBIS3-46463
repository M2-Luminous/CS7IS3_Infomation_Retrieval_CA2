First came the accusation of a secret deal, which is now said not to exist. Then, yesterday a bizarre dispute erupted over a change of name. Given these developments over the past few days, the casual observer could be forgiven for thinking that the long-running dispute over funding of the Chek Lap Kok airport project has turned into something of a farce. Both sides must share some of the responsibility. The Government certainly seems to have paid too little attention to the debt issue which was the cause of the most recent war of words. When Executive Councillor Edward Chen Kwan-yiu accurately predicted last summer that a dispute would arise precisely over the definition of government debt, Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod promptly shot such a notion down. At the time, Mr Chen warned that China would insist debts incurred by the Mass Transit Railway Corporation and Airport Corporation be included in the $5 billion limit laid down in the Memorandum of Understanding on the new project. Mr Macleod, as he was then, denied this, saying there was no reason to make such a presumption. Perhaps the administration also under-estimated the difficulty of explaining the difference between government debt, and that of its statutory corporations, to Chinese officials unused to drawing such fine distinctions over the financial liabilities of their own companies. Whatever the faults of the Hong Kong administration, the events of the past few days clearly show that the greater blame must lie on the Chinese side. First, there was Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office chief Lu Ping's claim of a secret deal over the definition of government debt--which the vehemence of subsequent British denials strongly suggest was a fabrication. Perhaps Mr Lu thought he could pull a fast one, by claiming to have reached an agreement with Sir Percy Cradock, the one British official who has since broken ranks with his government's policy. He calculated badly, judging from the speed with which Sir Percy issued a denial. Then came yesterday's absurd allegation that Britain had changed the name of the Airport Authority to Airport Corporation, simply to avoid consulting China over its debt. Absurd because the Government has already told Beijing it is happy to use whichever title it likes. Such outbursts suggest that China is more interested in placing obstacles on the flight path to Chek Lap Kok than in seeing it built. This can only cast doubt on the sincerity of its commitment to separate the airport from political issues. There was a time, late last year, when the Chinese did seem genuinely committed to the Chek Lap Kok project, even signalling approval for some steps that were necessary, just as the political reform talks broke down. But the events of the past few days have shattered any such illusions. The Government has few options. Some argue the administration should abandon its seemingly-endless wait for Chinese approval, and simply go-it-alone, loans and all. While that may sound tempting in some sectors, it would breach the Memorandum of Understanding where consultation between both sides is crucial. Similarly, privatisation, while superficially attractive, can only further enrage Beijing, which has already expressed concern about the project slipping out of Government control. With those two options not without problems, the Government has little choice but to proceed with its present piecemeal approach of continuing to seek funds when needed from the legislature while seeking to reach an overall agreement on funding from China. It may not be a pleasant option, but the hard reality is that there is no real alternative course of action.
