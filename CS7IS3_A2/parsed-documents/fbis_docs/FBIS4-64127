Calling them "unconstitutional", Deputy Valentin Martemyanov (Russian Communist Party) proposed that the president's documents should be debated at the chamber's plenary meeting. However, his proposal failed, collecting only 167 votes in support. Therefore, the item worded by the legislator as "unconstitutional decrees by the president and measures to stop them" was not put on the agenda of the meeting. However, analysts believe that the attack on Yeltsin's economic decrees is not the last one.
