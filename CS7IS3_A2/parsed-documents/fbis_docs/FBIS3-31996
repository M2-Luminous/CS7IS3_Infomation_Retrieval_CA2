Fenasteg Secretary General Armando Sanchez told ACAN-EFE that the strike is general (and requests a 40-percent salary increase), while government sources said it has had no effect. Fenasteg stressed that some 140,000 government and municipal employees are on strike as of 0800 hours local time (1400 GMT) and will stage demonstrations on the capital's main access routes to block traffic. For its part, the National Federation of Public Employees Unions (Fenasep), a public administration labor union which does not support the strike, reported that the strike is partial. Presidency Secretary General Hector Luna Troccoli, told the media that the strike will have no repercussions on the government, as it is backed by a "minimal number of workers," those who maintain a radical position and exert pressure without exhausting the possibility of a dialogue. Luna said the strike will not undermine the development of the referendum, to be held next Sunday, through which the reforms to the Constitution should be ratified or rejected. The reforms include the possibility of moving up the elections to elect a new Congress and Supreme Court of Justice. The official advised that, if the public employees carry out actions that "clash" with the law, they will be punished. He reiterated that the government will not grant any salary increase to the workers because the state has no funds to meet those demands, which shall be discussed by the Labor Ministry Commission for Salary. This is the first labor movement to confront the administration of Ramiro De Leon Carpio, who took office in June 1993, after Jorge Serrano was overthrown following his failed self-inflicted coup in May. The National Transportation Confederation (CNT), also announced that it will stage a general strike on 1 February to demand that the government authorize an increase in the rates for their service. The CNT gathers passenger and fuel transportation enterprises, which will mean a lack of fuel supplies and the resulting paralysis of industrial and commercial activities in the capital.
