The Signing by Presidents of Russia and Latvia of Accords on Russian Troops Withdrawal From This Baltic Country Is Postponed"] [Text] The Defense Ministry of Estonia has announced that servicemen of the 114th Motorized Rifle Division of the Russian Armed Forces stationed in Tallinn conducted on 7 April practice firing on the Manchiku range on Tallinn's outskirts without permission from the Estonian authorities. Representatives of the Estonian Armed Forces were not invited to the range to observe the firing practice. "Yes, we do hold combat training sessions," Guards Colonel Yevgeniy Lazebin, the division's chief of staff, said, confirming the information. "It is not being done spontaneously but rather in line with approved plans and schedules. Servicemen perform firing drills using submachine guns, and practice grenade throwing which, incidentally, is done once every six months. Since we have not handed over the range to Estonia, it is being used for regular training sessions of which we are not supposed to notify the Estonian side," Lazebin underlined. It is not accidental that KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has to explain in such detail what appears to be a fairly banal situation involving servicemen of the Northwestern Group of Forces. It so happened that precisely the same situation that took shape two weeks earlier in Latvia led to a protest note by the Foreign Ministry of the Republic of Latvia. It maintained that during a 16 March firing practice, unsanctioned by local authorities, on the firing range of the Russian military unit stationed in Stopinskaya Volost of Riga Rayon, an incident took place between Latvian militia members and Russian servicemen. Alas, this information, too, needs some explaining. Col. Igor Golin, chief of the Northwestern Group of Forces press center, explained that the practice firing was carried out on a planned basis and had been agreed with the local authorities -- not by Russian servicemen at all, but by civilians: militarized guards hired on contract to guard the Russian military unit's storages. The Baltic states' desire to part with the Russian army as soon as possible is to be appreciated. And for as long as it remains in Latvia and Estonia, combat training will continue there. It may even drag out because both in the Baltics and in Russia there are many forces wishing to derail the dialogue between Russia and the Baltic countries. As Sergey Krasavchenko, deputy head of the Russian president's staff, has stated to ITAR-TASS, "the error (in the Russian Federation president's directive No. 174 on the creation of military bases in CIS states and the Latvian Republic. -- Note by S.K.) was not technical but a political action aimed at derailing the meeting between the heads of Russia and Latvia. The aim has, unfortunately, been reached -- Guntis Ulmanis has canceled the visit to Moscow planned for 20 April.
