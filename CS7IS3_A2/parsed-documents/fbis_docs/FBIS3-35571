Yesterday morning, the secure sanctity of Prophet Abraham in the town of Hebron, near Beit al-Moqadas, went through a tragic and shocking incident in which hundreds of Muslim worshippers, while in prostration, were massacred. The catastrophe was caused by armed Zionists. These Zionist assailants continued to fire at the worshippers for a full ten minutes without any break. However, there was not shown any reaction by the armed Israeli troops who were stationed around the mosque. Every minutes 900 bullets were sprayed at the worshippers' lines, and the Zionist attackers even had enough time to reload their machineguns. The army of the Zionist regime only at the end of this heinous crime entered the scene. The troops took away the martyrs and put them in a mass grave. They also prevented blood donations to the wounded Palestinians who were transferred to a local hospital. Also by firing at the gathering of the Palestinians the military men killed and wounded scores of them. The point noteworthy in this tragic incident relates to the statement of the Zionist regime's prime minister, in which he declared that the Zionist assailant who led the group of attackers was mad. In this way, the rulers in Israel, despite having planned such a plot, have once again attributed the entire catastrophe to someone else without taking responsibility for its negative impacts. But the fact is that the mosque of prophet Abraham was under the siege and strict control of hundreds of Israeli military men [as heard]. Moreover, for months now the town of Hebron has been besieged by the Zionist troops. How then can it be imagined that, in the absence of any coordination with the Israeli Army, and while tough control was in force, several attackers could manage to massacre hundreds of people and drench the mosque compound with blood? Of course this is not for the first time that such a major catastrophe has been committed by the Zionists in the occupied Palestine. The lives of hundreds, rather thousands, of defenseless human beings constantly fall victim to the sinister designs of the Zionist occupiers. However, in the end, by attributing such a major tragedy to a crazy individual, the Zionist regime is relieved of all responsibility in this regard. Arson in the sacred Al-Aqsa mosque was attributed to a crazy man and also crushing of a number of Palestinians under the wheels of an Israeli truck was alluded to a madman in a bid to cover up such crimes. But while under international law and the provision set by the international community as well as the Fourth Geneva Convention, an occupier has full responsibility for controlling the regions under its control, the occupiers alone are answerable to any sort of insecurity in such regions. Hence any divestment of the Zionist regime's responsibility is unacceptable in legal terms. Moreover, what occurred yesterday, killing hundreds of fasting worshippers, in itself is the outcome of the Zionist regime's criminal acts. In fact, arming of the Zionist residents in various settlements and imparting military training to them are governed by a policy which is being implemented by the occupier army of Israel itself. It is a usual policy which was supplying the Jewish settlers with weapons so as to kill the Palestinians in the event of any move, even a doubtful one, does not allow the Palestinians to defend themselves and to obtain weapons for this purpose. The world people now pose this question: If the international community, through its silence and by issuing ceremonial resolutions, had not bypassed the tragedy of Palestine and if the United States, through its political, economic and military aids to and its covert and overt support for Israel, had not left it free to commit such crimes, would the oppressed nation have still become the victim of the Zionists' racist designs?
