Inevitably, many new problems have cropped up as a result, including personnel drain. The severity of this problem has deeply disturbed the relevant authorities for quite some time. In recent years, there have been cases of air force pilots being recruited by the civil aviation industry, which has shocked the air force leadership, the State Council, high-level CPC officials, and the CPC octogenarians. They gave instructions and issued orders demanding an end to this phenomenon, but the problem has yet to be thoroughly solved. Personnel Drain in the Air Force Undermines Morale According to informed sources in Beijing, civil aviation companies nationwide have been recruiting personnel from the People's Liberation Army air force since the beginning of last year in order to cover a serious shortage of pilots. As a result, over 150 trainers and new graduates from the military aviation academies and schools were engaged by those companies as pilots and ground personnel, and dozens of air force pilots ranking at and above the regiment commander level have applied for early retirement or demobilization under various "excuses" such as health reasons, after which they joined the contingent of civil aviation pilots. Throughout the year, over 500 other servicemen in the air force requested early retirement or demobilization. In order to achieve their goals, they either forged physical examination papers or became disgruntled and slacked off in their work. This has shaken the service's morale to a certain extent and has undermined the building of the air force. Under the impact of the market economy, while air force personnel are being tapped, what is happening in other fields? With the development of the economy, ocean cargo in mainland China has been growing at an annual rate of 20 percent, which urgently requires the expansion of the shipping contingent. Because the number of ocean shipping college graduates cannot meet the demand, there have also been some cases in which ocean shipping departments have recruited navy personnel. A report issued by the State Council at the beginning of this year shows that over 25 percent of the middle-aged scientific and technological personnel in the research institutes under the ministries of the State Council have left their posts or joined other trades, leaving over 20 percent of the institutes at a standstill. As many as 30 percent of the senior teachers in key middle schools in major cities have left campus. Institutions of higher learning have lost over 10 percent of their middle-aged teachers. In big cities, 30 percent of the chief physicians in hospitals have left, resulting in a serious shortage of medical staff. The number of economic and financial management personnel in the relevant departments at the provincial or ministerial level who give up their original posts to set up economic entities or accept jobs with by wholly or partially foreign-funded enterprises is constantly growing. In Guangdong Province, 30 percent of economic administration personnel at the section and bureau level have left their jobs on their own accord. In Shanghai Municipality, over 20 percent of economic administration personnel at the section level have moved into economic entities, financial departments, and wholly or partially foreign-funded enterprises. All this shows that the phenomenon of professional personnel being tapped, changing profession, or going into business is very serious. This will certainly promote the growth of new organizations which badly need professionals, but it has caused a great deal of difficulty for the organizations where these people used to work and has undermined their stability. The State Council Issues an Order Prohibiting Such Recruitment The sources said: The most important cause of such personnel drain is that new organizations do urgently need professionals, and they offer much more handsome salaries and benefits than the units where those people used to work. For example, the economic and financial management personnel from government departments receive 50 percent to over 300 percent more pay after they have transferred to wholly or partially foreign-funded enterprises. Take again the case of civil aviation departments tapping air force personnel. Figures indicate that China's aviation sector suffered from a lack of professionals for many years. Beginning in the mid-1980's, the industry grew at an annual rate of 25 percent, but the increase of professionals was only about 12 percent. Into the 1990's, the industry has maintained a growth rate of 25 percent each year, but the annual rate of personnel increase has been less than 20 percent. Hungry for qualified professionals, the industry turned its attention to the air force, flaunting its high salaries and benefits. It has been learned that the monthly salary of captains who fly the main lines of all aviation companies is normally 4,000 yuan to 6,000 yuan (renminbi, similarly hereinafter), which is equivalent to 10 or 15 times the monthly salary of an active military officer ranking at the regiment or division level. Besides, those captains are also entitled to housing, job placements for their family members, long holidays, and liberal benefits. For example, a pilot working for Air China can get extras in kind worth 3,000 yuan a year. The extras in kind that a flight attendant working for Eastern Airlines can get each year are worth nearly 5,000 yuan. Such handsome conditions are very attractive to officers on the active list, who would try every possible means to retire or demobilize earlier and join the civil aviation industry. The civil aviation industry's recruitment of pilots from the air force has shocked the air force CPC committee and high-level CPC officials, and they had to adopt countermeasures to prevent such cases from spreading. In mid-January, General Cao Shuangming, commander of the air force, announced the procedures for processing officers' applications for early retirement or demobilization at an enlarged meeting of the air force. The application for early retirement or demobilization of a cadre ranking at or above the regiment commander level must be submitted to the air force headquarters for examination and approval, and a cadre ranking at or above the division level must submit these types of applications to the general office of the Central Military Commission for review. If the reasons are found to have been fabricated or the documentation forged, they will be subject to military disciplinary action, which includes striking their names off the Army roll and expelling them from the party. In the meantime, State Council Premier Li Peng issued a "Strict Ban on Recruiting Servicemen as Civil Aviation Air and Ground Personnel." This order stipulates: Civil aviation companies are not allowed to recruit air and ground personnel of the air force on the active list for any reason; or to admit into the civil aviation industry military personnel who do not hold retirement or demobilization certificates issued by the Central Military Commission General Office, the Ministry of National Defense, or a given military region; or to recruit teachers and students of military aviation academies and schools. The Permanent Cure Is To Generate More Professionals A personality from the political circles in Beijing pointed out: The air force party committee's decision and the State Council's order will only curtail the recruitment temporarily and do not represent a permanent solution. To effect a thorough cure, it is necessary to liberate the mind, deepen reform, and bring up more professionals. This matter should be arranged by the Civil Aviation Administration of China [CAAC] under an overall plan. According to this personality, the CPC octogenarians and high- level party officials frequently discussed the issue of training the civil aviation industry's air and ground personnel. Last December, CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin instructed: "To develop civil aviation, priority should be given to training civil aviation pilots, ground technical personnel, and flight directors as well as expanding the civil aviation contingent. Only by so doing can we ensure the quality of civil aviation personnel, implement the policy of safety first, and show our commitment to the people's cause." The "Decision on Certain Questions Concerning the Establishment of the Socialist Market Economic System," adopted at the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee last November, also clearly pointed out: "The establishment of the socialist market economic system and the realization of modernization ultimately depend on the improvement of the quality of the people and the training of professionals." Therefore, "it is necessary to resort to a variety of forms and methods to bring up a large number of skilled workers and all kinds of professionals." Regrettably, this decision has not been conscientiously implemented. But there have been signs of change recently. On 21 February, the very day when the CAAC held the largest-scale flight safety work conference in the history of China's civil aviation sector, the Northwest Space Training Company [xi bei yu hang xun lian gong si 6007 0554 1342 5300 6064 4886 0361 0674], a subsidiary of Northwest Airlines of the United States, announced that it has reached an agreement with five Chinese aviation companies, Southwest Airlines, Eastern Airlines, North Airlines, Shanghai Airlines, and Xiamen Airlines, which involves training in piloting MD-82 and Boeing 757 passenger planes for the 250 pilots of these companies. This company will also undertake the training of 30 Boeing 757 flight attendants for Xiamen Airlines, and this number may be raised to 200 some time later. Now it all depends on whether or not Chen Guangyi, the newly appointed CAAC director, can seize this opportunity and push the industry's personnel training one step ahead. The personality from Beijing's political circles believed that the Army and other fields also need reforms, including the reform of salary system, to avoid personnel drain. But this depends on the vision and determination of high-level CPC officials.
