After 10 hours of negotiations, both sides have reached an agreement. The main contents of the agreement are as follows: The North and South agree to hold their summit talks in Pyongyang from 25 to 27 July, and the next summit talks will be decided during the meeting of the top leaders of the two sides in Pyongyang. We need various preparations -- such as honor guard and secret service issues -- to hold the summit talks, but these working-level matters will be discussed during the working-level contact between the North and South which is scheduled to be held at Tongilgak in the North side's area of Panmunjom on 1 July. One delegate and two associates [suhaengwon] from each side will decide on the matters after their discussions. Finally, the two sides agreed that they would make joint efforts to create a good atmosphere for the success of the North-South summit talks. The contents of the agreement are comparatively concise, but it is clear that they have reflected the firm will of the leaders of the two sides to make an important political decision and to create a new phase on the Korean peninsula, judging from various events that have taken place on the Korean peninsula -- such as the heightening of tensions on the Korean peninsula -- or from the long history of national division. Although the negotiations lasted a long time, the two sides made endless efforts, with their patience, to reach such an agreement. Therefore, I believe North-South relations will literally enter a new phase when the previously mentioned preparations proceed well in the future. [Reporter] What was the most difficult matter of discussion in reaching the agreement? [Deputy Prime Minister Yi] Of course, we wanted to hold the North-South summit talks in Seoul. The North side demanded from the beginning, however, that it hold the summit talks in Pyongyang. At the same time, it has expressed the will to hold it on the occasion of the 15 August event [1945 liberation from Japan]. Such positions by the North side have run counter to our side. Therefore, we had many difficulties coordinating each other's position during the contact. [Reporter] Before you took part in the contact, you said that the place for the summit talks had been proposed based on the principle of reciprocity. Then, will the next summit talks satisfy the principle of reciprocity based on the will of the leaders of the two sides? What is your judgment? [Yi] North-South talks have been held on many occasions in various fields and levels. However, in general, we have observed the principle of reciprocity. Therefore, we have proposed it this time as our principle. It is the position of the North side that both sides do not need to stick to past events, because it seems to believe that the time has come to hold summit talks between the leaders of the two sides, and the summit talks are different from the North-South talks which were held in the past.
