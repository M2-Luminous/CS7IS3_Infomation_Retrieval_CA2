Brothers and sisters, members of the National Dialogue Conference. This important gathering is a great event where Egypt's citizens of various political trends and party affiliations are meeting to formulate through their national dialogue an integrated Egyptian concept that will strengthen the march of democracy, throw light on the priorities of national action in this important phase of our history, and draw for Egypt a modern image defining the features of its future with the beginning of the 21st Century. It is of great significance that this important gathering is meeting under the banner of Egyptian patriotism. This gathering contains representatives of all society's forces and political currents. They will take part in free and clear discussions of Egypt's problems and hopes, eschewing their personal interests and rising above party ambitions. Their only motive and correct goal is to formulate a scientific and objective formula that will define for Egypt the position it deserves in a world witnessing difficult changes in which there is no place for the weak. Our meeting here today under the banner of Egyptian patriotism and at the beginning of a congress in which are participating this distinguished elite of the spheres of culture, thought, politics, and economics proves to all that the area of agreement that can encompass all these ideas is much bigger than our points of disagreement. This is because our national feeling takes precedence over any party affiliation and because in our modern age we are facing more complicated problems for which it is difficult to find correct solutions in the absence of an integrated and comprehensive concept that links politics and science in an objective way that rules out prejudgment, rigid stands, futile one-upmansship, and insistence on specific views that do not take into consideration the facts of the situation or the possible capabilities or the necessities for compatibility with a new age in which values and concepts have changed. Politics is no longer an easy task that can be pursued by one individual, regardless of how great his capability and efficiency. It has become an integrated system of work the aim of which is to optimally balance the interests of all the sections of the people in order to satisfy them by enhancing the society's resources, expanding the base of participation, instilling enthusiasm in individuals, and making intelligent political decisions through a scientific appraisal of the dimensions of situation and its problems. The National Dialogue Congress was formed to achieve this objective. Taking part in this congress are a mighty selection of politicians and party leaders, professionals, university professors, think tank specialists, representatives of professional associations and labor unions, members of the Specialized National Councils, bankers, economists, and businessmen. In the absence of such figures, political dialogue would be a futile Byzantine debate, long on rhetoric, short on reality and insight. Brothers and sisters, my abiding belief has been and still is that despite the diversity and multiplicity of political views in the national arena, we have enough in common to achieve a national reconciliation based on the agreement of all parties on the country's supreme interests. We may disagree on the pace of economic reforms, but we all agree on the need to open the door, with no restrictions or obstacles, to our national financial participation in development projects. Increased national investment means more job opportunities, less unemployment, and a growing and self-reliant economy. We may disagree on the pace of political reform, but we all agree that a multiparty system, fair elections, wider popular participation, a fair and independent judiciary, freedom of opinion and of the press, and an improved human rights environment are the underpinnings of true democracy. Our democracy should protect itself from those groups that defy legitimacy and desire to undermine Egypt's stability and democracy. We may disagree on the order of some of the national priorities, but we all agree on the need to confront the groups of violence and terror in a firm way that safeguards the stability of the homeland and respect for legitimacy. We agree to preserve national cohesion and social peace, aware as we are of the danger involved in ignoring the social dimension of development. From this perspective, brothers and sisters, I called for the formation of a preparatory National Dialogue Committee. My aim was to unleash initiative, to initiate a dialogue of the minds, and to have all the legitimate and democratic forces participate in a comprehensive national dialogue. The task of this dialogue is to digest the harvest of the years, evaluate the accomplishments of the present, draw up the path of the future, and illuminate our passage into the 21st Century. The objective of the dialogue was to obtain an accurate assessment of the priorities for national action in light of the prerequisites of the comprehensive development. The objective behind the dialogue was to enable us to organize and promote the effectiveness of the capabilities of the Egyptian human beings, energies, and resources so that they could confront the challenges of a new era. Furthermore, the objective was to ensure the broadest participation in drafting the political decisions and at finding sound solutions to the problems of this society. We have not put any preconditions to the dialogue preparatory committee. But we requested that the participants open-mindedly realize the nature of the challenges facing Egypt and that they be fully aware of the circumstances that govern Egypt's international and regional relations. The participants should refrain from embarking on any adventures without thinking first, as this could harm the homeland's security and stability. We did not want this dialogue to get caught in a vicious circle or get lost in a jungle of new problems that could plunder the homeland's security and stability. We did not prohibit anyone from saying whatever he wants nor did we ask anyone to change his ideas and opinions. But we asked everyone to enter the dialogue with mature minds and open hearts that could create a healthy atmosphere for an objective exchange of ideas to safeguard the homeland's interests and preserve its coherence. It has always been our hope that the circle of participants would expand to include all the democratic and legitimate forces, that everyone would rise up to meet their responsibility, and that everyone would drop any preconditions for the dialogue. This would expand the arena of national accord and promote the chances of joint action. This is because the dialogue will lose its principal characteristic and all justifications if any specific side, including ourselves, tries to dictate its opinion to the others without sound reasoning that gives them this right and privilege. We always believed that the participation alone would create opportunities for consensus. It is participation that could pave the way for mutual understanding; and it is the one thing that plants the roots of mutual confidence in the soil of national action. We are not after booty to be shared. We have a huge historic responsibility that cannot be the gambled on. Some people failed to understand our call for dialogue, thinking that we were forced into calling for it due to pressures resulting from terrorism, violence, or other issues. But reality was bigger than that, because the issue of terrorism was only one of many factors prompting the honest national call, which aims at convincing the opposition that it is part of the ruling body, that it must shoulder part of the responsibility, and that its ideas can be given appreciation and consideration as long as they reflect the national conscience and as long as the regime is prepared to accept its views because they reflect a broad national accord. These were the dialogue's aims and motives. However, it seems that there are those who have miscalculated and imagined matters differently. Brothers and sisters, members of the distinguished conference. This important gathering could not have taken place without good preparation. The preparatory committee has made efforts that deserve thanks and compliments. It has completed important working papers that organize the method of work in this conference of yours and its three committees. I thank the committee for the enormous efforts it made throughout four sessions that fully gave all its members a chance to put forward their views and proposals. I also thank all those who participated and contributed their efforts and thought in the work of the preparatory committee. Participation means acceptance of responsibility. It means respect for the rules of the dialogue. It means giving the correct opportunity for deepening the exercise of democracy. The fruits of the committee's work was a good example of democratic action because it enabled all views to be expressed clearly. The representatives of the participating parties expressed their parties' views with complete freedom. The representatives of professional associations expressed the views of their establishments on the many problems and issues of national work. All the participating public figures expressed their various views without intervention or guidance. The committee's work did not stop at giving a chance to all members to express their views in a democratic atmosphere and with a feeling of responsibility. It also contained an honest and accurate record of all the committee members' proposals and recommendations. Your honorable congress will discuss and adopt these recommendations. The points of disagreement and agreement on all topics under discussion must be made clear to all. This is because national consensus is the sound guideline for arranging these recommendations according to their priorities and for implementing their contents. The preparatory committee's recommendations encompass all national action issues, including economic reform, political reform, and society's basic problems of developing Egypt's manpower capability. Society must become more capable of confronting the challenges of the coming age. In many of these issues, it was clear that there was an overwhelming tendency reflecting a kind of national consensus. In other issues, there was a limited tendency that did not reach limits close to unanimity or majority of views. I believe all these issues will be discussed by your honorable congress so that it will rearrange their priorities in a way that takes into consideration the homeland's supreme interests and the degree of national consensus enjoyed by these recommendations. Your congress must also take into consideration the effect of these recommendations on society's cohesion and unity; their social, political, and economic cost; and their suitability for application and implementation under our local conditions and international developments in general. I do not wish to volunteer my opinion on a number of important issues raised by the dialogue preparatory committee so as not to hamper the free and smooth progress of dialogue in your congress. However, I would like to assure everyone that we will receive the recommendations of this congress with an open mind and will take into account every recommendation emanating from national consensus, so long as it accords with the general national interest. We want this conference to be the right starting point for comprehensive work in which all political, democratic, and legitimate forces, all of society's forces and institutions, and every citizen will take part. Our task, briefly stated, is to match rights with obligations, reconcile aspirations with abilities, and preserve social cohesion. We have to admit that the true power of any society rests on a strong economy driven by a nation fired with enthusiasm and eagerness for participation. We also have to admit that we are at the threshold of an era in which information and science are the decisive factors in national success. I implore God Almighty to guide our steps onto the path of righteousness, to endow us with objectivity and enlightenment, to let the light of faith permeate our course of reform, and to grant us the gift of harmony, cohesion, and solidarity. May peace be upon you and the mercy of God. [applause]
