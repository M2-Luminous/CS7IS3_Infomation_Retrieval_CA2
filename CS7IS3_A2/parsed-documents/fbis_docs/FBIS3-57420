Shakhray? Sergey Shakhray: `I Could Not Care Less About My Own Status'"] [Text] Sergey Shakhray, former vice premier, is now deep in thought on the issue of retaining the post of nationalities and regional policy minister in the new Cabinet. Shakhray's doubts have been brought about by a rather dubious status assigned to him in the Cabinet. Instead of "the man in charge" of regional policy, which has been Sergey Mikhaylovich's duty in the past several years, now he thinks of himself as a "front," just like Gaydar and Fedorov who have already left the government. Questions of regional and nationalities policy are now simultaneously in the "supreme jurisdiction" of two vice premiers -- Yarov and Zaveryukha. Shakhray's efforts spent over the two past years in seeking to settle relations with Tatarstan now appear to be simply undone. At present, problems related to the future treaty between Russia and Tatarstan are being discussed in other offices while the minister himself learns about them from press reports. "Only after I stated this to INTERFAX did they phone and invite me to study the draft treaty," Sergey Shakhray said in an interview with MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS. The situation that has developed over Chechnya is even more unpleasant. No one is paying attention to Shakhray's directive not to treat representatives of the Chechen government as leaders of an independent republic. Chechnya Vice Premier M. Mugadayev visits Viktor Chernomyrdin in a perfectly official capacity. "Now the regional leaders, especially from Chechnya, do not wish to talk to me. They know there is no way of fooling me," Sergey Mikhaylovich comments. Phone conferences with the regional leaders are now held behind the minister's back. "I could not care less about my personal status," Shakhray says. "But this year the fall of the ruble is threatening the collapse of Russia's state integrity. This is evident to all. It is sad to see which conflicts are brewing and know what needs to be done to `remove' them but have no real power to do so." According to Shakhray himself, he has 10 more days to think. During this time decisions on the makeup of the Council of Ministers Presidium and on the distribution of duties in the government are to be promulgated. "Then it will become clear what the composition of the executive branch will be like, and I will make the final decision," Shakhray says.
