The talks are scheduled to start around midday. Mr Meyer spoke on the NP's manifesto released earlier and said expections had been raised by media reports around the next round of talks. "It is important not to expect too much at this stage," he said. A four-point constitutional package, including a double ballot, is to be put to the Freedom Alliance on Thursday in a final attempt for an inclusive negotiated settlement. The double ballot offer by the African National Congress [ANC] -- potentially a breakthrough -- has not been seen yet and Mr Meyer expressed caution on the matter. He told SAPA he would prefer to evaluate it within the full context of any ANC proposal. If the new package succeeds, negotiators said Parliament was ready to be convened for a one-day session next week to amend the transitional constitution and the electoral act. Deputy Constitutional Development Minister Fanus Schoeman confirmed that a new and "definitely final" offer had been cobbled together by the ANC and the government which he felt substantially accommodated all the Freedom Alliance's demands. The double ballot offer, approved by the ANC's National Executive on Tuesday night, would remove what had become identified as the most problematic obstacle to any agreement, he said. Mr Schoeman said deadlock reached at the last round of talks with the alliance on Monday had resulted in an all-round, all-out attempt to find a solution. Substantial agreement had already been achieved on three of the issues which concerned provincial powers and functions, provincial taxation autonomy and constitutional autonomy for provinces, tying in the problems of the demand for an Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland] and the position of the Zulu king. The government had made a proposal which offered the Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front] an option which could ultimately accommodate its volkstaat goal.
