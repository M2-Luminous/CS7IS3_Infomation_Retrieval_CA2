FBIS4-30421 "dreas123_d_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-123 Daily Report 27 Jun 1994 South Korea Team Spirit Suspension Considered if Summit Held Team Spirit Suspension Considered if Summit Held SK2706102194 Seoul YONHAP in English 1015 GMT 27 Jun 94 SK2706102194 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, June 27 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean Government is mulling the suspension of the joint Korea-U.S. Team Spirit military maneuver tenatively set for coming November if an inter-Korean summit is realized as proposed and a breakthrough is provided in the resolution of the nuclear question. A senior official said on Monday Nuclear Affairs Ambassador Kim Sam-hun would convey this position to the United States when he visits Washington this week. His visit would be to put final touches to a Seoul-Washington stratgegy toward the third-round U.S.-North Korea high-level talks taking place on July 8. A source said the government would ask Washington not to take up the Team Spirit issue at the upcoming third-round talks since the issue of whether to resume the annual exercises hinges rather in the allevation of tension on the Korean peninsual than in the nuclear issue only. Through Ambassador Kim, the Seoul Government would also express its support for the U.S. plan to exchange permanent liaison missions between Washington and Pyongyang if North Korea firmly guarantees the transparency of their nuclear past, present and future, the official said. The government would further convey to the United States its existing stand that Seoul sees no reason why it should oppose diplomatic normalization between Washington and North Korea if North Korea resolves pending problems other than the nuclear one such as the suspension of missile exports and renouncement of terrorism. Regarding the question of replacing North Korean atomic reactors with light-water ones, a working-level meeting opening in Washington this week among South Korea, U.S. and Japan would explore the possibility of South Korea and Japan furnishing funds and the United States technical knowhow to North Korea for the project, the official added.
