All objective perception indicates that Gore is better prepared than Clinton to exercise the presidency of the United States. He has an excellent academic curriculum in the areas of law and philosophy, he served with the Army in Vietnam -- even though he always opposed the presence of the U.S. military in Southeast Asia -- he is an excellent speaker, he has never been accused of underhand business deals or of marital unfaithfulness, he is the son of a powerful and competent former senator, and he places himself in the center of the ideological spectrum. Gore is the most influential and active vice president in the history of the United States, and he is the natural Democrat successor to Clinton. The president has left him in charge of some of the sectors in which he specialized during his career. In a very short time he has conquered the foreign policy area. Latin America has become one of the areas in which Gore exercises influence since he decisively helped to guarantee the NAFTA agreement in 1993.
