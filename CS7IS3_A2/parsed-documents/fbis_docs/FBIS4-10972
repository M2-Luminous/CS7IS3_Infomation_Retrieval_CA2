The Final Act of the Uruguay Round, which I and representatives of 120 countries will sign today at a historical meeting in Marrakech, includes -- in addition to the matters regarding tariff reduction -- trade in agricultural products and the so-called new issues (services, intellectual property, and investment). The Final Act also provides for the creation of the World Commerce Organization (WCO), which is due to gradually replace GATT. Brazil was one of the original GATT signatories in 1947, and has actively engaged in all the multilateral commercial initiatives that have been launched since then. The relatively homogeneous distribution of Brazilian foreign trade among our main partners justifies the priority that we have attached to strengthening the multilateral system of commerce, with open structures and with stable rules, and to the improvement of the conditions for having access to export markets. According to figures that were recently released by the GATT Secretariat, the set of agreements to be signed in Marrakech will promote an increase in world income by at least $230 billion until the year 2005. For Brazil, the conclusion of the Uruguay Round should entail an increase of at least $2 billion annually in our foreign trade figures, in addition to the indirect earnings stemming from the growth of the world economy. The importance of the Uruguay Round for Brazil is also directly related to the implementation of a domestic commercial liberalization and deregulation program, and to the broad objective of promoting the competitive integration of our country into the world economy. In light of the current atmosphere of non- conflictive coexistence of the globalization and regionalization trends of the world economy, Brazil -- in its capacity as global trader -- is naturally interested in the consolidation of stable, balanced world trade rules. Within this context, the priority that we have attached to the implementation of Mercosur [Common Market of the South], and to a recent initiative to create a South American Free Trade Area, will supplement, yet not with an exclusionary approach, the efforts that we have made for the sake of strengthening multilateral policies in commercial relations. Despite the fact that the results of negotiation do not always fully match prior objectives, the positions that finally prevailed, particularly as concerns the regulatory side of the Uruguay Round, are convergent with our essential interests. The improvement introduced into the GATT mechanisms for the settlement of controversies, and the creation of the World Commerce Organization, will certainly contribute to consolidating a set of stable rules that will be able to substantially reduce the possibility of protectionist outbreaks and unilateral measures. The reincorporation of agricultural trade into GATT, the reversal of what has so far been an increasingly strong trend to subsidize agricultural products, the reincorporation of textile trade into GATT rules, and the gains obtained in the access to markets for some Brazilian priority products open promising prospects. In addition, despite the fact that the reduction of tariffs on important Brazilian export products, like orange juice and shoes, has not been as thorough as expected, the average reduction by approximately 40 percent of the import tariffs levied by developed countries will certainly open new prospects for the competitive sectors of our economy. Over the past few weeks, we witnessed with increasing apprehension the attempt by some countries to overcharge the agenda of the ministerial meeting in Marrakech with matters that were not included in the deliberations during the closing session of the Uruguay Round. Strong pressure was exerted to condition trade on, among other factors, the social patterns of work. Thanks to coordinated reaction by several developing countries, among them Brazil, those attempts, which in the final analysis would have exported unemployment from rich to poor countries, did not move forward. We hope the results of the intense negotiations made during the seven years of the Uruguay Round will wipe out, once and for all, the phantom, announced by so many, of the fragmentation of world commercial trends into isolated blocs, and of the untimely return to the commercial wars that marked the 1930's and which would certainly jeopardize the foundations of the new international order that we have to build in the post-Cold War world. The standing commitment of the ministerial meeting of Marrakech, that no measures that can harm or negatively affect the implementation of the results of the Round will be adopted, will be particularly relevant during the transition period from GATT to the World Commerce Organization, which will begin on 1 January 1995. During the next few months we will engage in intense information clarification work, with a view toward obtaining as soon as possible the ratification of the Final Act of the Uruguay Round. In the contacts I intend to have with Congress and with the productive sectors I will try to convey my firm idea that the World Commerce Organization will decisively promote commercial liberalization and the strengthening of the multilateral system of commerce, which are essential objectives of Brazilian foreign policy.
