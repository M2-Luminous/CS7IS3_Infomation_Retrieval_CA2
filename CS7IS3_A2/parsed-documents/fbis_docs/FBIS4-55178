This morning, Economics and Development Minister Davorin Kracun, who headed the Slovene delegation at this meeting, spoke about what actually happened at the Warsaw summit. At the same time he explained the progress of our negotiations to join GATT. Drago Flis reports: [Begin Flis recording] The E-10 group is relatively young. It pools new Eastern and Central European countries, among which Slovenia is still an observer for the time being. At the East-West conference in Warsaw, where Slovenia was represented by Economics and Development Minister Davorin Kracun, Slovenia displayed great interest in membership in the E-10 group, however, this was blocked by Italy, whose representative -- the charge d'affaires in the Italian Embassy in Warsaw -- cited instructions from Rome. This, of course, cannot signal an endless Italian objection, because other countries, including the United States and Germany, have no objections to Slovene membership, but, on the contrary, emphasize that the Slovene economic policy is one of the most successful among the new countries, that is to say, the countries in transition. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Brown promised Kracun that Slovenia will become a full-fledged E-10 member at the next session of the East-West conference, which will be hosted by the United States, and this group will thus turn into an E-11 group. The countries are preparing a partnership for development plan, which is supposed to be a sort of an economic equivalent to the military Partnership for Peace plan. According to some estimates, $200 billion of direct investments from the old, that is, developed nations gathered in the top G-7 group awaits the new countries within this scheme. Naturally, the new countries will need to be open for this, too. Slovenia is also negotiating with the still existant GATT, which will transform itself into the world trade organization, WTO. In the opinion of Minister Kracun, our country has now reached a favorable regime of protection of our own economy. For example, in agriculture, which is the most sensitive department, GATT consented to Slovenia allowing only a minimal access to our agricultural market, which will be 3 to 5 percent, with the continued existence of lists of goods, quotas [preloman], and a 27 percent tariff that will, of course, continue to protect domestic agriculture. Slovenia will observe the new norms of international trade in industrial imports, where the highest tariff is supposed to be 27 percent, while for many items the new tariff will be lower, Minister Kracun said, among other things.
