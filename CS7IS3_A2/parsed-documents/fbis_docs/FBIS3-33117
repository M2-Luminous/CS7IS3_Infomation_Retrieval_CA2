During his usual Monday news conference, Cristiani said he shared the Catholic Church's criticism of the political parties' proposals which, so far, have been vague and demagogic. [Begin Cristiani recording] I agree with San Salvador Archbishopric representatives who say the elections must be open and free. I disagree with the alleged need for pressure. I believe we all want the elections to be clean, free, honest and crystal clear. If something is brewing that could hinder the honesty of the elections, it should be disclosed, because I see no need for any pressure whatsoever. [end recording] According to Cristiani, the presence of 911 UN observers and Supreme Electoral Tribunal delegates will guarantee the honesty of the 20 March elections. He also described as unnecessary the trip by a Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front [FMLN] delegation to UN Headquarters to seek guarantees for the fulfillment of the peace agreements. [Begin Cristiani recording] I do not know what the FMLN is going to do at the United Nations. Any time they have a problem they have to go abroad to level complaints. We are all Salvadorans, and there is no need to go abroad to level complaints. The rescheduling the FMLN talks about is permanent. [sentence as heard] We are trying to fulfill the agreements as soon as possible, and to do so we must establish gradually dates and deadlines. It is a permanent effort by Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador], the FMLN, and the government. [end recording] Cristiani said among the delayed peace agreements are the total deployment of the National Civilian Police, the transference of lands, and the reformation of the judicial system.
