His dismissal by an edict of the president of the Russian Federation was arranged according to the new Russian traditions: The press knew about it before Kuntsevich's co-workers did. The formulation was also mysterious: ``for a single gross violation of his labor responsibilities.'' Isn't the president giving us to understand that Mr. Kuntsevich all but unleashed chemical war? One way or another, the general, who at first ran the military-chemical complex but then took upon himself the responsibility for its destruction, turned out to be unsuitable. Apparently, it is considered that the incident is thus closd. Vil Mirzayanov, who let the city and the world know about the existence of Russian binary weapons, can now relax: Lefortovo [prison] no longer threatens him. The moral victory of the ``military-chemical dissident'' is plain to see. As for whether the problem itself has been solved--that is still unclear: 40 thousand tonnes of chemical weapons [CW]--which is just what has been officially declared--as before have nowhere to go outside Russia, and must all the same be destroyed. Besides which, no fundamental decisions have been made about the use of more or less safe technologies for destruction of CW in Russia. One can hardly expect that just a few personnel shifts will help.
