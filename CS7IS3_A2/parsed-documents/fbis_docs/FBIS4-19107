[Begin Cetin recording] Following the two NATO operations last night, the situation is calm in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Bosnian prime minister [Alija Izetbegovic] said that there are no incidents at the moment. There is no question of mass deaths. He is the prime minister of the country; I must believe him, and so must we all. No mass killing or chemical weapons were used. Now, various countries are engaged in efforts to secure a cease-fire. He cited his conditions for a cease-fire in Gorazde because we are also conducting contacts on this matter. For a cease-fire, the Serbs must withdraw to their positions of 29 March. In other words, the Serbian units and militias must withdraw to the positions they were occupying on 29 March. He asked us to continue our contacts on this matter. He expressed the Bosnians' readiness for peace but the Serbs must definitely withdraw to their positions of 29 March. [end recording] The foreign minister stated that the initiatives on this issue will continue. Pointing out that the events in Bosnia-Herzegovina will be recorded as a black mark in history, Cetin remarked, however, that it is not right to use this as a tool for internal politics. A response must be given to each Serbian move, Cetin stressed, adding that the Serbs understand only force. Cetin said that certain private television stations in Turkey reported the use of chemical weapons and mass massacres in the region when the Serbian attacks against Gorazde began on Saturday [9 April]. He added that his contacts proved this to be untrue. Such a broadcasting concept does not exist in any part of the world, Cetin underlined. Cetin stressed that the demonstrations initiated following the Gorazde incidents could undermine Turkey's democracy and its image abroad and especially political parties should categorically avoid this. After Cetin's speech. political party groups expressed their views on the subject. Motherland Party Bitlis Deputy Kamran Inan said that the Serbs are acting with the aim of annihilating the Turkish culture in the Balkans. Inan remarked that the operations conducted by NATO air forces in the past two days are mere acts of show. [Begin Inan recording] The aim here is the creation of a great Serbia, which is the policy of Britain. Lord Owen is being used to this end. They wish to curb German influence in the north and Turkish influence in the southern Balkans by establishing the greater Serbia-Greece front. It is necessary to understand what is going on. Greece is currently engaged in preparations to block Turkey's way and possibly create a war in the Balkans. Therefore, the situation should not be viewed in its narrow framework. It is good to conduct contacts, but the important thing is to achieve results. [end recording] [passage omitted]
