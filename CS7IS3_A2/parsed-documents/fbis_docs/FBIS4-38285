FBIS4-38285 "drnes126dd_94012" FBIS-NES-94-126 Daily Report 27 Jun 1994 Palestinian Affairs Hamas Political Bureau Member on Elections Hamas Political Bureau Member on Elections PM2806112594 London AL-HAYAH in Arabic 27 Jun 94 p5 PM2806112594 London AL-HAYAH Arabic BFN [Unattributed report on interview with Dr. Musa Abu-Marzuq, member of the Political Bureau of the Islamic Resistance Movement, in Damascus; date not given] [Text] Dr. Musa Abu-Marzuq, member of the Political Bureau of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), has denied the existence in Hamas of a trend that supports the Oslo agreement or participation in the elections "at the present time." He affirmed that the Movement "is immune to division" and that its detained cadres did not sign the document pledging not to resort to violence except after the deletion of the part on support for the Oslo agreement. He said that the truce with Israel has been there since the birth of Israel and that "it did not mean recognition, just postponement of the conflict." In an interview with AL-HAYAH, Abu-Marzuq said that all the Hamas detainees had refused to sign the document, "which was rejected by Hamas because it included support (for the Oslo agreement) and nonopposition to the recent agreements between the PLO and Israel." He said that "when that provision was deleted and the old version, which the detainees used to sign, was revived, the central command in the prisons ordered the Movement's detainees to sign, with the exception of that command itself." In his interview, which was held in Damascus, the Hamas Political Bureau member reaffirmed Hamas' position on the autonomy authority, "which has not changed. We oppose it (the agreement) politically and at the popular level and we seek to mobilize the people against it in order to revoke it and preserve the Palestinian people's rights to their territory, full and undiminished." He said that the Israeli forces did not withdraw from Gaza and Jericho. We did not feel their withdrawal. They were redeployed. That is why our firm policy is to resist and confront the occupation." [quotation mark as published] Abu-Marzuq said that the expected elections in Gaza and Jericho "are bound by ceilings imposed by the Oslo and Cairo agreements. They will not be free elections and will be a violation of the Palestinian people's right to say what kind of leadership they want and what political course relects their views." He asked: "What is the meaning of elections while there is Israeli occupation and sovereignty on the ground? The elections should be rejected and there should be no participation in them. The arena is not restricted to (President) Yasir 'Arafat and Fatah. We challenge them to first hold a Palestinian referendum on the agreement itself to find out what the people think first." He said that Fatah would be risking its history and future when it comes inside [the territories] and participates in the elections. Asked about the existence of a trend in Hamas that supported participation in the elections, he replied: "The Movement's general trend and unanimous view is refusal to participate at this stage. We are not required to politicize our cadres. We want to prepare them for resistance against the occupation and for the preservation of the Palestinian people's rights." Abu-Marzuq, who visited Damascus recently and attended the meeting of the Central Command of the Alliance of Palestinian Forces [APF], said that "the truce (with Israel) has been in existence since the emergence of the enemy state. The lines between the Arab states and the enemy state are armistice lines but a truce does not mean recognition, just a postponement of the conflict." He stressed that Hamas is immune to division. He said: "We are a Palestinian faction, but to apply factional divisions to us is out of the question. Abu-'Ammar ['Arafat] tried the various skills he used on others but failed with us. I do not believe that his movement is as immune to division as Hamas." He added that he has been hearing about a split "for years, but it never occurred." He denied that it is coming under pressure from any party. He asked: "Where are the parties which back us and support the agreement? What form of aid do they give us? What pressures would they put on the Movement if it continued to oppose the agreement?" He emphasized that the Hamas leadership makes the political decisions "and it knows that its decisions stem from its own institutions, and nobody has the means to put pressure on us." He affirmed that no one in Hamas supported the Gaza-Jericho agreement "whether inside or outside [the territories]." On his meeting with [Syrian] Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam and Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' two days ago, Abu-Marzuq said that the two meetings were held "in the course of the Movement's political moves to hold consultations, explain its positions, and discuss a better future for our region." He added that the two meetings "strengthened steadfastness against the designs aimed at splitting the positions which reflect the nation's hopes and aspirations."
