The outgoing prime minister tendered in his resignation and that of his government on 21 March. The head of state accepted the resignation and asked the prime minister to continue conducting the daily affairs of state, which he has been doing to date, to ensure continuity. 2. Like every Togolese, the prime minister deplored and continues to deplore the difficulties the parliamentary majority parties are encountering in agreeing on the appointment of a new prime minister because this state of affairs is thwarting the establishment of the new institutions that are much desired by all. 3. It is proper to recall here the position of the government which refrained from interfering in the electoral disputes, in its concern for the absolute respect for the Electoral Law. In fact, Article 189 of the Electoral Law stipulates the following: Should the Supreme Court notice serious irregularities in the elections that might taint their sincerity and affect the global results, the court can annul the elections. The government would then fix the date for new elections which would take place within a month, at the latest, after the date on which the Supreme Court announces its decision. Clearly Togolese should know that it is not the government that annuls elections. However, the government is bound, in all circumstances, to respect the Electoral Law by fixing a date for the new elections. 4. Consequently, Prime Minister Joseph Koffigoh wants to inform the concerned political leaders that as soon as they find a prime minister, he is ready at all times to hand over the baton of office to him. 5. After all the sacrifices made with the people, Prime Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh reaffirms his faith in democracy in Togo. He, however, refuses to play the role of a scapegoat. Prime Minister Koffigoh also appeals to the parliamentary majority party leaders to reach an agreement and to announce the outcome of their consultations in the superior interest of the Togolese people who have suffered far too much from demagogy and partisan squabbles.
