The Vietnamese Paper NHAN DAN said although the United States threatens "economic sanctions" against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, none of the Asian countries want in actuality to see "sanctions" taken against this country as demanded by the United States. The Nepalese Paper NEPAL NEWS noted that South Korea takes an anti-national, bellicose confrontation attitude, entreating the United States to set up an "international cooperation system" against North Korea. As a matter of fact, South Korea has no justification or qualification to meddle in the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, added the paper. The Zairean Paper UMOJA said: The United States does not know of its dialogue partner. The Korean people and People's Army are not those who would yield to anyone's pressure. They are fully prepared for any event. The United States can get nothing from "sanctions" and pressure. The Jordanian Paper AL SHAAB in a commentary said that North Korea, which has a staunch and self-sacrificing spirit to defend the sovereignty and other legitimate rights with a means of self- defence, can turn into a volcano destroying the "new world order" of the U.S. The Tanzanian Paper WATU said: The DPRK has turned into a powerful socialist state, independent, self-sustaining and self-reliant in national defence. So no "international sanctions" can work on this country. The Swedish Magazine RIKTPUNKT said the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula can be settled only through DPRK-U.S. talks because the issue arose when the United States deployed nuclear weapons in South Korea and began threatening the DPRK with them.
