"Terrorists are criminals. They must be treated like criminals," Johannes Gerster, deputy chairman of the CDU/Christian Social Union Bundestag group, told DIE WELT. "Anyone who commits murder and acts of terrorism cannot expect special treatment." The justice minister had repeated the position, which is often voiced by the FDP, at the inauguration of Chief Federal Prosecutor Nehm. Gerster countered that in particular the head of the Justice Ministry should "not" turn the treatment of criminals "into a media spectacle." The state is in danger of making itself an "ally" of violent criminals. In dealing with terrorists, too, law and order, which keep the door back into society open for everyone, must be the state's maxims for action. Since the RAF has affirmed that it intends to continue its fight against society, all means of law and order must be used against it also in the future, Gerster said.
