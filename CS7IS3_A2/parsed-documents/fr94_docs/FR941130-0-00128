SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The ANPRM In conjunction with the Rose Bowl football game that was played in Pasadena, California on January 1, 1994, a large number of fans of the University of Wisconsin (one of the two teams participating in the game) purchased package tours to California. Many of those tours were promoted as including a ticket to the Rose Bowl game. However, a significant number of these individuals either did not receive the game tickets that they had been promised and did not gain admission to the game, or were required to make an additional payment after they arrived in Pasadena in order to obtain their tickets. On January 27, 1994, the Department issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in this proceeding (published February 1, 1994; 59 FR 4614). In this notice, we stated that we were tentatively proposing to issue a new rule which would contain the procedures of the Department's rules on Super Bowl tours and extend these rules to include air tours to other types of special events where admission to the event is advertised as being included in the package. The Department's rules on Super Bowl tours are contained in Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 380 and section 399.87. These rules came about following problems with game tickets for Super Bowl tours in the late 1970's (see 45 FR 1856, January 9, 1980). The rules were limited to the Super Bowl because that was the only event where such problems had surfaced. Part 380 contains the rules for Super Bowl tours on Public Charter flights: •Section 380.2 defines a Super Bowl charter as a charter flight that is represented by its charter operator as including tickets to the National Football League's Super Bowl game as part of its ground package. •Section 380.18a states that a Super Bowl charter may not be advertised unless the operator has submitted verification to the Department 1 that the operator (1) is in physical possession of enough Super Bowl game tickets to provide them for a substantial number of seats on the charter, or (2) has a contract with the NFL or with an NFL team for such a number of game tickets, or (3) has a contract with another person who has a contract with the NFL or an NFL team for such a number of game tickets. 1 References to ``the Board'' in Part 380 refer to the Civil Aeronautics Board, the Department's predecessor in aviation economic and consumer matters. The Department of Transportation now administers this rule as authorized by the Civil Aeronautics Board Sunset Act of 1984 (P.L. 98&hyph;443; 98 Stat. 1703). •Section 380.18a also states that a Super Bowl charter may not be sold unless the operator has submitted verification to the Department that the operator has possession of, or contracts for, enough game tickets to provide one to every person who is to receive one under the terms of the operator/participant contract for the charter.
