Liu Qi's admonition contains this message: China should not be merely content with its status as an iron and steel power but should redouble its efforts to narrow the gap with advanced world levels in iron and steel production, and become a strong iron and steel power. This message is justified by the fact that China's backward iron and steel production structure has caused a substantial gap between its iron and steel industry, and that of the world in terms of quality, variety, consumption, cost, and labor productivity. Statistics show that only 25 percent of technology and equipment used by China's iron and steel industry is relatively advanced, and 30 to 40 varieties of its steel products cannot satisfy demand. The energy consumption levels of key iron and steel enterprises are 40 percent more than advanced international levels. Only 83 percent of steel is turned into finished products, 10 percent less than in Japan. In terms of continuous casting ratios, China is the fourth lowest among the world's 17 countries which produce 10 million tonnes of steel each. And its real labor productivity is far below advanced international levels. Over the past few years, the poor structure of the iron and steel industry was masked by quantitative shortages because of the substantial imbalance between supply and demand in our country's iron and steel products. Rapid growth in steel output has now effectively relieved the pressure of demand, thus facilitating efforts by the iron and steel industry to optimize its technological and economic structure. Some metallurgists in China pointed out: China's iron and steel industry has entered a transition period in which it is shifting from emphasizing "tonnage growth" to "optimizing its structure." If China wants to become a steel power capable of producing more than 100 million tonnes of steel, it cannot merely increase tonnage on the basis of its current structure but should seek increases on the basis of an optimized structure. Because the iron and steel industry is an important raw and semifinished materials sector, its structural optimization is by no means its own internal affair; this is a demand stemming from national economic restructuring regarding the development of the iron and steel industry. For a long time to come, our country will need large quantities of various high-quality steel products if it wants to greatly expand the railway, transportation, energy, communications, automobile, and electronic sectors. For this reason, Metallurgy Industry Minister Liu Qi urged the iron and steel industry to perform the following tasks to optimize its structure: Speeding up the development of continuous casting technology to promote the optimization of steel smelting and steel rolling technology; focusing on upgrading the technical levels of a number of old enterprises and special steel enterprises; devoting major efforts to applying various new techniques and technologies; and going all out to develop domestic mines. Liu Qi also pointed out emphatically: In optimizing the iron and steel industrial structure, we must change our concepts instead of merely increasing output and expanding the production scale to improve efficiency. The key to improving efficiency lies in increasing the technological contents of all production stages, in optimizing technological lines, and in manufacturing competitive products. We should take structural optimization as a major task which determines the iron and steel industry's long-term success or failure. Iron and steel industry people in foreign countries now recognize that quantity and scale are no longer the sole hallmark of a country's iron and steel industrial strength. To emerge as a strong iron and steel power in the world, China's iron and steel industry must devote great efforts to optimizing its structure, and change its status as an iron and steel power with high output in favor of a strong iron and steel power with high productive capacity and productivity.
