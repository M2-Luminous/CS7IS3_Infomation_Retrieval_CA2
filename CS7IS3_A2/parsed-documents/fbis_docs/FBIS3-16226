In his turn, V. Birkavs stressed that Latvia is going through a difficult, transitional period in its development now. It is made even more complicated by difficulties in its relations with Russia. Nevertheless, the head of the Latvian Government said, the people of the Latvian Republic believe in the prospects for democratic development in the country and hope for the support of other nations. Latvia has firmly declared its intent to gradually become a member of the European Union and to join international security structures. In this connection, the prime minister of Latvia asked the Netherlands for support. Today, the sides signed two agreements -- on avoiding dual taxation and on protecting investments. V. Birkavs expressed the hope that even more important bilateral economic agreements would be drawn up soon.
