FR940110-2-00017 FR940110-2-00011 Department's Position: We agree with Toyota that in the preliminary results we incorrectly calculated ISE incurred in Japan by TAL with respect to U.S. sales. For the final results, we have applied the ISE factor to the reported transfer price between TAL and TMS instead of to TMS' reported selling price in the United States. We have made a corresponding adjustment for TAL's ISE incurred on HM sales. Comment 8: Toyota contends that the Department erred in calculating an offset to value-added expenses for income and profit earned from other business ventures. Toyota explains that the Department reduced general and administrative (G&A) expenses associated with value-added activity by an amount for net income and profit from other business ventures that greatly exceeded that reported in its questionnaire response. Toyota requests that the Department revise its income ``offset'' calculation for the final results to reflect the information contained in its questionnaire response. Department's Position: We agree with Toyota. For the final results, we have revised the offset calculation to reflect accurately the amounts reported for net income and profit from other business ventures in Toyota's questionnaire response. Comment 9: Toyota claims that the Department incorrectly calculated U.S. credit expenses by using an intra-company interest rate and not a rate based on its actual cost of borrowing from unrelated sources. Specifically, in calculating credit expenses, the Department used the interest rate paid by TMS to Toyota Motor Credit Corporation (TMCC), its related finance company. As a result, Toyota argues that the Department created a fictional ``expense'' that is based on an internal transaction between TMS and TMCC which is irrelevant to the dumping analysis. Toyota urges the Department to use the interest rate paid by TMCC on its short-term borrowings to calculate credit expenses for sales by TMS because the rate paid by TMCC reflects Toyota's actual cost of financing from unrelated sources. Petitioners disagree, arguing that the interest rate paid to outside sources by TMCC does not account for the total cost actually incurred by TMCC to extend credit to TMS. Petitioners note that TMCC incurs expenses to obtain funds to finance its operations as well as numerous operating expenses. It would, therefore, be inappropriate to base credit expenses for TMS simply on the short-term interest rate paid by TMCC to outside sources without accounting for the additional expenses incurred by TMCC to extend credit on sales made by TMS. Department's Position: We disagree with Toyota. For the final results, we calculated U.S. credit expenses based on the experience of the sales division of Toyota. Because TMS is the selling division in the United States, not TMCC, we determined that the interest rate that should be used in the calculation of credit expense is one based on TMS' experience. Because TMS does not have any short-term loans from unrelated sources, we have used the interest rate that TMCC charged TMS to reflect the credit expenses incurred on U.S. sales. This approach is consistent with the credit expense methodology used in the previous administrative review. Comment 10: Petitioners claim that Toyota did not report certain direct magazine advertising expenses incurred on U.S. sales. Petitioners state that these expenses consist of advertisements in national industry publications that were directed at end-user customers of Toyota's U.S. forklift dealers, and refer to the Toyota Industrial Equipment Division (TIE) of Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. Petitioners propose recalculating Toyota's direct U.S. selling expenses to include these advertising expenses. Petitioners suggest that the Department divide Toyota's reported cost for magazine advertisements during the period of review (POR) by the number of forklifts sold in the U.S. over the POR, and add this amount to U.S. direct selling expenses for each forklift. Toyota acknowledges that these magazine advertising expenses were classified as direct expenses by the Department in the first review. See Forklifts I. However, respondent claims that petitioners' proposed recalculation of these expenses is incorrect. Toyota notes that these expenses are specifically identified in its questionnaire response and, therefore, should be separated out from reported ISE and reclassified as direct selling expenses. Department's Position: We agree with both petitioners and Toyota that these magazine advertising expenses should be properly classified as direct selling expenses. However, we disagree with petitioners' contention that Toyota failed to report such expenses. Toyota did report these expenses under ISE in its questionnaire response. Thus, for these final results, we deducted the amount of magazine advertising expenses identified by Toyota from reported ISE and reclassified such expenses as direct selling expenses. Comment 11: Petitioners claim that Toyota did not report the cost incurred to retrofit its forklifts with redesigned seats under its operator restraint safety seat (``ORS'') program. In support of this contention, petitioners have submitted a Toyota advertisement, which petitioners claim offers free installation of new winged safety seats and seat belts to end-users of subject merchandise. Petitioners argue that all costs incurred under this program, including the cost of all advertisements, the cost of the new seats, and the costs incurred to install the seats, should be considered direct U.S. selling expenses. Petitioners assert that absent submission of proper information by Toyota, the Department should use the total ORS costs reported by Toyota for the first administrative review and allocate those costs to sales during this review. Toyota maintains that the retrofit expenses referred to by petitioners were incurred solely for forklift trucks imported and sold prior to the first period of review. Toyota notes that petitioners' argument erroneously implies that the Department included retrofit expenses in its margin analysis for the first review. Respondent states that the Department's first review verification report confirms that all trucks imported and sold during the first administrative review period were manufactured with an ORS, thereby obviating the necessity of retrofittings. Department's Position: We agree with Toyota. Because there is no evidence on the record indicating that forklifts sold during the POR required retrofitting, we determine that no adjustment is required. The advertisement submitted by petitioners makes no reference to products sold during the POR. Petitioners have thus provided no evidence that Toyota incurred any such expenses with respect to the Toyota sales made in the current POR.
