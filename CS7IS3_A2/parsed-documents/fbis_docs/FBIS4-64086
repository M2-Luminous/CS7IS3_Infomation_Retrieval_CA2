Gerashchenko told BUSINESS-TASS that those documents had actually been prepared by specialists from the Central Bank, along with other departments. They were then only polished up by the president's staff. "The aim of the published decrees is to raise contract discipline and achieve the honoring of responsibilities before each other and before the state", the chairman noted, adding that the decrees would be fully implemented by the Central Bank. The only thing that might have given rise to the rumours of his opposition, said Gerashchenko, was his comment, made at a recent meeting of the government, that the system of final editing of decrees and documents could be improved. He said the government should avoid changing documents which have already been fully prepared, since that might lead to some misunderstandings.
