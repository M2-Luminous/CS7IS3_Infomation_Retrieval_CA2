Kasoulidhis said Denktas' claims, that he has given a positive answer on all points raised by the United Nations, are strictly his own personal evaluation. He said: Things will clear up after the UN Security Council's additional briefing by UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. The spokesman added that if any change to the 21 March UN document would benefit either side, it would make the compromise unfair and unbalanced. He said: The March proposals constitute a compromise that the United Nations has described as fair and balanced. The spokesman was replying to a statement by U.S. State Department Spokesman Michael McCurry, that the current pursuit is to combine the Greek Cypriot views, which have accepted the March proposals, and the Turkish Cypriot views, which have accepted a variation. Kasoulidhis noted that the March proposals do not conform to the positions of the Greek Cypriot side so there is no issue of merging with those issues that the Turkish Cypriot side have accepted in June.
