There have been reports of late that joint operations could be undertaken in Iran and Iraq and that signs in this direction are being observed. Was this a qualitative jump? [Demirel] There is some information to the effect that the PKK [Kurdish Workers Party] has settled in Iran. These were rumors for a while and Iran rejected them. Later, the situation was explained to Iran. Incidents that might have happened over there would have concerned them. Upon that, a major rapprochement took place. I held a long conversation with Hashemi-Rafsanjani in Tehran last year. I also held a long conversation with him when he visited Istanbul for the ECO [Economic Cooperation Organization] meeting. Our foreign minister went to Iran and their's came here. All these things are good, but there is also an agreement that goes back to 1932. If they [the PKK] are there, let us launch an operation against them. We have reached the point of joint operation. [Yalcin] Is this, that is, the joint operation, something for the coming months? [Demirel] But an improvement is obvious. [reply as published] [Yalcin] What about the last three visits? [Demirel] These were scheduled visits. Their foreign minister could come at any time. First Vice President Habibi had to pay a return visit for my visit, but it was then postponed following the assassination of Ugur Mumcu. It was said that the Iranians were behind it, which upset them. [Yalcin] I will ask a question concerning the PKK. For the last 10 years there have been promises to the effect that this problem would be eradicated. You too expressed similar views. Has there been a tragic turn to the events now? [passage omitted] [Demirel] No matter which government comes to power it has to show the same determination that the 49th government headed by me and the present 50th government have shown. Any other government cannot be the government of this state. [Yalcin] New forces and measures are being introduced. Are these the foundation of this determination? [Demirel] These are security measures. There is no political aspect to it. [Yalcin] You made a statement on local elections. Could you clarify it? You said that the PKK candidates will be prevented from running. What is the legal way to prevent it? That is, how are you going to do that? [Demirel] Could a PKK candidate run in an election? [Yalcin] How are you going to weed out such people since their being PKK is not written on them? [Demirel] What I want to say is this: If a PKK member runs in these elections and wins it would be tantamount to a plebiscite. The PKK is a criminal organization, a terrorist group. Could a state, while struggling against the criminal and terrorist group, also allow its members to run in the elections? When the time comes, measures against it will be thought out. [Yalcin] Is there a legal measure before the start of the elections? [Demirel] No, there is no legal way to sift out such people before the elections. But if a candidate says "I am a PKK member," or is engaged in such propaganda, then the state will take care of it. Could a state ever allow members of a crime syndicate to run in elections? Could the state forces, which pursue the bandits in the mountains, allow the members of that bandit group to come down to the cities and run in elections? [Yalcin] There might be legal measures if the state knows these people. [Demirel] It knows, it knows. The state knows everything. Of course there is also the following case: The elections cannot be presented as a plebiscite if a candidate has not entered the elections in the name of the PKK and has not openly declared himself affiliated to it but later announces that he is a PKK member. [Yalcin] Simply because he has not stated this at the beginning? [Demirel] This is not possible by merely stating that elections were tantamount to a plebiscite. [passage omitted] [Yalcin] When we were still publishing the magazine 2000 IKIBIN'E DOGRU, I asked you. I then conveyed to you fresh reports, and at the time you told me that such organizations are illegal and that you are opposed to such things. You are now the head of state and an influential organization is active over there. I am talking about Hizballah, which is based in the east and southeast. What can you say on this issue? [Demirel] The state is closely watching this organization. The state cannot make concessions to illegal activities. There cannot be a state where some enjoy the right to commit lawless acts and some are charged with criminal offenses if they act lawlessly. We are watching them very closely. [Yalcin] You might have heard, but it is being said that the state is making use of Hizballah to balance out the PKK. [Demirel] Such a claim is wrong. [Yalcin] But there have been many complaints in this direction in Batman. [Demirel] There is no such case. [Yalcin] There are hundreds of unsolved murders in Batman. [Demirel] Unfortunately, all these are interconnected. I am following the case of unsolved crimes very closely. [Yalcin] Are you satisfied with the things that are being done to solve these problems? You are at the helm of the state and yet such things are taking place in the country you run. [Demirel] It would be very wrong if I were to say that I am not concerned about what is happening in Turkey. I am very concerned. But since the state has no other alternative than its present course of action, then it should do what it is already doing but do it better and get results. I am telling you openly that in my former capacity as prime minister and in my present capacity as the head of the National Security Council I told all the state organs that the unsolved crimes should be solved. Otherwise, there will be an inclination to blame them on the state. I am following this problem very closely. It is being tackled in a positive manner.
