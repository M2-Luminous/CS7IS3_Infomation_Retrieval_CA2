The picture of the illness is clear, for the symptoms have appeared repeatedly during the year since Berov's cabinet assumed office. The crisis erupted this week. Bulgaria does not have a budget. Only a few days after the National Budget Bill was adopted, the national currency was devalued almost 25 percent. Increasing the basic interest rate will help to block the economy completely. In a few days time we will know whether Bulgaria will receive a stand-by credit. Experts are convinced that, against the background of the crisis, there is little chance of reaching an agreement with the international finance institutions. Apparently, our state currency reserves are back at the level of 8 November 1991. In April the price of electricity and heating will increase. The Khan Kubrat vessel reaches Serbia with a full cargo, and returns empty.... At the moment no one in Bulgaria is responsible for all this. [Deputy Prime Ministers] Matinchev and Karabashev quarrel publicly. Lukanov says that the government is wonderful, and forgets about the promised cabinet changes. At their plenum the Socialists declare that they are relying on Berov. They are relying on a sick man who has undergone surgery to strengthen a state that is currently under the scalpel of an economic and political crisis. Ludzhev, Tomov, and the rest seek escape in the memories of 1990-91. Everyone tries to escape the present. According to Article 108 of the Constitution the prime minister alone is responsible for the actions of the government. Each of the ministers is responsible for his own actions and not for the cabinet as a whole. A long time ago the Union of Democratic forces called the Berov cabinet the government of irresponsibility. Today this definition applies to the entire state. The head of state observes the political crisis from Paris, from above, or from the sidelines. In a normal state with such an abnormal situation the president would be holding urgent talks with the political forces. If Bulgaria wants to be a democratic state, then urgent institutional measures to solve the situation must be adopted. Appeals to the people and Sunday radio interviews are hardly a serious means of saving a state that is lying on the operating table. President Zhelev should look the crisis in the eye.
