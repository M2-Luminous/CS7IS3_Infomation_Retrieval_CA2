He is in the Netherlands for two days for political talks and a for a special television program on the upcoming elections in April. Despite the huge domestic problems, Nelson Mandela is optimistic about the forthcoming first-ever democratic elections. He does not rule out that the Inkatha movement also will participate, despite Inkatha leader Buthelezi's statements that ANC concessions for greater regional autonomy are not sufficient. [Begin recording] [Boonman] Nelson Mandela arrived at the Hilversum television studio tonight for the taping of a special program. He does not want to discuss the difficult negotiations with the right-wing whites and the Zulu movement Inkatha. [Unidentified reporter in English with Dutch subtitles] How important is a fund-raising evening for the ANC in the Netherlands? [Mandela] Well, our visits to the Netherlands have always been crowned with success. [Boonman] During the special program, money will be collected for election projects in South Africa. [end recording] [Dijkstra] Mandela started his visit to the Netherlands with a luncheon at the Catshuis [prime minister's residence]. He spoke among others with Prime Minister Lubbers and Vice Prime Minister Kok. Yesterday in Johannesburg, the ANC leader made promises to the right-wing white organizations and to the Inkatha movement. He promised them a greater say in the future South Africa. Inkatha has rejected the offer, but Mandela remains optimistic. [Begin recording] [Mandela] As far as my understanding of his [Buthelezi] comments, it does appear that he has left the door open if ANC clarifies the offers it has made. I therefore believe that it is premature for us to decide that he has rejected the offer. [Boonman] Mandela does not rule greater autonomy in order to draw all parties to the elections. [Mandela] In a case where you are trying to build a new country, there can be no final concession. Concessions are inherent in negotiations. [Boonman] The Netherlands Government has assured Mr. Mandela that it would also assist the new South Africa with money. In an interview with Lubbers and Mandela to be broadcast later tonight on Nederland-3, Lubbers agrees to pay this price. [Lubbers in English with Dutch subtitles] I would not exclude the possibility of supporting Mr. Mandela as a symbol, not only because of the elections, but also as a symbol to say: Let us set out a new course for the future. [Boonman] Before he leaves tomorrow, Mr. Mandela will meet with Netherlands businessmen to persuade them to invest in South Africa. [end recording] [Dijkstra] Tomorrow morning Nelson Mandela will also meet Yasir 'Arafat. The PLO leader arrives late today and will be received tomorrow by Prime Minister Lubbers.
