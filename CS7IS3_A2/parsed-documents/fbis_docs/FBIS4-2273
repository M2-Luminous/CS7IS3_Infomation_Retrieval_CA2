Liu Fuan, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, attended the session. On behalf of the standing committee of the provincial discipline inspection committee, Lang Dazhong, provincial party committee standing committee member and secretary of the provincial discipline inspection commission, delivered a report to the session. He said: Since the third session of the provincial party committee, under the leadership of the provincial party committee and government, discipline inspection and procuratorial departments throughout the province have paid intense attention to the honesty and self-discipline in performing duties of cadres at the office level and above and investigated and handled major and important cases. In the last two years, provincial discipline inspection organizations have investigated and handled 5,951 cases of discipline violations, punishing 4,982 party members for discipline violations, of whom 96 were party-member cadres at the county and office levels; provincial administrative inspection organizations have placed 967 cases on file for investigation and prosecution and meted out disciplinary sanctions to 897 persons, of whom 12 were cadres at the county and office levels, and they have also specifically handled key problems and rectified key departments. The provincial authorities have scrapped 2,451 fee-collection items, lightening the burden on enterprises and the people by a total of 380 million yuan a year. Thanks to unremitting efforts, the province has achieved some results in anticorruption work; outstanding corrupt practices have disappeared to some extent; and party-member cadres have received a profound reeducation on resisting corruption and degeneration and on honesty in government, enhanced their sense of incorruptibility and self-discipline, worked out regulations on incorruptibility and self-discipline, and formed a restraining mechanism, thus laying a foundation for the further improvement of party style and the construction of clean government. Overall, the momentum of the province's anticorruption struggle is good and it is now progressing healthily. This has helped to promote and ensure the province's reform and opening up to the outside world, and also economic construction, thus laying a good foundation for deepening the struggle against corruption. Lang Dazhong said: This year, discipline inspection departments should earnestly study and implement Comrade Jiang Zemin's important speech and the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission; effectively carry out the anticorruption struggle by proceeding from the overall situation of reform, development, and stability; devote efforts to consolidation, policy implementation, and persistence; and deepen the struggle, step by step, with the emphasis on practical results. It is still necessary to continue to pay close attention to the three tasks. Leading cadres should continue to take the lead in honestly performing their official duties and exercising self-discipline. Cadres at the county and office levels of party and government leading organizations, judicial organs, administrative law- enforcement departments, and economic management departments should have finished conducting inner-party democratic activities by the end of May. It is necessary to continue to regard the investigation and handling of cases as the focal point of the anticorruption struggle, concentrate forces on investigating and handling major and important cases, check unhealthy practices, and devote efforts toward policy implementation. In conclusion, Lang Dazhong said: The key to doing a good job of this year's anticorruption work lies in improved leadership. Principal leaders of party committees and governments at all levels should assume overall responsibility for the anticorruption work in the localities and departments under their own jurisdiction, so that the work will be continuously carried out in depth, level after level down, with specific persons taking charge and making fresh contributions to promoting the province's economic development, pushing ahead with its reform and opening up to the outside world, and safeguarding its political stability.
