(i) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty imposed by the Administrator as provided in this part after the order making the assessment has become final or after a court in an action brought under paragraph (c)(5) of this section has entered a final judgment in favor of the Administrator, the Administrator shall request that the Attorney General bring a civil action in an appropriate district court to recover the amount assessed (plus interest at rates established pursuant to section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 from the date of the final order or the date of final judgment, as the case may be). In such an action, the validity, amount, and appropriateness of the penalty is not subject to review. (ii) A person who fails to pay on a timely basis the amount of an assessment of a civil penalty as described in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section shall be required to pay, in addition to that amount and interest, the United States' enforcement expenses, including attorney's fees and costs for collection proceedings, and a quarterly nonpayment penalty for each quarter during which the failure to pay persists. The nonpayment penalty is an amount equal to ten percent of the aggregate amount of that person's penalties and nonpayment penalties which are unpaid as of the beginning of such quarter. §89.1007 Warranty provisions. (a) The manufacturer of each nonroad engine must warrant to the ultimate purchaser and each subsequent purchaser that the engine is designed, built, and equipped so as to conform at the time of sale with applicable regulations under section 213 of the Act, and is free from defects in materials and workmanship which cause such engine to fail to conform with applicable regulations for its warranty period (as determined under §89.104&hyph;96). (b) In the case of a nonroad engine part, the manufacturer or rebuilder of the part may certify according to §85.2112 that use of the part will not result in a failure of the engine to comply with emission standards promulgated in this part. (c) For the purposes of this section, the owner of any nonroad engine warranted under this part is responsible for the proper maintenance of the engine. Proper maintenance includes replacement and service, at the owner's expense at a service establishment or facility of the owner's choosing, such items as spark plugs, points, condensers, and any other part, item, or device related to emission control (but not designed for emission control) under the terms of the last sentence of section 207(a)(3) of the Act, unless such part, item, or device is covered by any warranty not mandated by this Act. §89.1008 In-use compliance provisions. (a) Effective with respect to nonroad vehicles, equipment, and engines manufactured during model years 1996 and after: (1) If the Administrator determines that a substantial number of any class or category of engines, although properly maintained and used, do not conform to the regulations prescribed under section 213 of the Act when in actual use throughout their recall period (as defined under §89.104&hyph;96(b)), the Administrator shall immediately notify the manufacturer of such nonconformity and require the manufacturer to submit a plan for remedying the nonconformity of the engines with respect to which such notification is given. (i) The manufacturer's plan shall provide that the nonconformity of any such engines which are properly used and maintained will be remedied at the expense of the manufacturer. (ii) If the manufacturer disagrees with such determination of nonconformity and so advises the Administrator, the Administrator shall afford the manufacturer and other interested persons an opportunity to present their views and evidence in support thereof at a public hearing. Unless, as a result of such hearing, the Administrator withdraws such determination of nonconformity, the Administrator shall, within 60 days after the completion of such hearing, order the manufacturer to provide prompt notification of such nonconformity in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The manufacturer shall comply in all respects with the requirements of subpart G of this part. (2) Any notification required to be given by the manufacturer under paragraph (a)(1) of this section with respect to any class or category of engines shall be given to dealers, ultimate purchasers, and subsequent purchasers (if known) in such manner and containing such information as required in subparts H and I of this part. (3)(i) The manufacturer shall furnish with each new nonroad engine written instructions for the proper maintenance and use of the engine by the ultimate purchaser as required under §89.109&hyph;96. The manufacturer shall provide in boldface type on the first page of the written maintenance instructions notice that maintenance, replacement, or repair of the emission control devices and systems may be performed by any nonroad engine repair establishment or individual using any nonroad engine part which has been certified as provided in §89.1007(a).
