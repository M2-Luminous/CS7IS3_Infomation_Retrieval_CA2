The man who has the rank of vice premier in Beijing had access to all hierarchical levels of French diplomatic decisionmaking: The Elysee [presidential residence] and then the Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry] the day before yesterday, and the Hotel Matignon [prime minister's office] this morning. In addition, to complete the success of his visit, Mr. Qian Qichen will give a luncheon at his embassy in avenue George-V for U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, himself on an official visit to Paris. Saturday's talks were "constructive and positive, in a very warm atmosphere," according to the Chinese delegation spokesman. In diplomatic language, when the expression "frank exchange of views" is not used it means that no unpleasant subject was raised. The Tibet, Hong Kong, and Taiwan questions were not raised. With regard to respect for human rights in China, the French leaders showed much greater discretion than they had four or five years ago, the time when the republic invited the students who had escaped from the Tienanmen Square massacre and the ensuing police repression to hold a march on the Champs-Elysees. [French Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe, for whom "France does not use double-talk," nonetheless expressed the hope that China's economic progress will be accompanied by progress in the sphere of human rights. [passage omitted] During a wide-ranging "review" of major international issues, Mr. Juppe and Mr. Qian Qichen discussed the situation in Bosnia at length. The Chinese minister must not have been particularly embarrassed, because Beijing, despite its seat as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, has always carefully kept out of the numerous abortive Western attempts to end the Serbian aggression against Sarajevo. The former Yugoslavia is a very long way from China for which the best policy in the Balkans is still abstention. Nonetheless, the French minister expressed the hope that the big powers will be more committed to supporting the Twelve's plan for Bosnia -- which is consistent with the Owen-Stoltenberg UN plan for a partition of the young republic into three ethnically homogeneous areas. The UN Security Council is a real possible sphere of agreement for Chinese and French foreign policy. According to a French official, the two ministers "agreed that a reform of the Council was necessary to take account of the changes which have taken place in the world since 1945, but that, at the same time, it was necessary to maintain the current status of the permanent members." Indeed, without daring to say it openly, France and China are opposed to the expansion of the Council to new permanent members. Beijing has no desire to see Tokyo -- its hereditary enemy and rival -- gaining political influence equivalent to its own. Paris (like London) has always given a cool reception to the idea of giving up its right of veto to a Europe whose political efficacy still has to be demonstrated. It is therefore probably in New York that the first fruits of the Franco-Chinese "normalization" will be produced.
