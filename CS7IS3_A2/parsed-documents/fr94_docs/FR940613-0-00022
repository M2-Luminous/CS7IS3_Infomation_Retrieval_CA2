FR940613-0-00022 FR940613-0-00008 Even though, based on the discussion set forth above, Customs believes the amendments in this document may be promulgated on an interim basis and could be effective immediately, Customs is providing a 45-day delayed effective date, with a 30 day comment period preceding that effective date. This represents a practical compromise between the need for temporal urgency and the desirability of public participation in the rulemaking process. In the spirit of the APA, the agency is soliciting public comment regarding its decision to promulgate these interim regulations and in delaying their effective date only for that period of time necessary to review any relevant comments regarding that decision. Unless the comments show that there exists good cause for not making the regulations effective on an interim basis, the regulations will become effective on an interim basis on the 45th day following the date of publication. Comments Consequently, the agency hereby solicits comments on both the substance of these regulations and their intended effective date. The comments should clearly state whether they address the substance of the interim rule or the agency's determination to make the rule effective on an interim basis. If, based on the comments, good cause is shown that the regulations should not become effective on an interim basis, a document will be issued withdrawing the interim regulations before their effective date. If no such good cause is shown, the interim regulations will go into effect. The agency will then be able to gain experience with the interim regulation, fully consider substantive comments, and decide whether the interim regulation needs amendment before its promulgation as a final rule. Consideration will be given to any written comments (preferably in triplicate) that are timely submitted to Customs. All such comments received from the public pursuant to this notice of rulemaking will be available for public inspection in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), §1.4, Treasury Department Regulations (31 CFR 1.4), and §103.11(b), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 103.11(b)), during regular business days between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. at the Regulations Branch, 1099 14th Street, NW., suite 4000, Washington, DC.
