He believes that Kyrgyzstan was in an unfavorable geo-political situation since it had no access to the sea or other "trade communications." Akayev underlined that in the near future the Republic would depend on the neighboring countries, especially on Russia since Kyrgyzstan along with the whole Central Asian region was not in the sphere of interests of the economically developed countries. Akayev suggested that no serious foreign investments were likely to be attracted by the industrial potential of Kyrgyzstan since the Republic was failing to maintain the industrial infrastructure. "Since Kyrgyzstan has no other choice, the government has to suspend activities of many enterprises," Akayev said. Akayev emphasized that foreign investors were not eager to place their money to the Kyrgyz economy since they were lacking political stability in Kyrgyzstan and guarantees. "That is why it is hard to believe that the rating of Kyrgyzstan as a developing country will go up in the near ten or fifteen years," Akayev regretted. He was sure that the economic and social problems experienced by Kyrgyzstan could be overcome only through cooperation with Russia. The main point here is to enhance the economic relations and mutually beneficial industrial cooperation with Russia. However, he had to stress that the trade and economic relations between the two countries were decreasing and coming to a critical point. (INTERFFAX Note: Before 1992 the trade turnover between Kyrgyzstan and Russia was 70 pct of the whole volume of that for Kyrgyzstan. In the first quarter of 1994 it significantly went down. Russia found itself in the third place after Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.) Akayev suggested that a joint Kyrgyz-Russian holding company must be created with the authorized capital of 30 billion or 50 billion Russian rubles. The company would focus on restoration of the bilateral trade and economic and industrial relations. Akayev thought that the company must be accumulating money resources and ensure participation of Russian citizens in privatization in Kyrgyzstan. The company must also be carrying out trust operations with the real estate of the population leaving the Republic and contributing to development of the small and average business by Russian-speaking citizens. The company could also be organizing mass travel tours to Kyrgyzstan by Russian tourists. Akayev regretted that Russia had not as yet responded to his proposals stated in 1993. The Kyrgyz president also pointed out that since industrial relations with Russia were being broken the number of Russians migrating was increasing, especially of Russians working at industrial enterprises. Akayev said that the emigration of Russia-speaking population was a catastrophe not only for Kyrgyzstan but also for Russia since it was difficult to receive hundreds of thousands of Russians coming from Kyrgyzstan. (INTERFAX Note: In 1990 there were about 918,000 Russians in Kyrgyzstan (21.2 pct of the Kyrgyz population). On 1 April 1994, there were about 750,000 Russians living in Kyrgyzstan (17 pct). For the first time in the Soviet and post-Soviet time in Kyrgyzstan the total number of the Kyrgyz population has decreased due to the migration by Russians. Currently, there are about 4.4299 million people living in Kyrgyzstan (the number fixed on 1 January 1994). This is 40,000 people fewer that it was on 1 January 1993.) Akayev pointed out that the departure of Russian specialists was doing a significant harm to the Kyrgyz economy. Kyrgyz experts consider the deteriorating economic situation in Kyrgyzstan as the main reason for migration. Russian experts see social and political reasons as essential, Akayev said. For instance, Russian experts believe that the transition to the Kyrgyz language as the official one was forcing Russians out of many spheres. There were certain cases of discrimination in the sphere of entrepreneurship and of nationalism in everyday life which were not neither encouraged nor condemned by the official authorities. Akayev stressed he would listen to such conclusions by Russian experts. However, Akayev categorically disagreed that Russians in Kyrgyzstan had no future. He said such suggestions had no ground and must not be admitted. Commenting on the problem with the migration, Akayev said that its settlement would also depend on participation of Russia since Kyrgyzstan could not resolve all the problems on its own. Akayev regretted that the proposal to adopt a declaration on the rights of ethnic minorities stated at the recent CIS summit had been put aside. Akayev was certain that all ethnic minorities in Kyrgyzstan must have a quota in the parliament and in the local bodies. He thought that the Russian language must be made the official one in the regions mostly populated by Russians. Akayev spoke in favor of dual citizenship for Russians. The Kyrgyz president suggested that the issue on dual citizenship could be solved following the example of the European Union after the Maastricht treaty. Akayev refuted the allegations that he could not make an independent decision on this issue as a president. He just stressed that in accordance with the Constitution the issues on dual citizenship and state languages must be decided upon by the parliament. Akayev said he could not confront the parliament which mostly was not in favor of adopting such decisions. The president believes that it is necessary to work with the public opinion before these problems be settled. During a meeting with the heads of the local administration on Monday Akayev emphasized his intention to strengthen the state power. He made it clear that the point was not to alter the general policy but to review the former concepts which had proved themselves illusory and inadequate. The new realities make change the guidelines. Akayev stressed that he remain a faithful supporter of democracy. However, he believes that life has shown democratic means as inefficient and hindering implementation of the reforms. There is no alternative to a strong state power in the Republic since the people were not ready for democratic self-rule, Akayev said. The Kyrgyz president stated that he would remove everybody who would hamper implementation of state decisions and the program of the structural reorganization of the economy planned for the next three years. Akayev said many people wanted a tough authoritarian regime to be established in the Republic similar to that in other CIS states. However, in his opinion, this would bring no results. Akayev suggested that the parliamentarianism in Kyrgyzstan had made the Supreme Soviet get involved with political and criminal investigations rather than perform its legislative functions. The parliament had become a substitute for the state committee on security, the Interior Ministry and the courts which was frightening potential investors. "Many people in Kyrgyzstan have regarded the parliament as an apotheoses of democracy. However, the activities of the present parliament are braking the reforms and create such a reputation to Kyrgyzstan, which makes it look as a scandalous country," Akayev said.
