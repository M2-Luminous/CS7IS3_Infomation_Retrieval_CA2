The Japanese Government has been taking a moderate attitude toward North Korea, calling for a UNSC warning before imposing any sanctions. However, some quarters in the government are calling for stronger actions to cope with North Korea's high-handed attitude. The government has reportedly started consulting the United States and the ROK to jointly urge the UNSC to adopt immediate sanctions. On the same day, a top Foreign Ministry official hinted at a change in Japan's stance toward UNSC resolutions, saying: "Japan has been calling for step-by-step sanctions beginning with a warning by the UNSC, but this does not mean Japan wants to disturb the efforts of the international community." In addition, a Foreign Ministry source said stronger sanctions are likely to be imposed: "The UNSC may include Japan's ban on remittances to North Korea from the first stage." In that case, the government will face a difficult situation since the remittance ban is expected to arouse much controversy in Japan. To cope with the North Korean nuclear issue, Japan, the United States, and the ROK held working-level talks in Washington on 4 June. Moreover, U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Peter Tarnoff visited Japan and the ROK from 10 to 11 June to finalize a motion to be submitted to the UNSC. The Japanese Government has been insisting that UNSC sanctions be implemented moderately on a step-by-step basis, since impatient measures would obtain support from neither China nor the Japanese public. In line with the moderate policy, Japan requested the UNSC issue a warning against North Korea prior to imposing sanctions. The United States and the ROK initially showed consideration for Japan's position, and agreed to jointly seek step-by-step sanctions. Yet the two nations then showed slightly different positions, calling for a UNSC decision on suspension of technological aid and cultural exchanges by the United Nations, rather than bans on remittances or oil exports. Following North Korea's announcement of its immediate withdrawal from the IAEA, the United States and the ROK have assumed a firm attitude. In a phone call with Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa on the morning of 14 June, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher hinted at a U.S. policy to strengthen the UNSC resolution, saying: "We may have to reconsider our proposal to the UNSC."
