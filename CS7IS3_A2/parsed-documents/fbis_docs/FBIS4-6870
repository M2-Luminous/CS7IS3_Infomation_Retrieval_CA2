In this regard, Shigeru Hatakeyama, administrative vice minister of the Defense Agency [DA], said at a news conference on 20 April that "The emergency defense legislation that Mr. Ozawa is talking about is different from the general emergency legislation that we studied before in terms of its characteristics and range of influence." He explained his opinion that Ozawa's "emergency defense legislation" is not general legislation but rather a concept designed to deal with the DPRK's suspected nuclear weapons development program. Hatakeyama first said that "the general emergency legislation deals with various peacetime regulations regarding movements of the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] during emergencies." He then explained his view, saying, "I think that lawmakers, when they talk about the emergency defense legislation, must keep in mind the cooperation that Japan can give to the international community, as well as the support that Japan can provide to the U.S. military, when the UN Security Council adopts a resolution to deal with an emergency situation on the Korean peninsula." As for "collective security," Hatakeyama said that "the DA does not have a particular definition concerning actions for collective security." However, on the question of whether the SDF can cooperate with the international community in the area of logistics to deal with an emergency on the Korean peninsula within the scope of the current laws, Hatakeyama explained his understanding that "there are many things we cannot do unless we give power to the SDF by revising the current laws or by introducing new laws."
