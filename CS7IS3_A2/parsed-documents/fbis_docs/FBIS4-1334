Then follows a voice reading the following: "The great thing about a multiparty democracy is that one party cannot just do whatever it likes, because the others keep an eye on it. Look, we did have opposition parties in the past but, well, maybe they were too weak to do anything, you know. This time I'm making sure we get a better life. I'm voting with my head, not my heart. I'm voting for the new National Party." The advertisement is followed by the voices singing: "Be sure of a better life for you." At the beginning and end of the advertisement an announcer says: "This political advertisement was paid for by the party."
