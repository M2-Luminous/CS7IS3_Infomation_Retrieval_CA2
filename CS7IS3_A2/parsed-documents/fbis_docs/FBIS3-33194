Martin Equihua, leader of the Indian group, pointed out that approximately 560 representatives from Guerrero ethnic groups will begin marching toward the Mexican capital on 21 February so as to "not leave the Chiapas Indians without support." The march will begin at Chilpancingo, 210 km south of Mexico City. He said this organization "supports" the rebellion started by the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) on 1 January, but, after meeting with Guerrero Indian communities, it agreed "not to take up arms because we are going to follow the path of a peaceful and legal organization and to more enthusiastically promote the political demands" of the rebels. In a message that did not specify if they were requesting military or simply political support, the Zapatist rebels asked the Guerrero Council "not to leave them alone" in their fight and to take our blood as nourishment." [quotation marks as received] In early February, journalist Raymundo Riva told the local EL FINANCIERO newspaper that there are reportedly 52 groups apt to engage in guerrilla warfare in Mexico. These groups could take up arms anytime; the probable date of an uprising reportedly would be in August just before the presidential elections. Equihua emphasized that the Guerrero peasants will walk 11 days before reaching Mexico City and will try to meet with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to ask him to create an autonomous fund for the development of Indian peoples and to keep the official promises to meet Guerrero State's socioeconomic demands. The Indian leader added that some 200 Nathuatlaca Indians will participate in the 21 February march, along with 150 Mixtecos, 110 Tlapenecos, and some 100 Amuzgos. These Indians live in the mountainous zones of Guerrero and will hide their faces behind balaclavas, as the EZLN rebels do. Equihua noted that the march, for which the Council has requested support from political organizations and the 56 ethnic groups that live in the country, "has no partisan or electoral goals."
