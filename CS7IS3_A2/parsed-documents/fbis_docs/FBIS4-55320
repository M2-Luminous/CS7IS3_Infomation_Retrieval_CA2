The conditions under which we are granting the loan to the National Bank, that is, to the state of Yugoslavia are in fact market conditions .... [Jevtic] The fact that banks are now giving their own money to support the program means that they have to look after it in a different, more serious manner than they have done to date. [Igic] Certainly. In fact, this money will again come to banking and financial channels through the economy. It will be a basis for general economic activity in the coming period. This money has not been given away for good ignoring this economy, our bank's savers, and our shareholders.
