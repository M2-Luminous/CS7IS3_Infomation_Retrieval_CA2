FBIS4-27879 "dreas108_d_94028" FBIS-EAS-94-108 Daily Report 5 Jun 1994 South Korea Compensation Eyed for Firms' Losses Compensation Eyed for Firms' Losses SK0506053694 Seoul MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN in Korean 5 Jun 94 p 2 SK0506053694 Seoul MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN Korean BFN [Text] It has been learned that the government is actively examining the possibility of compensating up to 90 percent of the losses from the South-North cooperative fund, if ROK companies that trade with North Korea suffer losses as a result of economic sanctions against North Korea. A high-ranking official of the National Unification Board said on 4 June: "It is expected that companies that trade with the North will suffer losses if trade between the South and North, including processing on commission, and direct and indirect trade, is entirely suspended. The government is actively examining the possibility of compensating up to 90 percent of the losses according to Article 26, which stipulates the regulations on operating and managing the South-North cooperative fund." The reason the government decided to actively examine this matter is that the losses the companies will suffer will not be due to mistakes in concluding contracts with the North Korean companies or to negligence in its management, but due to a special situation between the South and North. In April 1991, the government enacted the "regulation on operating and managing the South-North cooperative fund," and in July of the same year, 5,000 tonnes of rice were exported to North Korea. However, since our side did not receive the money for it from the Chinji Trading Company, our side received compensation for 1.268 billion won from the South-North exchange cooperative fund for the losses suffered. Currently there are 145 billion won in the South-North exchange cooperative fund. The official also said: "If we determine that the companies that conduct trade with North Korea are not able to retrieve the amount of loss or is impossible to retrieve it by the end of this year, we will receive applications from the related companies and examine whether the companies can receive assistance according to the regulation on assistance to restore national commonwealth (Chapter 9, Article 67) of the regulation on operating and managing the fund." The companies that may be able to receive compensation are Samsung Products Company; Lucky-Gold Star Trading Company; Daewoo; Kohap Trading Company; Hanil Synthetic Fiber Company; and Hyosong Products Company that exported subsidiary raw materials for processing on commission, and small-sized companies that gave money in advance under the condition that North Korea will bring in the goods.
