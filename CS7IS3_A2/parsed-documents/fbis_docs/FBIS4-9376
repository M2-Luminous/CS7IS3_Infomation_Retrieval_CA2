Zore Temelkovski, the candidate of three of the four parties in the governing coalition--the Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia (SDSM), the Liberal Party (LP), and the Socialist Party (SP) -- won 2,431 votes in the 3 April runoff election. The other two candidates were Zoran Sindiliev of the Democratic Party (DP), who received 1,641 votes, and Branislav Sinadinovski of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity (VMRO-DPMNE), who received 1,467 votes. Turnout for the election was light: Of 13,172 registered voters, only 5,822 (44.2 percent) cast ballots. According to NOVA MAKEDONIJA, both the DP and the VMRO-DPMNE have charged that the election was unfair, citing among other irregularities a "sudden change" in electoral boundaries. The number of registered voters in the district was said to have changed from 13,035 in the first round to 13,172 in the runoff. After a campaign punctuated with "desecrations" of party posters and fist-fights among the youthful fans of the rival parties (NOVA MAKEDONIJA, 16 March) the first round was held on 20 March. NOVA MAKEDONIJA of 22 March reported that the winner was Temelkovski, with 1,802 votes (about 30 percent). The runner-up, Sindiliev, received 1,473 (about 25 percent), and the third-place candidate, Sinadinovski, garnered 1,154 (about 19 percent). Another 20 percent was split among eight candidates, with the nationalistic parties winning 483 votes. According to the same NOVA MAKEDONIJA report, the DP and the VMRO-DPMNE charged that the election results were unfair because people had been allowed to vote without showing their personal identification papers as the election law stipulated. Although the Supreme Court rejected their appeals, the electoral commission decided that voters would be obliged to produce their identity cards in the second round of voting on 3 April (VECER 31 March). The governing coalition's victory brings its total seats in the 120-member parliament to 74, including those held by the Party for Democratic Prosperity (PDP), an ethnic Albanian party. The distribution of seats is as follows: VMRO-DPMNE -- 32, VMRO-Democratic Party -- 1, SDSM -- 28, SDSM-LP-SP -- 1, PDP -- 22, PDP-People's Democratic Party -- 1, LP -- 18, LP-SP -- 1, SP -- 4, Party of Yugoslavs -- 2, Party for the Full Emancipation of Romanies -- 1, DP -- 4. There are five independents. The foregoing numbers are drawn from a NOVA MAKEDONIJA series on political parties published between 22 January and 8 February, as well as press articles from 1993 and earlier. According to the FYROM Constitution, the quorum for Assembly proceedings is a majority of the total membership (61); decisions are made by a simple majority of those present, which must, however, amount to at least one-third of the total membership (40); certain laws, such as those involving changes to the country's borders, declaring war, and amending the Constitution, require a two-thirds majority (80).
