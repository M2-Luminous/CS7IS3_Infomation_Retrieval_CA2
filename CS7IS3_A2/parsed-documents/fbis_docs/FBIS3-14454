Commenting on contacts between Iraq and the French companies last Friday, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told a news conference that he would like to have a list of companies from other countries that have the same contacts with the Iraqi Government--a reference to the U.S., British, and other Western companies. Minister of Oil Safa' Hadi Jawad emphasized in a statement, published in AL-QADISIYAH last Saturday, that several major international oil companies have shown a strong desire to sign contracts with Iraq. He said negotiations with French oil companies in Paris resulted in agreements that will be implemented after the siege is lifted.
