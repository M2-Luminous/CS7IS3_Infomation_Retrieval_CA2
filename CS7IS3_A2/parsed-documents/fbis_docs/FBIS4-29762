That brought the widely watched measure of money supply -- cash in circulation, time and demand deposits, plus certificates of deposit (CDs) -- to 518.0 trillion yen, the central bank said in a preliminary report. The broad measure of liquidity, including postal savings, government debts and investment trusts, rose 3.2 percent from a year before, compared with the 3.3 percent rise in April, the report said. The lower key money supply growth in May was a reaction to the jump from a 0.5 percent year-to-year rise in April last year to a 1.5 percent yearly gain in May 1993, which was due to sluggish tax collection under the economic slowdown, said Kengo Inoue, research and statistics deputy director at the central bank. The basic trend of slow growth in money supply remained unchanged in May and will continue in June, Inoue told reporters. No factors have emerged that would revise largely either upward or downward the central bank's forecast for the April-June quarter of the 1 percent level growth from year earlier levels, he said. Within the money supply figures, time and savings deposits rose 1.1 percent in May from a year before, compared with the 1.2 percent gain in April. CDs fell for the fifth straight month, declining 18.2 percent from a year before after the 8.8 percent yearly fall in April. Inoue attributed the expanding fall in CDs mainly to fewer issuances by financial institutions as their reserve positions have improved. The 18.2 percent year-to-year decline was the biggest since March 1992, when CDs dropped 19.0 percent from a year earlier, he said.
