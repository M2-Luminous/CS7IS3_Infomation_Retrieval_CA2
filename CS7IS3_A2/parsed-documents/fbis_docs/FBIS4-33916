She explained that she had stopped the organization from accepting inaccurate proposals that attempted to obtain statements of support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Belize, thus, ignoring the existence of the territorial dispute. Confronted with such attempts, her delegation acted to safeguard the country's interests and was able to get the NAM Declaration to be more balanced, limiting it to calling upon Belize and Guatemala to discuss and resolve the dispute, which had not been achieved at this forum previously. She asserted that the government agreed with the NAM statement because Guatemala's position had not been omitted. To the benefit of both parties, the declaration backed the negotiations and, by not polarizing the situation, established the necessary climate for it, she added. She highlighted as special achievements her participation as vice president of the conference and Colombia's selection to chair the next NAM presidential summit of member countries to be held in 1998. Above all, we managed to get a special pronouncement in favor of Guatemala -- something that is uncommon -- to support the efforts being made by De Leon Carpio to further the democratization and peace processes, she emphasized. On ending, Vielman stated that the officials who attended the NAM Ministerial Conference had attempted to redefine the movement's role in the new international context and had reaffirmed its objective of furthering the developing countries' struggle to advance. The meeting was attended by 130 delegates, of which 109 were from member countries. We took advantage of this situation and held bilateral meetings with most of the representatives at the meeting, she added.
