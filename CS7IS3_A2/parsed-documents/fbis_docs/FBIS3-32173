The magistrate declined comment because public reports on the case are just opinions and cannot form the basis of a legal position. [Begin recording] [Mateu] The Court does not have a position on this case. I understand the Court president has already made statements reflecting the opinion of the Court. [Unidentified reporter] Weren't Salvadoran laws violated in this case, in the sense that, according to the prosecutor general and the director of the PNC [National Civilian Police], the judge was manipulated? They said that the supply of U.S. aid was linked to the judge not indicting the U.S. citizen. Aren't the nation's laws being manipulated? [Mateu] The Judiciary Branch is not manipulating the law. The judiciary is working to see that laws are fulfilled. But as Supreme Court... [Reporter, interrupting] Will you defend the Constitution of the Republic? No statement has been made in this regard. [Mateu] Once the recourse in this case is filed, we will have more details about this situation. But for now only opinions have been aired. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] a case of real impunity? [Mattei] Regardless of what I think, I cannot state my opinion because a recourse may be filed with this office. It would be inappropriate for me to give my opinion. [end recording] The Supreme Court official made these brief comments on this case, after having announced plans to convene a special congress of the Latin American Federation of Magistrates in this capital.
