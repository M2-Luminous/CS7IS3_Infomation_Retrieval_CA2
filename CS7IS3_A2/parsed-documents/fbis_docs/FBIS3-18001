The plan maps out action before the start of dismantling of the nuclear reactors and foresees establishment of an emergency regime in the town for the time the reactors are opened and nuclear fuel is being removed. The dismantling probably begins after April 10. Arike told BNS the leaders of the coordination commission "maintain continuous contact with the Russian side." He said a joint meeting will in the near future take place in Moscow to once more go over the action during the dismantling of the reactors. "The Estonian and the Russian commissions will in a sense fuse during the dismantling, because it calls for prompt exchange of information and joint action," the interior minister told BNS. Estonia is responsible for security measures during the operation. Arike said the police, the rescue services and the border guards will be involved. "If additional forces are needed in the area, they will be brought in from all over Estonia, not only Tallinn," the interior minister said.
