FR940621-2-00065 FR940621-2-00043 [WY&hyph;930&hyph;4210&hyph;06; WYW 130940] Notice of Open House Concerning Proposed Withdrawal; Notice of Intent To Conduct a Planning Review; Devil Canyon Area; Wyoming AGENCY: Bureau of Land Management, Interior. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Worland District, Cody Resource Area, of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) will host an open house to provide a forum to answer questions and allow public comment concerning the proposed withdrawal of public land from settlement, location, or entry under the general land laws, including the mining laws, to protect scenic, recreational, and cultural resource values in the Devil Canyon area near Lovell, Wyoming. The public is invited to participate. All comments will be considered when a final determination is made on whether this land should be withdrawn. In addition, the open house will provide the public an opportunity to identify concerns to be addressed in a planning review of existing management prescriptions associated with management of the resource values in Devil Canyon. DATES: July 21, 1994, 5:00&hyph;9:00 p.m. ADDRESSES: The open house will be held at the National Guard Armory located at 360 East Fifth in Lovell, Wyoming. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dave Atkins, District Outdoor Recreation Planner at the Bureau of Land Management, Worland District Office, P.O. Box 119, Worland, Wyoming 82401&hyph;0119, 307&hyph;347&hyph;9871. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Notice of Proposed Withdrawal for the Devil Canyon area was published in the Federal Register on February 1, 1994 (Vol. 59, No. 21, page 4721), and involves 7,202 acres of public land and Federal minerals, and 320 acres of Federal minerals underlying private lands in Big Horn County, Wyoming. This area includes portions of Porcupine Creek, Oasis Spring, Trout Creek, and Deer Creek drainages, near Lovell, Wyoming. The open house will also provide the public an opportunity to evaluate the implications, needs, and issues associated with management of the unique scenic, recreational, and cultural values located in the Devil Canyon area. The resource values involved were instrumental in identifying much of the BLM administered public lands in the area under review for special management emphasis and designation as an area of critical environmental concern (ACEC), and in the BLM lands along the mentioned waterways being found to meet the Wild and Scenic Rivers suitability factors. The planning review will identify any need for additional management prescriptions or actions, as appropriate. Management actions to consider include closure of the area to settlement, location, or entry under the general land laws, including the mining laws. If the final determinations of the planning review result in withdrawing the lands as proposed or in changing any other existing management direction or adding new management direction for the BLM administered public lands involved, the Cody Resource Management Plan (RMP) would be amended, accordingly, in the process. The open house will be held jointly with the Forest Service, since the upper portion of Porcupine Creek has also been proposed for withdrawal by the Forest Service. Interested parties may provide written statements within 30 days after the open house to the State Director, Bureau of Land Management, Wyoming State Office, P.O. Box 1828, Cheyenne, Wyoming 82003. Dated: June 16, 1994. F. William Einkenberry, Associate State Director. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;15114 Filed 6&hyph;20&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;22&hyph;P
