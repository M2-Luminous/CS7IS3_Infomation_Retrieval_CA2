Why was the parliament of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina not in session last week, between 28 and 30 April as announced ? [Bender] We had several discussions with the Muslim side and we agreed that the constituent assembly should take place at the end of April. However, the Muslim side did not respect the agreement and the assembly did not take place because there was nothing to discuss. We should begin implementing the agreement in principle -- the selection of cadres and demarcation on the ground -- and we should adopt the constitution. [Correspondent] There are two problems regarding the selection of cadres: Things seem to be stuck in connection with the posts of the president of the federation and the prime minister. [Bender] This is a problem because the Muslim side wants to keep both the post of the president of the federation and the post of the premier. This is not logical and we have made our standpoints clear through the presidency of the Croatian Democratic Union [HDZ] and the presidential council of Herceg-Bosna. We cannot change this and there is no reason why we should. One of the top posts must be given to the Croats. In this case it is a priority, having in mind that Alija Izetbegovic has been the president of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina for four years now. If we want to have some kind of continuity as we have said earlier then it is logical that the Croats should have 50 percent of the posts in the Federation in the forthcoming period. [Correspondent] What do you have to say about Alija Izetbegovic's appeal to President Tudjman, urging the implementation of the Washington agreement, if you think that the Muslim side does not want to implement the initial steps as far as the constitution is concerned. [Bender] I believe that it is an attempt to relegate responsibility from the Muslim side to us Croats. I believe that the world will find it easy to see through this attempt. At our last meeting in Sarajevo, which was attended by Mr. Silajdzic with his team and by us from Herceg-Bosna it was obvious... [pauses] The U.S. envoy was present there as well as the Croatian ambassador to Bosnia-Herzegovina. They attended the meeting and they could see for themselves. We gave our proposals and an alternative while the Muslims did not. [Bender] Consequently, one can see -- I can state in clear terms -- that the Muslims are not interested in implementing the agreement. If they were interested they would take steps, as it is their turn now. We agreed that they should convene the next meeting of our working groups so we can embark on the next round of talks. [Correspondent] Why should they do it? [Bender] Because it was we who requested and organized both meetings. It is Silajdzic's turn, that is, his team and Alija Izetbegovic. We expect, we are willing, to continue talks wherever and whenever. But these talks should be within the framework of the constitution and the agreement. By no means can we go beyond this. [Correspondent] Mr. Bender, both you and President Zubak as well as the chairman of the executive board of the Croatian Democratic Community, Markovic, frequently stress that you are not going to tolerate a situation in which Croat cadres in the federation are appointed by someone else. What are you referring to, precisely? [Bender] I believe that everyone is aware that the HDZ is the only legal and legitimate representative of the Croats in the area of Bosnia-Herzegovina, including the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. It is logical then that all the rights to elect and appoint cadres to any position and represent the Croats are vested in the HDZ. [Correspondent] Who does want to manage cadres instead of the HDZ? Tell us explicitly. [Bender] There are attempts by those people in the so-called HNV [Croat National Council], headed by Ivo Komsic, to appropriate some kind of right at their talks with Sarajevo's HDZ city branch. We have been present there on three occasions. One should listen to these people and understand what they think about that tiny bunch who gather there and call themselves representatives of the HNV. The leadership of the HDZ Sarajevo city branch are firmly in line with the policy of the HDZ and the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. [Correspondent] Who supports the HNV and its policy of appointing cadres, as you say? [Bender] In our area, I believe, no one supports them. I also firmly believe that the HNV's policy and that tiny bunch who call themselves HNV are behind everything that is going on in the area of our state of Croatia. [Presenter] And lastly, what next? [Bender] I believe that it is in the interest of both the Muslims and the Croats to try and implement this skeletal agreement, the Washington agreements and our constitution. Over the next few days we are going to wait and see what the other side does. We must make use of this period of cease-fire and consolidate our ranks. We must primarily improve some things in our army, in our police and in political life and the economy. Wherever it is possible, production should be revived. I believe that our visits, ranging from president Zubak to Markovic and everyone else among us who is touring the area, we must implement some things on the ground. [sentence as heard] We must return to the creation of living conditions.
