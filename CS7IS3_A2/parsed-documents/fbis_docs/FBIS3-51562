Here is an interview with President Guillermo Endara and [Arnulfista Party President] Mireya Moscoso de Gruber. [Begin recording] [Endara] That is my party's decision. I must express my profound disappointment with those who were my friends in Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement] and who enjoyed great friendship, trust, and power during my administration. I think they have been ungrateful to the Arnulfista Party. I think their attitude of scorn toward the Arnulfista Party is similar to what occurred with the Christian Democratic Party [PDC] a few years ago. I am deeply hurt because my party has been despised and because Mireya Moscoso de Gruber has been despised. She is very important to us and to me. Mireya was Arnulfo Arias Madrid's wife. She took care of him and helped him. She was his loyal and permanent companion. We Arnulfistas love her very much. Personally speaking, I love her very much and I must express my support for her at this time. [Reporter] Will there be any changes in your government as a result of this? [Endara] Those decisions will be made next week. There will undoubtedly be changes. [applause] [Reporter] President, what is your opinion of the slate? [Endara] There will be changes. [Reporter] Mr. President, what is your opinion of the slate? [Endara] I think the slate is a slate for the people. The alliance I tried to achieve, meaning the alliance Arnulfo Arias tried to achieve between vested interests and the Panamanian people, represented by the Arnulfista Party, worked during my government. However, it is obvious that vested interests want to usurp power and take complete control. [Reporter] President, do you still believe in political miracles? [Endara] What happened today is a political miracle because now the people are with the people. [Reporter] Who are these vested interests that want to seize power? [Endara] The Panamanian people know who they are, and you know who they are. They are vested interests that want to seize power. [Reporter] Gentlemen, just a minute please, you are blocking the light. Mrs. Mireya, please, your views about the people who will accompany you in the slate? [Gruber] This evening, almost at 2100, the Liberal Authentic Party [PLA], the Liberal Party, and the Arnulfista Party reached an agreement on a slate. We have a doctor, Arnulfo Escalona, a man who has worked hard. He is well-known in this country. We also have Dr. Teran, a young man, 36 years old, who wants...[pauses] who knows this represents a sacrifice but wants to work hard for a better Panama. [Reporter] What do you think? What kind of campaign will you conduct given that there is a marked division? [Gruber] We...[pauses] our campaign is dedicated to the humble people, the poor. We will have nothing to do with any party. The Arnulfista Party will start working on Monday, so I do not worry about the other parties. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] Liberal Party members have traditionally opposed Arnulfista views and positions? [Gruber] Well, we have been working with the PLA since 1984. We now have the Liberal Party. We have worked very well with the PLA, and I know we will work well with the Liberal Party. [Reporter] Who will be your main adversary? What is the outlook? [Gruber] I have always recognized and said that the only adversary here is the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party]. The other are not, only the PRD. [Reporter] Mrs. Mireya, your opinion about Molirena's decision to abandon the alliance? [Gruber] They objected only to one electoral circuit. That is why they left. Therefore, I do not think they had a good reason. They did not want to be with the Arnulfista Party any longer. That was all. [end recording]
