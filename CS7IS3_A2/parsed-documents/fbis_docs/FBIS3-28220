In January, Korean oil companies imported petroleum for 13 to 14 U.S. dollars per barrel, but as the current price is 15 dollars it is necessary to reduce oil prices by 4 to 5 percent, Director General Han Chun-ho said. Han announced on Friday at a seminar sponsored by the Korea Petroleum Association that the government would adopt a policy linking domestic oil prices to the average price of petroleum imported the previous month and to exchange rates. Han added that the government will adjust domestic oil prices on the 15th day of every month. Under the plan, the government will announce oil prices on the 14th of every month through the Korea Petroleum Association and apply the new prices on the 15th. The government plans to limit its involvement in deciding oil prices, but if a sudden international incident arises like the Gulf crisis and prices increase sharply, it will intervene in setting prices to prevent economic disorder. However, the government will continue to control the price of liquefied petroleum gas.
