Our correspondent told us that Israel asked for the postponement for two reasons: 1. To try to hold secret talks with Syria parallel to the Israeli-Palestinian talks in Oslo. The [London-based] AL-HAYAH reported this, citing Syrian sources. It said the Israeli negotiators have asked for secret negotiations, but the Syrians have been categorically rejecting any secret contacts or any departure from the course of the negotiations as established in Madrid and continued in Washington. 2. To take a break to assess the results of Geneva summit between Presidents Clinton and al-Asad. These two reasons have been confirmed, as our correspondent told us in a direct telephone call this morning. He added a third reason: [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] The two reasons have been confirmed, and our radio has learned of a third Israeli reason for the postponement: Raising the level of representation at the next round of talks. During their meeting, Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres asked U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to try to get the concerned Arab parties, especially Syria and Lebanon, to raise the level of negotiations. [end recording] Our correspondent said that no official date for the resumption of the 12th round of peace talks has been fixed. The negotiations will resume on 15 February at the chief delegates' level. What did the State Department spokesman say? [Begin correspondent recording] A State Department spokesman said that after consultations with the concerned parties, the cosponsors of the peace process proposed suspension of the peace talks being conducted at the chief delegate level for a short time to give the parties enough time to consult with their governments. The negotiations will resume on 15 February with the same format--at the chief delegate level. The truth, however, is that the U.S. announcement is based on an Israeli request. Heads of the Arab delegations, therefore, are dissatisfied. In our conversations with them, the heads of the Lebanese and Syrian delegations did not show any enthusiasm for the decision, and they initially decided to stay in Washington during the hiatus and to contact their governments by telephone and facsimile. The U.S. State Department spokesman ruled out the possibility that a tour of the Middle East by Secretary of State Warren Christopher is imminent. [end recording] [passage omitted]
