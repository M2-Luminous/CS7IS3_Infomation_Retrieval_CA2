The sources said the government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa plans to complete the package by the end of March to pave the way for resumption of stalled negotiations with the United States on a new framework for bilateral trade. Washington strongly demanded income tax cuts on a continuous basis as part of macroeconomic measures to promote Japanese imports and slash the country's swollen trade surplus. The sources said the package will also include a further increase in outlays for public works projects over the 430 trillion yen called for under the present program. The size of the increment will be decided by the end of June when the government will prepare another round of market-opening measures, the sources said. They said the government hopes the new package, to be worked out by the end of this month, will satisfy the U.S. and pave the way for resumption of trade negotiations between the two countries. The program will include measures for areas of principal U.S. interest, such as participation in government procurement, imports of automobile and auto parts and deregulation of the insurance industry, the sources said. Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy foreign minister in charge of economic affairs, told a news conference earlier Wednesday that measures for deregulation in the three priority areas are now being scrutinized in response to Hosokawa's instruction. Hayashi warned Japan will take retaliatory action under rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade if Washington imposes sanctions on the country on grounds of unfair trade practices.
