['Arafat] Either, and I wonder about this, it is that Rabin knows what is going on but is turning a blind eye, or that these acts are being committed by Israeli army units without Rabin's knowledge. In either case, it is a terrible situation that will have a grave effect on the entire peace process. There are formations within the Israeli Army... [pauses] We are facing the same experience as our brothers the Algerians in Evian [Algerian pre-independence talks with the French] when an organization named OAS, or the Secret Army Organization, was formed from French Army personnel and French settlers. Now we are facing the same [type of] secret organization. [Qabalan] In your opinion, what is the fate of Palestinian-Israeli talks in view of repeated Israeli massacres of the Palestinian people and PLO activists? ['Arafat] There have been no... [pauses] There are no negotiations. What is happening is simply this: When they [Israeli officials] came here, they said: We will give you the final answer after going back to Rabin. We will convey the answer during the donors meeting. The donors meeting was held in Cairo last Thursday [24 March], but nothing happened. They postponed the answer till today, Tuesday. [Qabalan] And, today? ['Arafat] Today, before they gave the answer, the crime took place, the second massacre took place. Therefore, these are premeditated acts, no more and no less. I lay the responsibility at the doorstep of the co-sponsors of the [peace] conference. [Qabalan] What, then, is the Israeli delegation doing in Cairo now? ['Arafat] This delegation is not a delegation; it is an individual who will give an answer to us and to the Egyptian brothers. [Qabalan] Thank you, President.
