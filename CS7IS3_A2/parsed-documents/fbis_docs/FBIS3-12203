This outrageous act, which reminds the Arabs and Muslims of the Dayr Yasin Massacre in 1948, emphasizes to the whole world the extreme seriousness of the continuing Israeli occupation of the territories and settling in it in contravention of all laws and statutes and as a flagrant challenge to the UN resolutions and Charter. It has become clear to the entire international community that Israel's intransigent stands, expansionist aims, and the policies of evasion and procrastination which it has been following in the peace talks for more than two years are the primary cause of the acts of violence in the occupied Arab territories. Israel is responsible, directly or indirectly, for extremism in the region. Syria, which is aware that the whole world deplores this savage massacre, is well aware that words of denunciation and condemnation are not enough to end the circles of violence and terror, and that an end to the Israeli occupation without further procrastination and stalling within the framework of the current peace talks [fi itari muhadathat al-salam al-jariyah] and allowing the Palestinian people to acquire their right of self-determination will ensure ending extremism and acts of violence and realizing just and comprehensive peace in the region.
