This is a strange situation in which even the President is not hesitating to talk about a "trade war" between Japan and the United States. Both countries declared, after the framework talks broke up, that they would resume the framework talks after a "cooling-off period." But the character of the U.S. negotiating team, the team's attitude in the talks, the pressure it is receiving, as well as its views on the politics of Japan have changed greatly from the past. If Japan fails to recognize this change adequately, another rupture in the talks is possible. What has changed in this era of "mature" frictions? We will examine it. Compromise Comes Only at Last Moment One of the U.S. congressional staff members blamed the rupture in the talks on the presumptuous force of the "lawyer mafiosi" such as U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] Mickey Kantor and Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshevsky. Another official said, "The only way they know how to do things is to demand the highest possible price, and then to bargain at the last moment." They overdid it this time, and they failed. The USTR with his lawyer's seriousness persisted with the "numerical targets" issue, warding off attempts to attach loopholes to them. There is no denying that this made a political decision difficult. In Japan, there are wishful voices saying, "If only Kantor were not there" (to quote one of negotiating team's members), but (according to a White House staff member), his political standing now is "very strong, for he is close to Mrs. Clinton." The NEC's Predominance The power of the National Security Council (NSC), which used to have the final say on Japanese-U.S. relations during the cold war, is now falling fast with the appearance of its rival, the National Economic Council (NEC), which is having a great impact. Particularly with respect to economic relations with Japan, the NEC's power is clearly predominant. In the "mature" relationship, which may mean having economic matters handled separately from political and security matters, this state of the NSC being unable to fully interfere in the NEC's formulation of policies on Japan is likely to become permanent. Gephardt During the days of the Republican government, the issues of trade with Japan were always a "political football" to be kicked around between the government and the Democratic-led Congress. There were signs that the Democratic Congress bashed Japan in order to bash the Republican government. Now both the government and Congress are headed by the Democrats, but the "political football" is being kicked around between President Clinton and the protectionist force of House majority leader Gephardt, who is supported by major trade unions. There is a strong residue of hard feelings after the President enlisted the help of the Republican Party in pushing for NAFTA in the face of labor's objections to this treaty. The trade issues with Japan are thus also being used as a "compensating" mechanism by which the President wants to restore his relations with labor. Business Japanese-U.S. trade frictions -- whether in the framework talks or concerning sanctions -- are almost always the upshot of persistent campaigns waged by one or two companies or the heads of these companies. Many times, lobbying efforts in Washington by top executives of Cray Computers or the Motorola company have simply turned into demands made by the U.S. Government of the Japanese Government. "Previously, leaders of major corporations got together and agreed on what the government should demand of other countries, but there is no longer such a group of leaders who share the government's goals," said Mr. Donald Gartin of the Atlantic Council, who used to be involved in business roundtable talks by big business associations. Besides, high-tech businesses have close relations with the Defense Department (Pentagon). Since the end of the cold war, the Pentagon has been active in promoting the development of the high-tech industry. This is also creating a new perspective within the Pentagon concerning Japan, with the former coming to consider it a "rival" rather than an "ally." Almost all the members of the U.S. negotiating team are persons who have the experience of having earlier done business in Japan or with Japan. What is common among these people is the conviction that "the Japanese market is not open; Japan is not like other countries." Mr. Robert Kief, a political consultant, said: "The allegations that the U.S. Government has no people who know Japan are totally groundless. It is full of people who know Japan. But the problem is that they know Japan wrongly." The argument of the so-called revisionists about "Japan being unlike other countries" which emerged in the late 1980's is now losing its impact among intellectuals, but it appears that such a way of thinking is only gaining force among the people occupying the political and economic circles. An official close to President Clinton said that the president is one of these people. According to the official, one of the reasons why the President decided to break up the talks was out of concern that "the economic recession in Japan is not as serious as is reported, and that Japan will pull through this and will become even stronger." Is this an expression of the belief that "Japan is different from other ordinary countries?"
