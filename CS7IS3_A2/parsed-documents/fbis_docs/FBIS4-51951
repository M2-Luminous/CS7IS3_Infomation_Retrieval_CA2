Calling for an immediate and unconditional general cease-fire in which each side must implement an end to activities; 2. Calling on the two sides to immediately send two generals -- two from each side -- to set up a cease-fire observation committee under the chairmanship of Your Majesty; and 3. A roundtable meeting will take place in the Royal Palace or in the (?Chhang Sun-on) royal residence when the cease-fire has been truly and permanently implemented across Cambodia. I would like to be permitted to inform Your Majesty of the following: I. I am delighted to abide by Your Majesty's formal and solemn proposal for a concrete and permanent cease-fire throughout the country because a cease-fire constitutes an initial step toward national reconciliation, peace, and genuine independence, which represent the desire of Democratic Kampuchea as well as the aspiration of the Cambodian nation and every Cambodian citizen since long ago. II. I would like to inform Your Majesty that the cease-fire should be truly, concretely, and permanently implemented because it is the vital need of the entire Cambodian nation and people who have suffered for more than 15 years due to the Vietnamese war of aggression which continues to this day. III. I would like to inform Your Majesty about the cease-fire issue. It is an old problem that has been discussed for years. It was raised before the existence of the Paris accord and during the Paris conference in 1989. At subsequent meetings in other places this matter was also raised. Nevertheless, it has never been implemented concretely. This has led the general public to believe that it is a maneuver or a trick repeatedly employed by the aggressors to serve their strategic purpose. For example: A. In December 1978, Pham Van Dong [former Vietnamese prime minister] declared to the ASEAN countries that the SRV did not need to invade Cambodia. The statement was an answer to questions by [word indistinct] ASEAN spokesmen who were anxious about Vietnam's preparations to invade Cambodia. Immediately afterwards, when Pham Van Dong had not yet even taken a plane to return to Hanoi, several hundred thousand Vietnamese troops had already invaded Cambodia in an aggressively arrogant and insolent manner. B. The 23 October 1991 Paris accord is a tremendous and vitally important document that took the world and United Nations several months or years to map out. The document has a balanced essence that could bring about a cease-fire, national reconciliation, and peace in Cambodia. Nonetheless, it has been shredded and trampled upon at will. That being the case, peace can never be restored in accordance with the accord's essence and spirit, and the flames of war have continued. C. After the UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia] organized elections and the formation of a government with two prime ministers, they began to inflame an undeclared war. Apparently, they immediately attacked Democratic Kampuchea at Phnum Chhat [in Banteay Meanchey Province] and Stoung [in Kompong Thom Province] in August (?1993). Between September and November 1993, they continued to attack the people and Democratic Kampuchea at Anlung Veng without caring in the least about peace and national reconciliation, which are profoundly desired by our nation and people, and without considering the spirit and essence of the Paris accord. In January and February 1994, they continued to thunderously attack the people and Democratic Kampuchea at Anlung Veng. In March and April 1994, they continued to attack Pailin and openly declared war with Democratic Kampuchea. The two prime ministers of the two-headed government and their ministers, deputy ministers, and commanders all declared war against Democratic Kampuchea. They said they would at all costs destroy Democratic Kampuchea in northern and western Cambodia. They do not want national reconciliation and they have repeatedly raised their three conditions to destroy Democratic Kampuchea. IV. Presently, the situation concerning national and social issues and the war situation in Cambodia continually being waged by the communist Vietnamese and their puppets and an alliance and its cronies are further deteriorated. The problem of implanting millions of old and new Vietnamese in Cambodia in accordance with the strategic goal of swallowing and turning Cambodia into a second Kampuchea Kroam has become increasingly serious. In fact, Vietnam has already swallowed half of Cambodia. As such, it does not need to spit out Cambodia or solve problems to achieve national reconciliation, unity, and peace in the country. Many social problems have seriously worsened and the economy and finance have become paralyzed. The subsistence of the two-headed government is supported only by communist Vietnamese muscle and force and the alliance's meager financial aid. Therefore, a cease-fire or a non- cease-fire depends on this situation. It is the communist Vietnamese and the alliance who are the masters, not the Cambodians. They do not need a cease-fire; do not need national reconciliation, national unity, and peace; and do not need to allow Cambodia to exist as an independent and neutral country within its territorial integrity. Because of these reasons, the cease-fire initiated by the two-headed government is not sincere. It is only a poisonous trick which they have raised on many occasions previously. V. Regarding the issue of sending two generals to participate on the committee for overseeing a concrete, true, and permanent cease-fire under His Majesty's august chairmanship, I clearly understand that this problem is an important matter that needs to be pondered and that military personnel from both sides need to be present to achieve good results and a definite cease-fire, thereby restoring peace to Cambodia. I believe that discussions and negotiations concerning the cease-fire, which is an important issue, should take place in a safe area. Phnom Penh is in the hands of the communist Vietnamese, the alliance, the communist Vietnamese puppets, and the two-headed government, all of whom have a policy and concrete actions, about which I have already informed Your Majesty above, to permanently destroy Democratic Kampuchea. Evidently, on 27 November 1991, when I and H.E. Son Sen returned to Phnom Penh to participate in the implementation of the Paris accord, since all of us have the goodwill to implement the accord correctly, the communist Vietnamese and the alliance organized communist Vietnamese commandos and the cat's-paws of the Vietnamese puppet State of Cambodia to attack us. They went so far as to strike me in the head until it bled. In sum, I understand that His Majesty, with such important work in dealing with the destiny of our Cambodian nation and motherland, wants negotiations on the cease-fire to be held in a safe place inside or outside the country. VI. I, like our entire nation and people, wish to express to Your Majesty my total and constant hope that one day a roundtable meeting for peace and national reconciliation will certainly take place at a neutral site inside or outside the country. The information that I have presented to Your Majesty above ensues from Democratic Kampuchea's firm and constant stance of shouldering the responsibility for the issue of life and death of the Cambodian nation and race.
