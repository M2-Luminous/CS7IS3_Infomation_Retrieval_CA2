Enough mistakes have been committed thus far, the primary mistake being the breakup of Yugoslavia. Europeans played a pioneering role in this breakup, which opened the road to bloodshed and the current deadlocks. It would be a disastrous mistake, because in no case should any other Balkan country become involved in the Balkan crisis and, moreover, a country which had a historic involvement and expansionist designs. It is obvious that Turkey does not seek a peacemaking role in the Yugoslav crisis. It seeks to be present and exert influence in the former provinces that were enslaved by the Ottoman Empire. Therefore, it would be a provocation for all the Balkan peoples if their former oppressor returned allegedly as peacemaker. Turkey is seeking a role in the Balkans and without any loss, as is always the case. It seeks this role at a time when the Turkish economy is threatened with a collapse since all its exchange reserves have been exhausted. In addition, Turkey is also facing a lot of internal problems with open fronts in the Kurdish areas. The United Nations and, above all, the European Union cannot ignore the elements of the Yugoslav crisis and throw oil on the Bosnian fire when the danger of a more general conflagration is obvious. It is precisely because of this danger that there is an unwillingness by many countries to send the Blue Helmets to Bosnia-Herzegovina. In spite of this, there is an offer sufficient to cover the needs by countries that have no connection with the Balkans. Greece ought to persist firmly on its stance and prevent by all means the dispatch of Turkish or other troops from any Balkan country. Lack of forethought by the international community could turn back the clock of history and cause a conflagration with unpredictable consequences. So, they must study history and the peculiarity of the Balkan region before making any offhand decision. They have done enough that is not to their credit regarding the bloodshed and deadlocks in the former Yugoslavia.
