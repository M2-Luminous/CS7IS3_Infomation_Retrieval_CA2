Unlike the UK, information still emerges there because it is frequently in the self-interest of member states to leak their "reasonable" arguments -- and the "unreasonable" positions of their opponents. But leaks come with much spin and heavy bias. What is missing is a public right to know -- which would provide access to briefing documents so that there could be unbiased accounts of what is happening. A new era of openness was supposed to have begun in January. Both the Maastricht and Copenhagen summits embraced the idea of freedom of information. Hail transparency! The Brussels bureaucracy obliged with codes of conduct, rules and regulations supposed to open the European Union's windows. Out went the old approach: everything is secret unless a decision is taken to make it available. In came the new: everything is accessible, unless there are good reasons to withhold it. Yet, at its first test, the new system has collapsed. A request from our European Affairs Editor in Brussels for a series of background documents on different decisions has ended in farce. A few documents were initially released. We obtained the documents behind Britain's controversial opt-out from the European directive to protect child workers, but were denied all papers concerning the Justice Council. Yet the grounds on which access was denied -- that the papers included official deliberations -- applied equally to the papers released. When this contradiction was pointed out, Brussels produced a response worthy of Sir Humphrey: the justice division (which withheld its documents) was right, the social affairs department (which released its documents) was wrong. It is not just the windows which Brussels wants closed, but the shutters as well. The root of the problem is not difficult to identify: the vagueness of the European Union's commitment. The Maastricht Declaration on the right of access to information could not have been clearer: "Transparency strengthens the democratic nature of the institutions." The code which followed has a list of perfectly respectable exemptions (public security, monetary stability, commercial interests), but also a catch-all exemption worthy of a totalitarian state: the right to refuse access "in order to protect the institution's interest in the confidentiality of its proceedings." To their credit, the Dutch object to this sweeping clause. The fight is only beginning. As the European Ministers themselves declared at Maastricht: the right to know is a fundamental way of strengthening public confidence in Europe's institutions.
