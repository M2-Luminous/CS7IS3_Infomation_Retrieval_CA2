It is expected to be held either in Islamabad or in Tehran. According to the Tajik Embassy in Moscow, the opposition does not insist on Emomali Rakhmonov, chairman of the republic's Supreme Soviet, being there. The ITAR-TASS correspondent learned from the same sources that by and large the Dushanbe delegation positively assesses the results of the first round, at which agreement was reached with the opposition not to allow hostile actions on the Afghan-Tajik border. The sides have expressed their determination to continue dialogues and to seek a compromise, even though their stands on the agenda remain unchanged. Thus, the Dushanbe delegation still believes it is advisable first to ensure peace on the Afghan-Tajik border and the return of refugees, and then to hold a referendum on the Tajik constitution and presidential elections. On the other hand, the opposition will come to the next round with the same package of documents as before concerning the refugee problem, political settlement in the country, the revocation of the ban on the activities of political parties and movements, setting up a State Council made up of independent persons, and a referendum on the constitution. The first round of talks between the Tajik authorities and the opposition has been taking place in Moscow since 6 April. On 17 April Hoji Akbar Turajonzoda, one of the eminent opposition leaders, arrived from Islamabad to take part. Also present has been Muhammadsharif Himmatzoda, chairman of the Islamic Rebirth Party. The talks have been conducted with the assistance of Ramiro Piriz Ballon, the UN secretary general's special envoy in Tajikistan.
