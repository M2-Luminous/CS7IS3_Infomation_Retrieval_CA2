Hello Hypercrisis?"] [Text] For the first time in a long period monthly inflation rates have dropped to 10 and even 8 percent. Russia's President Yeltsin is also optimistic. In his recent interview with the journal SPIEGEL he announced that this year would become a year of stabilization for the country's economy. However, experience suggests that to trust the optimism of politicians, especially those at the helm, is a risky thing. How stable can the emerging process of decline in the level of inflation be considered? This is the question. On the one hand, if for some time the government succeeds in holding back the rates of rise in prices and even in lowering them a tiny bit, this will signify the fulfillment of our obligations to the world financial community. Consequently, we will have the right to expect new 1.5 billion dollars from the International Monetary Fund and a reduction in the rate [of interest] on international credits. Both "gifts," if we get them, will be most timely for Russia. However, first, how many times has the International Monetary Fund already failed to live up to our expectations, putting off again and again under various formal pretexts the presentation of expensive "gifts"? Second, I am afraid that we ourselves can give it such a serious reason for the next delay that it will need no formalities. The crisis in industry is growing. Instead of the expected 10 to 12 percent of reduction in the general industrial level of production, during the first quarter the real decline made up 25 percent of the level during the first quarter of last year. Whereas in January it made up 23 percent, in March, already 27 percent. With due regard for inflation the annual volume of sectors' profit decreased to one-third! Only the fact that for now the authorities have not brought themselves to turn on the bankruptcy mechanism in the country to the extent to which it is stipulated by corresponding legislation saves sectors from the inevitable collapse. However, will Staraya Ploshchad be so undecided for long? Last week Russia's president sent a letter to the premier, in which he recommended that the bankruptcy procedure be used more actively for the solution of the nonpayment problem. If the cabinet of ministers heeds the supreme counsel, one can say with confidence that in the textile industry alone one-fourth of the enterprises will be auctioned off. The situation in other sectors is not much better. Hundreds and hundreds of enterprises all over the country are being closed for the May--more accurately, Easter--"vacation," which promises to extend over several weeks. The curtailment of production, inevitably, will be followed by a new price jump: Goods will appear on counters, but demand will remain at the previous level. This will provoke the next inflationary wave. This is price stabilization for you... "We must get used to living in a state of constant crisis. This process of convulsions in the economy will last more than one decade"--such is the opinion of the famous Russian economist Nikolay Shmelev. To be sure, this is a gloomy forecast. Only massive, including foreign, investments in industry are capable of reviving production. In our country during all of last year they totaled a little more than 1 billion dollars. For comparison: In China they exceeded 150 billion dollars and even in Hungary, so tiny as compared with Russia, they reached 5 billion. There is nothing surprising here: Few people who want to invest a great deal of money in enterprises, which will collapse any day now, will be found. As it seems to me, the following conclusion suggests itself: Of the two evils--inflation and production decline--inflation, of course, on a moderate scale, should still be picked.
