"The settlers must leave the settlements quickly, otherwise our fighters will strike them," the fundamentalist group said in a statement. The statement did not set a specific deadline. On March 7 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, the armed wing of Hamas, gave settlers until March 15 to leave four settlements in the occupied West Bank -- Tekoa, Kyriat Arba', Ar'iel and Keddumim -- and Gush Katif in the Gaza Strip. Hamas also declared the 25th of each month to be a day of strikes and protests to remember the 30 Palestinian worshippers shot dead by an Israeli settler in Hebron's Tomb of the Patriarchs on February 25. The fundamentalist group also called on all Palestinians to pray at the al-Aqsa mosque in the Old City of Jerusalem on March 18 in an act of defiance against the Israeli authorities. Since the massacre the army has banned Palestinians from the occupied territories from visiting Israel proper.
