The 10-odd large and medium-sized power plants that the autonomous region has newly built and expanded or is going to build through various investment forms during recent years have provided broad prospects for the local conversion of raw coal. A new pattern of simultaneously developing coal and electricity is being formed in the region. The past situation of mainly relying on railways to transport coal from the north to the south and delivering coal from the west to the east has been gradually substituted by aerial power transmission. Being China's second largest coal base, Inner Mongolia has so far formed a raw coal annual production capacity of 50 million tonnes. However, its external transport capacity is only 30 percent of the total output. More than 50 percent of the coal pits in the three major coal mines in the western part of the region are forced to suspend production; the coal pits under three bureaus and one mine in the eastern part of the region are running under capacity, and are difficult to move ahead; and only one-fourth of the dressed coal produced by Dongsheng and the "white coal" produced by Gulaben which are famous at home and abroad can be transported out of the region. To this end, guided by the state strategy of shifting energy development to the west, the regional party committee and government have promptly readjusted the development strategy. Secretary Wang Qun proposed the idea of "giving priority to developing electricity, using electricity to guarantee coal industry and coal industry to promote power industry, and transmitting more electricity to other localities outside the region." From 1988 to 1993, our region made an investment of 4.8 billion yuan to help add an installed power capacity of 1.5 million kw. A large number of major power projects were distributed and successively initiated in selected areas where coal resources are concentrated. The first phase of the Fengzhen Power Plant with an installed capacity of 800,000 kw has been completed, two power generating units of Jungar Power Plant each with a capacity of 100,000 kw have been put into production, the first power generating unit of Haibowan Power Plant with a capacity of 100,000 kw has been operated for commercial purpose, and the two power generating unit expansion projects of Huiliuhe Power Plant each with a capacity of 50,000 kw have begun to feed the power grid. Construction of the newly built exceptionally big Dalad Power Plant and the Haibowan and Huolinhe Power Plants, and the two expansion projects of Yuanbaoshan and Tongliao Power Plants is making headway. A new pattern of simultaneously building Wuhai, Wangli, Shengli, Baorixile, Yimin, Huolinhe, and Pingzhuang large-scale coal production bases and developing power industry is being formed in close connection with power development. At present, the two leading industries of coal and electricity are unceasingly exploring ways to seek conversion in an effort to broaden the development path. Three kinds of local conversions of raw coal are seen. First, the mine-run type--coal mines run power industry and build pit-head power stations. The first phase of the Huolinhe open-cut mine project of building two power generating units each with a capacity of 100,000 kw is in full swing. This coal mine has already formed an annual production capacity of 10 million tonnes and its final goal is to have an annual capacity of producing an output of 30 million tonnes of raw coal. Second, the combined-track type--the coal and power industries make joint efforts in operation and combine their systems together. At present, Yiminhe open-cut mine has already formed an annual production capacity of 1 million tonnes; the first phase of the Yimin Power Plant which is under construction includes the building of two power generating units each with a capacity of 500,000 kw; and the coal, electricity, and road projects of Jungar will all be put into production this year. Third, the simultaneously developed type--unified plans are adopted in coal and energy developments to seek coordinated and simultaneous development. The construction of Wanli mining area with a final scale of producing 45 million tonnes of raw coal annually and the Dalad Power Plant with an installed capacity of 5 million kw is being carried out in a coordinated and simultaneous manner. Construction of Shengli Coal Mine with a total scale of producing 30 million tonnes of raw coal annually and Zhenglan Banner Power Plant with a designed capacity of 3.6 million kw is being planned and carried out simultaneously so that the scale and development of these two projects will keep pace with each other.
