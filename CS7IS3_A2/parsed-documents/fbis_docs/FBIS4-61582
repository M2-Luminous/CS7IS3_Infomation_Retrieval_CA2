An ITAR-TASS correspondent was told this today when he spoke to a senior staff member of the Russian Foreign Ministry's press and information department. This first group of evacuees from among 850 Russian citizens in Yemen had first been brought from Aden (in southern Yemen) to Djibouti by sea. The foreign ministry spokesman said the evacuation from the northern part of the country will start tomorrow. A second group of Russians will be taken from Sanaa to Al-Hudaydah (a Red Sea port), where two Russian transport ships are already standing in the roadsteads, and then they will be brought home by sea. Expressing hopes that the evacuation of our fellow-countrymen will be completed successfully, the foreign ministry spokesman added that it is planned to send a further aircraft to Yemen -- this time a passenger aircraft -- for a final evacuation of people.
