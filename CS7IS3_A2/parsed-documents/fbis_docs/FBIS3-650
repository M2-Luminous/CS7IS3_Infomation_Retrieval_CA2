Speaking on SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] television, he said: "We had a specific request not to deploy the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB) in the area." Troops from the farming community were therefore sent into Mmabatho. Gen Viljoen said he was aware the AWB had arrived in Bophuthatswana but after discussions with the Bophuthatswana government he had, at 4.45 AM Friday, asked the AWB to withdraw. He was aware that a political, and not military, solution was needed in Bophuthatswana but the territory needed stability for that to take place. The Bophuthatswana government should be allowed to make a decision about the territory's continued independence without being intimidated, he said.
