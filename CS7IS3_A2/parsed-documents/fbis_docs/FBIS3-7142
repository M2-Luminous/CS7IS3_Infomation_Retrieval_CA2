In his report to the committee, he raved about someone's nonexistent provocation, babbled that strong retaliatory actions would be taken, and that he has mapped out a strategy to link this with reunification if necessary. This is a clear incitement to achieve reunification through a northward invasion which by no accounts can ever be ignored. The warmonger's blurting out about retaliatory actions directly means a war. In addition, his remark that this would be used as the opportunity to realize reunification means that South Korea will achieve reunification through a northward invasion by borrowing power from the United States. Rascal Yi Pyong-tae frankly admitted this time that it is mapping a strategy to realize the goal of invasion. This clearly shows what stage the adventurous war provocative maneuvers waged against us by the Kim Yong-sam traitorous group have reached. On 22 February, traitorous Kim Yong-sam called puppet military chieftains to Chongwadae [the presidential office] to plot a war and ordered the entire puppet Armed Forces to assume an emergency alert posture. Following this, the puppet defense minister emerged at the National Assembly and made an outburst agitating a northward invasion. These facts cannot on any account be incidental. All of these facts show that the Kim Yong-sam clique, under the aegis of the U.S. imperialists, are captured with its ambition to achieve reunification by invading and thus prevailing over the North. In addition, these clearly expose the fact that its maneuvers of heightening the tension that they have perpetrated up to now by finding faults with our nonexistent nuclear issue, are a premeditated provocation to open the road for northward invasion.
