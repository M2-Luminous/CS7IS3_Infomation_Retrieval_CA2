He has been appointed chairman of a committee which has to look into relationships between the cabinet, parliamentary members, and ordinary ANC members. Amid tension between the caucus and the cabinet, he is being regarded by certain caucus members as the right man to be their leader. Caucus members this week clearly expressed their discontent about cabinet decisions made without consultation with them. The days of "Yes Minister, No Minister, OK Minister" are gone, one member told RAPPORT. The cause of discontent this week was the fact that only a small cabinet committee of four members has been appointed to investigate the position of Cape Town and Pretoria as parliamentary capitals. The caucus demands that a fully-fledged parliamentary committee should investigate the matter. Two weeks ago individual caucus members reacted angrily to the cabinet's decision not to declare 16 June, Soweto Day, a public holiday. RAPPORT has already earlier reported on discontent within the caucus because of appointments made by President Mandela against the will of the caucus. There was also a grouse over President Mandela's failure to attend the first caucus meetings. Ever since, say ANC members, he has only attended one caucus meeting. Caucus members are also disgruntled that they were not informed that the cabinet had appointed Mr. Trevor Manuel as leader of the National Assembly. They maintain not only that they should have given some input regarding the appointment, but also that they should at least have been informed. The ANC culture that leaders cannot make decisions on their own has a long history. Since the organization was unbanned four years ago, it has been insisted on that people at ground level must be consulted on important decisions. The ANC caucus is determined to continue with this culture.
