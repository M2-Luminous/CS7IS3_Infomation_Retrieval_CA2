Until now it has been holding two plenary sessions a week -- on Wednesdays and Fridays. Communist Deputy Igor Bratishchev, who put forward the proposal for an additional sitting, noted the Duma had a lot of work to complete before deputies went off on their holidays. He observed that many deputies were neglecting their duties by not attending the Duma regularly. As an example, he cited his political opponents in the Russia's Choice group. He claimed that "30 percent of Yegor Gaydar's supporters do not turn up for plenary sessions."
