FR940317-1-00107 FR940317-1-00013 (c) When a claim under this section, notice of damage, invitation to a damage survey, or other written document indicating an intention to hold the United States liable is received, the receiving installation, office, or person, will immediately forward such document to the Commander, USARCS. The USARCS claims office receiving notice of the claim will promptly advise the claimant or potential claimant in writing of the comprehensive application of the time limit. (d) Where a claim under this section for $25,000 or less is presented to a Corps of Engineers or other designated area claims office (see §§536.128(c)) and 536.132(c) and thus may be appropriate for action by that office pursuant to the delegation of authority set forth in §536.128, the receiving Corps of Engineer office will promptly advise the claimant in writing of the comprehensive application of the time limit on the Army's authority to settle the claim as well as the fact that the claim does not toll the statute of limitations for filing suit. (See §536.21(b).) (e) Claimants are not required to file an administrative claim six months prior to filing suit except for those claims where maritime jurisdiction is based on the Act Extending the Admiralty and Maritime Jurisdiction (46 U.S.C. 740) (i.e. damage or injury on land resulting from an act on navigable waters). However, even in those cases, the filing of an administrative claim does not toll the two year statutory limit for filing suit nor extend the authority of the Army to settle a claim. Any such claim filed within six months of the running of the statute of limitations should be brought to the attention of USARCS immediately and every reasonable effort should be made to complete final agency action before the running of the two year limit. (f) Limitation of liability. Under the provisions of the Limitation of Shipowners' Liability Act, 46 U.S.C. 181&hyph;188, the United States may be able, in cases alleging injury or loss due to negligent operation of a vessel, to limit our liability to the value of the vessel after the accident. To take advantage of this law, the United States must file an action in federal district court within six months of receiving written notice of a claim. Therefore, USARCS must be notified within 10 workdays of the receipt of any maritime claim arising in the United States or on the high seas out of the operation of an Army vessel, to include pleasure craft owned by the United States. The Claims Service will coordinate with Litigation Division, OTJAG or the Chief Counsel, COE and the Department of Justice on whether a limitation of liability action will be filed. §536.128 Approval authority. (a) The Secretary of the Army, the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Financial Management) as designee of the Secretary or the designee of the Secretary may approve any settlement or compromise of a claim under this chapter subject only to the statutory limits (presently $500,000). (b) TJAG, TAJAG and the Commander, USARCS or his designee within USARCS are delegated authority to settle ( i.e. deny or approve payment in full or in part) any claim under this chapter regardless of the amount claimed, provided that any amount awarded does not exceed $100,000 and that the claimant signs an appropriate settlement agreement. (c) Chiefs of command claims services, heads of Corps of Engineers area claims offices and heads of other area claims offices designated by the Commander, USARCS, are delegated authority to deny claims under this chapter presented in an amount not exceeding $25,000. They may also pay in full or compromise any claim where the amount to be paid does not exceed $25,000, provided the claimant is willing to accept the payment and executes an appropriate settlement agreement. (d) Only the authorities designated in paragraph a, above may deny or make a final offer on a claim demanding more than $25,000. If a claim cannot be settled within the authority of the head of an area claims office or the chief of a command claims service responsible for investigating a claim, it will be forwarded to USARCS through appropriate channels with a claims memorandum of opinion recommending disposition. (e) Meritorious claims arising from civil works activities of the Corps of Engineers will be paid from Corps of Engineers funds.
