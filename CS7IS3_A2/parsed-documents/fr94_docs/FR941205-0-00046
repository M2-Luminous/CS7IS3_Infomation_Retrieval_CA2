ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This action amends the Aurora, Buckley Air National Guard (ANG) Base Airport, Colorado, Class D airspace, establishes Class E airspace, and incorporates part-time information to conform with the actual hours of operation at the Buckley ANG Base, Colorado. DATES: Effective date: 0701 u.t.c., February 28, 1995. Comment date: Comments must be received before February 1, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ted Melland, ANM&hyph;536, Federal Aviation Administration, Docket No. 94&hyph;ANM&hyph;55, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056, Telephone: (206) 227&hyph;2536. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History The FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) on June 3, 1993, to amend the Class D airspace for the Buckley ANG Base at Aurora, Colorado (58 FR 31486). Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments were received. On September 9, 1993, the FAA published a final rule amending Class D airspace (58 FR 47371). On June 20, 1994, the Federal Aviation Administration published another final rule which withdrew previous establishment of controlled airspace for the Buckley ANG Base, Aurora, Colorado, because commissioning of the airport had again been delayed (59 FR 31518). With the impending opening of a new International Airport at Denver, Colorado, there is a simultaneous requirement to amend the airspace adjacent to Class B airspace, including the Buckley ANG Base airspace. The coordinates are in North American Datum 83. Class D and Class E airspace designations are published in Paragraphs 5000, 6002, and 6004, respectively, of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class D and Class E airspace designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.
