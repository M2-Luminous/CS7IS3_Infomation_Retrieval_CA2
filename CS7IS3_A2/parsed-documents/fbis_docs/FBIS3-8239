Davies, former ambassador of the United States to Poland, recently sent an open letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton. In the letter, Davies requests intervention in the case of Colonel Ryszard Kuklinski. Davies suggests that Clinton bring up the issue of Kuklinski's rehabilitation during his visit to Poland, scheduled for July. "I hope that you might draw President Walesa's attention to the irony of the fact that the Pole, who before 1989 risked his life to help NATO, officially remains a traitor and is liable to imprisonment, whereas the leaders of today's Poland boast of its participation in NATO training and insist upon full membership in this organization," writes Davies. He emphasizes the "striking anomaly" that, in the case of the people who were sentenced earlier for treason, such as Spasowski, Rurarz, and Najder, the sentences were waived, but the charges against Kuklinski still stand. Davies recalls his earlier pleas defending the colonel, when he made an appeal published in THE WASHINGTON POST, and in letters to senators and congressmen, in which he suggested that Kuklinski's rehabilitation be the preliminary condition for Poland's admission to NATO. Kuklinski himself objected to such a proposal at that time; he claimed that he attaches greater importance to Poland's security, and, therefore, he would not like this issue to even slightly impede Polish efforts to become a member of the organization. "Now the situation has changed," notes Davies. Poland has joined the "Partnership for Peace," which is supposed to lead it to NATO. For this reason, the president of the United States, Poland's partner in this program, has a chance to repair the evil by "persistently insisting" that the same criteria applied in the cases of Spasowski, Rurarz, and Najder be applied to Kuklinski. However, the Office of the President of the Polish Republic states that each of the three ways to rehabilitate Colonel Kuklinski--extraordinary appeal, another trial, or an act of clemency by the president--requires that he take the first step; this is because--Davies quotes a letter from the Belweder--the public debate that took place in Poland in 1992 did not provide any final answer to the question of whether Kuklinski deserves to be called a contemporary Wallenrod [heroic character in Polish literature], or simply a foreign spy. Davies foresees two obstacles that Clinton may encounter in making an intervention in the case of Kuklinski. The president may decide that this problem is too minor to affect the good atmosphere of U.S.-Polish relations in any way; or he may decide that it is an internal Polish affair. However, due to what Kuklinski did for the West, NATO, the United States, and the freedom of his own country, he really deserves strong support of the United States, argues Davies. Apart from that, he is now a U.S. citizen and the U.S. authorities should be concerned about his good name.
