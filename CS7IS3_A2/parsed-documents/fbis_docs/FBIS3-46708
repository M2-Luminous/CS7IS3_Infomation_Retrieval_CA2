Under a draft of this plan, the six special cities under direct central government control will become ordinary cities. Pusan, Taegu, Inchon, Kwangju and Taejon will become local administrative units like other cities, but Seoul, with a population of more than 10 million, will be split into four cities as the government thinks that it has grown too large to administer effectively. Several cities and counties will be merged for more effective administration because, the ruling Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] says, the present system of stratified government is a legacy of the authoritarian past. Rep. Sin Sang-sik, chairman of the DLP ad hoc committee on political affairs, says that his committee is reviewing a plan to split Seoul into four cities. The opposition Democratic Party is opposed to the DLP's plan for Seoul's division, accusing the government party of resorting to redistricting because it is unsure of victory in the 1995 mayoral election, the first in many years. The opposition party objects less vociferously, however, to the plan to rezone cities and counties to create integrated urban-rural administrative units. Rapid urbanization has made it almost impossible in many places to draw a clear line between a rural and an urban area, and this warrants the creation of integrated urban-rural administrative units in some provinces. In South Kyongsang Province, for example, Sin says, Miryang City has a population of 70,000 and Miryang County a population of 50,000, and it is hard to tell the city administration from the county administration in this case. "It's nonsense to separate Miryang City from Miryang County and vice versa," he says. This also applies to Kimhae City and Kimhae County in the same province, according to Rep. Kim Yong-il, whose district it is. He says a merger of the county into the city is desirable for reduced administrative demands and for the convenience of the residents. Relatively large cities divided into wards (Ku) are not targeted for merger with counties in the DLP plan. They are Chonju, Ulsan, Puchon, Songnam, Suwon and Masan. Small cities such as Chechon, Sokcho, Tonghae and Osan are set for merger with adjacent counties. Farmers in counties that merge with cities will continue to receive government support, such as farming funds and scholarship funds for their children, under the DLP plan. The opposition party is giving an unfriendly look at the DLP's local administrative reform plan, calling it gerrymandering for victory in next year's local elections. In particular, it strongly opposes Seoul's division, considering it a plot to win the mayoral election.
