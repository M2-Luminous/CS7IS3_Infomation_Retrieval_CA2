FR940428-0-00027 FR940428-0-00010 Therefore, the Coast Guard's position is that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. If, however, you think that your business or organization qualifies as a small entity and that this rule will have a significant economic impact on your business or organization, please submit a comment (see ADDRESSES ) explaining why you think it qualifies and in what way and to what degree this rule will economically affect it. Collection of Information Under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. section 3501 et seq.), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reviews each rule that contains a collection-of-information requirement to determine whether the practical value of the information is worth the burden imposed by its collection. Collection-of-information requirements include recordkeeping, notification, and other, similar requirements. This rule contains collection of information requirements in the following section: Section 165.803(i). The following particulars apply: DOT No.: 2115. OMB Control No.: 2115&hyph;0092. Administration: U.S. Coast Guard. Title: Regulated Navigation Area; Mississippi River, Miles 88 to 240 Above Head of Passes. Need for Information: To ensure that the operators of barge fleeting facilities follow the proper mooring and inspection procedures, in order to prevent barges from breaking away from a fleeting facility and creating a hazard in a very congested area of the Mississippi River. Proposed Use of Information: To provide documentary evidence that inspections are being made and to aid in the investigation of any occurrences of barge fleet breakaways. Frequency of Response: Barge fleeting facilities must record: the time of commencement and termination of each inspection of barge moorings and the name of each person who does the inspection (twice daily); the date and time of each barge entering or leaving the facility; and the hazardous cargoes in them. Burden Estimate: Estimated burden is as follows: ␣ 1␣ 1Currently approved 1Requested Number of recordings per day 9.3 9.3 Estimated time per recording 5 minutes 5 minutes Number of days per year 365 days 365 days Average wage of inspectors $8 per hour $8 per hour Number of fleeting facilities 39 70 9.3 recordings per day×365 days×70 fleets×5 minutes per recording divided by 60 (minutes per hour) = 19801 hours. Annual total cost is $158,408. (Current approved burden is 11032 hours and annual total cost of $88,256.) Respondents: 70 barge fleeting operators in the regulated area. Form(s): None specified. Average Burden Hours per Respondent: 283 hours per respondent per year. This rule represents an increase of 8769 total hours in recordkeeping requirements. The Coast Guard is submitting the increased requirements to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). The section number is §165.803(i) and the current OMB control number is OMB Control Number 2115&hyph;0092. Persons submitting comments on the requirements should submit their comments both to OMB and to the Coast Guard where indicated under ADDRESSES . Federalism Assessment This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this proposed rule does not raise sufficient federalism concerns to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environmental Consideration This rule has been thoroughly reviewed by the Coast Guard, the lead Federal agency for purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). It has been determined not to have a significant effect on the human environment or environmental conditions and to be categorically excluded from further environmental documentation in accordance with section 2.B.2.c. of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B.
