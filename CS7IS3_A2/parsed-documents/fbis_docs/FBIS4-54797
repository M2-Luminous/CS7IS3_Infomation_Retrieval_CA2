All the senior officials are required to have a clean record regarding cooperation with the communist secret police (StB). "I am clean before myself," Magvasi told CTK, when asked about this. Asked whether the accusation stems from forces trying to "sidetrack" the SDL in Moravcik's cabinet, Magvasi replied: "Maybe." Magvasi said it was not accidental that his past is being questioned shortly after he "pointed to the schedule of the coupon privatization in Slovakia." He added that he did not question this privatization technique, but he just intended "that the citizen is not 'cheated' by the hectic and unprofessional pace." Premier Jozef Moravcik admitted there was tension between Magvasi (Democratic Left Party, SDL) and Privatization Minister Milan Janicina (National Democratic Party-New Alternative). Magvasi favors standard privatization techniques, while Janicina is considered to be an advocate of the former method. The first wave of privatization ended in January 1993. Ex-Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's government did not favor this method of privatization. The new government of Jozef Moravcik has said the second wave could be launched in the autumn.
