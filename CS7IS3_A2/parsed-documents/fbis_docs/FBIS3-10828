Members of the pro-Cuban Army of National Liberation (ELN) perpetrated the mass kidnapping. This action prevented the holding of elections in the small town of Carcasi. The rebels intercepted a bus and took seven members of the National Civil Registry Office, which organized the elections, and 25 students who were going to act as voting officers in that locality, to an unknown destination. During the past month, groups linked to the Simon Bolivar Guerrilla Coordinating Board (CGSB) intensified their attacks to sabotage the legislative elections, although the government said today those attempts failed. In addition to kidnapping electoral authorities, the CGSB also kidnapped three government officials in Cesar Department, blew up a stretch of the country's main oil pipeline, attacked intermunicipal buses, and activated medium-intensity bombs that did not cause any victims. Colombians renewed today 102 Senate seats and 163 in the Chamber of Representatives (deputies) and elected Ernesto Samper as presidential candidate for the Liberal Party, which used the opportunity to hold an internal "popular primary."
