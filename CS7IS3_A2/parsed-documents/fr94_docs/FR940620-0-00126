FR940620-0-00126 FR940620-0-00029 Comment. The NPRM asked whether the scoping provisions were appropriate and sought any information or survey results on the need for accessible units in existing residential facilities which are owned or operated by State or local governments, especially those that have complied with UFAS. Although a number of commenters supported the provision, many requested an increase in the percentages specified at ADAAG 13.3.2(1). The City of New York recommended 8.5 percent accessible dwelling units for New York based on recent census data. DREDF, Independent Housing Services of San Francisco, California, and others recommended ten percent accessible dwelling units under ADAAG 13.3.2(1). Conversely, a few commenters took the position that even five percent accessible dwelling units is too great a burden. The City of Boston, Public Facilities Department reported that where data are available, the demand has consistently been between two and three percent. They noted that accessible housing is not always occupied by people with disabilities and that the demand does not support the five percent requirement. On the other hand, a number of commenters suggested that a lack of outreach to people with disabilities was the reason for low occupancy rates of accessible units by persons with disabilities. With respect to ADAAG 13.3.2(2), the National Center for Law and Deafness pointed out that the two percent scoping for dwelling units accessible to persons with hearing impairments was less than the scoping for transient lodging. Response. The requirement for five percent accessible dwelling units, is consistent with the requirements of HUD's regulation implementing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 for multifamily facilities. Also, the legislative history of the ADA directs the Board not to set lesser accessibility requirements than those included in the Minimum Guidelines and Requirements for Accessible Design (MGRAD). H. Rept. 101&hyph;485, pt. 2, at 139. MGRAD requires five percent of the total number of units of a facility, or at least one dwelling unit, whichever is greater, to be accessible. See 36 CFR 1190.31(u)(2).
