FR940328-2-00050 FR940328-2-00029 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Workshop on the Role of Biomarkers in Field Studies of Environmentally-Associated Cancers; Meeting The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) in association with the University of South Florida, College of Public Health, announces the following meeting. Name : The Role of Biomarkers in Field Studies of Environmentally-Associated Cancers. Times and Dates : 8 a.m.&hyph;5:45 p.m., May 10, 1994. 8 a.m.&hyph;4:30 p.m., May 11, 1994. Place : Days Hotel at Lenox, 3377 Peachtree Road, NE, Atlanta, Georgia 30326. Status : Open to the public, limited only by the space available. The meeting room accommodates approximately 50 people. Purpose : This workshop is to assist ATSDR in developing standardized batteries of biomarkers which complement available clinical tests to identify cancers (of selected anatomic sites) and associated premalignant conditions, in environmental health field studies. Matters To Be Considered : Participants will be divided into the following three work groups: Work group 1: Cancers of Childhood. Work group 2: Cancers among Adults of Reproductive Age. Work group 3: Cancers among Older Adults. Each work group will prioritize and group anatomic sites for purposes of discussion. The following three topics will be discussed: (1) Currently-available biomarkers and other clinical tests to identify cancers and associated premalignant conditions. (2) Study design considerations for environmental health field studies: a. Population size and characteristics. b. Baseline ``core'' information (confounders). c. Time factors (cross-sectional, real time, latency). d. Disease-free persons who later are affected. (3) Long-term research issues. a. Periodicity of reexaminations. b. Specimen banking. c. Analyses performed with new tests at a later date. d. Ethics of consent, disclosure, interpretation. Contact Person for More Information : Joyce Smith, Division of Health Studies, ATSDR (MS E31), 1600 Clifton Road, NE., Atlanta, Georgia 30333, telephone 404/639&hyph;6200. Dated: March 22, 1994.
