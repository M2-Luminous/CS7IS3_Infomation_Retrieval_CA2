Since our June 8, 1994 preliminary determination (59 FR 30915, June 16, 1994), the following events have occurred. On May 11, and July 1, 1994, petitioner filed a case brief in this investigation. We received no requests for a hearing. Scope of Investigation The products covered by this investigation are certain cased pencils of any shape or dimension which are writing and/or drawing instruments that feature cores of graphite or other materials encased in wood and/or man-made materials, whether or not decorated and whether or not tipped ( e.g., with erasers, etc.) in any fashion, and either sharpened or unsharpened. The pencils subject to these investigations are classifiable under subheading 9609.10.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (``HTSUS''). Specifically excluded from the scope of this investigation are mechanical pencils, cosmetic pencils, pens, non-cased crayons (wax), pastels, charcoals, or chalks. Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive.
