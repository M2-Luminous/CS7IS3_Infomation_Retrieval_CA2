FBIS4-2499 "drchi070_r_94012" FBIS-CHI-94-070 Daily Report 10 Apr 1994 North Region Tianjin Construction Project in `Full Swing' Tianjin Construction Project in `Full Swing' OW1004045294 Beijing XINHUA in English 0154 GMT 10 Apr 94 OW1004045294 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Tianjin, April 10 (XINHUA) -- A housing construction project is now in full swing in north China's Tianjin city in an effort to let more low-income families move into better apartments and more than 750 households with housing difficulty have already moved into new homes since mid-March. According to an urban housing official, the city government earmarked 100 million yuan to build a number of living complexes last year. These houses were mainly sold at a price rate 30 percent lower than market prices to urban residents who have an average living space per capita of less than four square meters. As part of the project, the design of these apartment buildings stresses practical, multi-functional living facilities. This year, another three million square meters of such housing will be built in urban areas, the official said. Talking about the rebuilding and repair of old and dangerous houses, the official said, more than 83,000 homes in Tianjin have benefited from such projects since the year 1987. Together with the newly-built apartment houses, the city's average living space per capita now has jumped to 6.9 square meters from 3.3 square meters in 1978, although this is still much lower than the country's urban average. While focusing on expansion of average living space, the official said, the city also has made great efforts to improve the living environment. Every newly-built living complex or living quarters now is equipped with fine water, heat and electrical supply facilities, he said. Emphasis has also been placed on green land as part of housing planning. In one living complex with a population of 51,000 residents, for example, the average per capita area of green space reaches 1.76 square meters. "We cannot let the common residents March into the 21st century in shabby and dangerous homes," said city Mayor Zhang Lichang. Following the countrywide campaign to improve the living conditions of low income families, the municipal government also framed a better-off-housing program last year. It planned to spend three years or more to build more than 10 million square meters of apartment houses equipped with advanced living facilities. And within the coming five or seven years, nearly 10 million square meters of dangerous and shabby housing in the downtown area will be replaced by new houses and new financial and business centers. At the same time, about 25 million square meters of new housing would be added, and the average living space would reach eight square meters, the urban housing official said. The program has started to take effect. The design work of four living complexes has already been completed and ground has been broken for the construction of 1.65 million square meters of housing this year. According to the official, an estimated investment in the better-off-housing project totals about 15 billion yuan. To attract more funds, both domestic and overseas, the city government will improve the management of land for housing construction. And the building materials will be supplied at government-set prices. The same preferential policies will be offered to overseas investors, according to the official. In 1993, overseas investment in housing construction reached 700 million U.S. dollars. And the amount the city received in the first two months this year topped 500 million U.S. dollars. According to an urban construction planning official, the better-off project is a comprehensive one involving the residents' views on living style, their real income and many other management problems of urban development. And Tianjin is ready to take measures to reform the current housing system and further expand the real estate market in order to quicken the pace of the housing drive.
