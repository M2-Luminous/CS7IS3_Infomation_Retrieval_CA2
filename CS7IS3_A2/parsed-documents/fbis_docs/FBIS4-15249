First Vice Premier Works as Usual"] [Text] Responding to accusations that First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets had unlawfully bought shares in the Novosibirsk tin combine, members of his staff stated yesterday that there is no documentary evidence of the charges. In the meantime some versions of the appearance of the scandalous information have been put forward in government circles. The crux of SEGODNYA's charge against Oleg Soskovets is that he allegedly bought shares in the Novosibirsk tin combine which are distributed through private subscription. Not being a member of the work collective, the vice premier had no right to make such a purchase. Yesterday, members of the first vice premier's staff stated to a SEGODNYA correspondent that there is no documentary confirmation of the fact that shares were bought and that Oleg Soskovets has absolutely nothing to do with this affair. According to the vice premier's aides, he reacted quite calmly to the publication and continues to work "as usual." From the cautious remarks by members of the government apparatus, one can put together two versions of the appearance of the publication against the vice premier. The first is that the publication had been inspired by a side that had suffered in some scandal between the tin combine's shareholders. Some staffers of the Russian Federation Metallurgy Committee cashed in on this dissatisfaction in order to take vengeance on their former chief. The second version has to do with the struggle between various conceptions of the post-voucher privatization in Russia. In this case, charges against Soskovets, according to a theory, have primarily a political-economic meaning: They are aimed at weakening the first deputy premier's influence in the final stage of check privatization and at decreasing his activism in working out strategy of the next stage. By the way, the Magnitogorsk metallurgical combine is supposed to become a proving ground for privatization methods not controlled by Anatoliy Chubays.
