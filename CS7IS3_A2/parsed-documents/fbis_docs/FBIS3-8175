On 24 February, during an official visit to Latvia, President Lech Walesa said that the excessive concentration of Russian troops in the Kaliningrad district was not beneficial to security in the Baltic region. [Reporter] The Kaliningrad district belongs to Russia, and everything that happens there is an internal matter for the Russian Federation, said Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Krylov, commenting on Lech Walesa's statement. The spokesman of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Mikhail Demurin, added that Russia had the right to keep within the Kaliningrad district as many troops as was necessary to ensure security. According to Deputy Minister Krylov, President Walesa is well aware that many Russian soldiers are in the district temporarily. This situation arose when troops were withdrawn from the Baltic countries, and it was impossible to relocate them in other regions of the country. The Russian diplomat believes that by his statement Lech Walesa wanted to please the Latvians. According to experts, there are at present 150,000-200,000 Russian soldiers stationed in the Kaliningrad district.
