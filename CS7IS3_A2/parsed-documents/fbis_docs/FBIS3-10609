This statement by Reyes Calderon came one day after a government press communique quoted him delivering a strong warning to potential riot instigators, who reportedly have been acting within the framework of the state employees' strike movement. This statement also came at a time when the Army controls the town of Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa, the site of violent riots on Tuesday, when the local police station was set on fire and many policemen were attacked. The incidents resulted from speculation by the townspeople about a possible plot between policemen and members of a band of traffickers of children, to which Melissa Carol Larson, a North American, allegedly belongs. Yesterday Larson was in danger of being lynched. Today, Reyes Calderon talked about the measures that could be adopted, in conjunction with the Attorney General's Office, to check threats to national stability. [Begin recording] [Reyes Calderon] Highway Patrol cars and other state vehicles have been used. Some people have used state gasoline also and are not going to their jobs. They are [word indistinct]. For this reason, today, in compliance with the law, two pilots were arrested for misusing state funds. The attorney general was with us to see that the prosecutors take action in the upcoming trials. [Unidentified reporter] [question indistinct] [Reyes Calderon] No. I did not say that. Right now, six people are officially under arrest. They were arrested in Quezaltenango. Others are also under arrest. Late in the afternoon, a communique will be issued to report on all the people who were arrested. I have confirmation that six people were arrested but I have been informed that another 11 people were arrested in other places. [Reporter] Where is the North American woman being held? [Reyes Calderon] She is under arrest in Esquintla. Today, she will be transferred to Santa Teresa in Zone 18. [Reporter] [words indistinct] the participation of the police? [Reyes Calderon] This is a charge that was filed recently. The Professional Responsibilities Office [Oficina de Responsabilidad Profesional -- ORP] is investigating. I was telling your fellow journalists a while ago that the administration of Ramiro de Leon Carpio is trying 210 agents for various crimes. If anyone is involved, we will act drastically and prosecute them in the courts. [Reporter] It has been said that these people are trafficking human organs. [Reyes Calderon] This is speculation. What happened is that there were two children in the morgue, and somebody spread the rumor and that is why the townspeople were enraged. There is no confirmed case of trafficking human organs in Guatemala. [Reporter] [question indistinct] [Reyes Calderon] According to Police Report 54. [Reporter] [question indistinct] [Reyes Calderon] Nine people were injured: four citizens and five policemen. [Reporter] [question indistinct] [Reyes Calderon] Yes, of course, with reinforcements. As you know, yesterday, the Army supported us, and this helped restore order. [Reporter] What kind of sabotage was done yesterday and what kind of sabotage [words indistinct]? [Reyes Calderon] Public buildings were seized; people were prevented from exercising their right to move around freely; border posts were closed; and public institutions were seized. [Reporter] The Governor's Office was seized and the roads in and out of Zacapa were blocked. Did you send riot police? [Reyes Calderon] We sent a police contingent. That is why the attorney general came. We discussed all the issues because some people are blocking the road to Agua Caliente. Honest people, businessmen, and people wanting to engage in commercial activities cannot work because people are blocking the road. We are going to respect human rights and ask them to leave but if they insist on blocking traffic, we will act firmly, as the law demands. [end recording] Attorney General Telesforo Guerra Cahn met with the acting government minister to coordinate preventive actions in case of other riots. Guerra Cahn spoke about this matter following a meeting with acting Government Minister Reyes Calderon. [Begin recording] [Guerra] Yesterday, we agreed with the government minister that his office would coordinate actions with the Attorney General's Office to avoid the public-disorder situations that are arising throughout the country. We as authorities cannot permit groups to act as they did in [words indistinct]. [Reporter] What measures will be adopted? [Guerra] Preventive measures [words indistinct] and the Attorney General's Office will also participate. We will take legal actions against those who are arrested. [Words indistinct] investigate charges that the North American woman is involved in the trafficking of children because the neighbors have charged that there is trafficking in children's organs. I do not want to speculate. Sometimes situations of conflict are created. I understand the woman is being held in the Esquintla women's prison. She cannot be released without a judge's order. Regarding your second question, we have no information that she is involved in any such activity. This was speculation yesterday and that is what causes mobs to carry out actions of violence. [words indistinct] set state property, including a police station, on fire, acted disorderly, carried out demonstrations, injured and pressured people. Some criminal activities were carried out. The judge must decide on this, but we are beginning procedures and our prosecutors have been brought [words indistinct]. Approximately 52 people are under arrest. [end recording]
