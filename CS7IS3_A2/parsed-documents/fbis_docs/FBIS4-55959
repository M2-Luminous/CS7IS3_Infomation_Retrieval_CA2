He spoke about the coming Geneva negotiations between our delegation and the contact group. Izetbegovic said: We hesitated over whether to go to the talks. There were different stands on this issue. We concluded that the reasons for [words indistinct] prevailed. These are not real negotiations, and our delegation (?sees them) only as an opportunity to inform about the true state of affairs before the 30 May session of the Assembly of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We have had indications that certain favorable changes have been made in the contact group, and we will try to exert influence on the contact group's stands. Public opinion in France and the United States seems to go in the direction which could exert influence on certain stands being changed to comply with our wishes. Asked what he thought about the return to the negotiations of Lord David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, President Izetbegovic said: Our great reservations about their involvement in the negotiating process are very well justified. It is well known that they have brought no good to us. They advocated stands which were against the interests of Bosnia-Herzegovina and, unfortunately, they were successful in doing that, so that it was difficult (?to play that game) with them. I think that our delegation at the meeting will speak out against the talks. We sent a letter demanding Yasushi Akashi's resignation. We refused to receive him on several occasions. I do not know how much they respect our opinion, and whether they believe they should act in line with our wishes. Among other things, President Izetbegovic said the following about a possible denouement in the military and political spheres: Unfortunately, I cannot say that I expect a great deal because I have been frustrated by the failure of negotiations so far. I can say in particular that I do not expect much because the contact group is again repeating the percentage of 51 [for the Croats and Muslims] to 49 [for the Serbs], and we will see whether they have changed their position on this. We cannot [words indistinct] our occupied territories. The pressure exerted on us to accept the proposed 51-49 percentage could be (?seen) as the continuation of war, but not though our fault, but through the fault of those who have not given us choice. We keep repeating that we are in favor of a just peace. What is being offered to us is not just peace, unless considerable changes are made in future talks. Regardless of what the world wants, it is, objectively speaking, pushing us toward war. They have not offered us any alternative. We have already defined our aims on the lower limit of a bearable minimum, but further concessions have been demanded of us. I believe that we can make no more concessions, President of the Presidency Alija Izetbegovic said among other things in an interview for Bosnia-Herzegovina television.
