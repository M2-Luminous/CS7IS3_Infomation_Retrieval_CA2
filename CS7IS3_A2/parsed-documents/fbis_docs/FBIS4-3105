In the city's orphanages are living some 350 disabled children who were abandoned by their parents because they suffered from congenital or post-natal diseases, such as heart disease or mental or physical handicaps. Aiming to give these children the chance to enjoy family happiness, various city government departments, including civil affairs administration, women's federation and children's welfare society, are working together for residents to adopt or give financial aid to these unfortunate kids. The children can be expected to grow more healthily if they receive better family warmth, care, entertainment, medical care and education. So far, more than 40 orphans have been adopted or are receiving help.
