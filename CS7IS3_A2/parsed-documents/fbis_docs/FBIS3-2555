Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong Branch, made these remarks at a public occasion held here on Tuesday [8 March] night in response to the Hong Kong Government's decision to table the remaining part of its political reform bill to the Legislative Council. Zhang said that the Chinese side had always wanted to cooperate with the British side over the Hong Kong issue, but the British side did not want that cooperation. The unilateral action taken by the British side last December to table the first part of Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's Political Reform Bill to the Legislative Council regardless of the repeated admonitions by the Chinese side had already signaled that they had not really wanted the talks, said Zhang. "In fact, there is lack of sincerity on the part of the British side from the very beginning of the Sino-British talks," he said. Zhang listed a number of facts to support his argument. In view of the records of the British side for not being able to abide by agreements, he said that the Chinese side had insisted that certain principles of the talks must be set up before the two sides began to talk. But the British side refused to do so, he said, adding that the Chinese side later made concessions over the issue so that the talks could proceed. However, said Zhang, during the talks the British side had put forward a number of unreasonable demands including things amounting to interference in the sovereign rights of China and affairs that should be handled by the future government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. In order to break the deadlock of the talks and achieve an agreement, Zhang went on, the Chinese side later proposed to solve the easier problems regarding the 1994-95 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong first before more difficult ones were touched upon. At first, the British side objected to the proposal, said Zhang. The two sides were not able to sit down to talk until the Chinese side had accepted a number of preconditions put forward by the British side, he added. However, Zhang said, when the two sides were almost to reach an agreement, the British side suddenly decided to withdraw from the talks by finding some flimsy excuses. Now it is very clear that the Chinese side has made its utmost efforts in the Sino-British talks over the Hong Kong issue, said Zhang, adding that it is the British side that has sabotaged the talks and cooperation between the two sides.
