He was against the situation where, as he puts it, the defense units of two countries are stationed on its soil. Meshkov said that he did not press for the independence of Crimea. He explained that he wanted the Crimean republic to be autonomous in resolving economic issues. According to the president, 1,081,000 out of the 1,087,000 eligible voters responded to the March 27 poll. Treaty relations between the Crimea and Ukraine were supported by 78.4 percent, dual Crimean-Russian and Crimean-Ukrainian citizenship by 82.8 percent, and making the Crimean president's decrees binding on issues not yet covered by the Crimean legislation, by 77.9 percent. Meshkov said that the elections of the Crimean parliament "bore out the results of the presidential elections and showed that the Crimean population supported the platform of the Russia bloc." He described as clumsy the allegations of certain politicians that ethnic Russians alone had voted in the elections.
