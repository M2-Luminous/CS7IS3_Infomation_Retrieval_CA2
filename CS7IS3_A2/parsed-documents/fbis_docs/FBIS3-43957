Last Friday Mr. Dhlakama met the UN special envoy to Mozambique, Mr. Aldo Ajello, about raising funds to help Renamo to transform itself into a political party. Mr. Ajello said although he had appealed to the international community for support there had been little response beyond the 6 million dollars pledged by Italy early last year. Mr. Dhlakama said the international community promised him millions of dollars before he signed the Mozambican Peace Accord and that continued peace depended on having sufficient funds.
