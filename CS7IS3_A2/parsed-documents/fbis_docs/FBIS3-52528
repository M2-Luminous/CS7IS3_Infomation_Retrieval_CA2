"The two sides are expected at the end of the week to announce the resumption of the Taba negotiations on the basis of the document drawn up last Wednesday in Cairo," he said. "But the Palestinians will be able to rediscuss the points which they judge contentious," the negotiator told AFP, asking not to be named. The compromise allows both sides to argue that they stood their ground on a draft document which Israel leaked after negotiations last week in the Egyptian capital. Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation have fought a battle of words over their different interpretations of the last round of negotiations, but have been holding intensive consultations in private. "The PLO offered us a dozen compromise formulas before giving one that satisfied us," the negotiator said. [passage omitted]
