FBIS4-29220 "dreas116_a_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-116 Daily Report 16 Jun 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Reports on U.S.-Japan Semiconoductor Talks Reports on U.S.-Japan Semiconoductor Talks Further on Extension Issue OW1606111794 Tokyo KYODO in English 1110 GMT 16 Jun 94 OW1606111794 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- Japan and the United States on Thursday [16 June] evaluated foreign access to Japan's semiconductor market but avoided discussing whether or not to end a bilateral chip trade pact before the July 1996 expiration, a Japanese Trade Ministry official said. During regular chip trade talks in Tokyo, both parties instead agreed to review the "appropriateness" of an earlier termination to the pact by the end of July this year, the Japanese official told a press conference. The U.S. "has made clear it has no interest" in an early termination, a U.S. official told reporters. "It is important to see the agreement will run its full course." Japan's stance on the issue has yet to be decided, the Japanese official said. The July 1991 bilateral chip trade accord calls for Japan to maintain a "gradual and steady" increase in the foreign chip share of the Japanese market above the 20 percent level. Under the pact, both parties are required to decide at the end of July this year whether or not to end it before the 1996 expiration. The two-day session, the second of its kind this year following the Hawaii gathering in March, came after Tuesday's announcement that foreign-made semiconductor chips continued to seize more than 20 percent of the Japanese market in the January-March quarter. The latest meeting assessed the first-quarter foreign chip share, the recent increase in foreign chip sales in Japan and implementation of "design-in" joint cooperation programs for making chips from the development stage, the Japanese official said. Washington appreciates the latest foreign chip share, the U.S. Official said. The Japanese side sought further marketing efforts from U.S. Chip makers, including securing a stable product supply, the Japanese official said, noting some types of foreign chips are in short supply in Japan.
