FR941028-2-00068 FR941028-2-00050 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CRADA NIO&hyph;95&hyph;001] National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health; Cooperative Research and Development Agreement AGENCY: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Public Health Service, HHS. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), announces the opportunity for potential collaborators to enter into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to develop a system or systems to automate sampling method development and analysis for airborne contaminants. It is anticipated that all inventions which may arise from this CRADA will be jointly owned. The collaborator(s) with whom the CRADA is made will have an option to negotiate an exclusive or non-exclusive royalty-bearing license. The CRADA will be executed for a 2-year period with the possibility of renewal for another 2-year period. Because CRADAs are designed to facilitate the development of scientific and technological knowledge into useful, marketable products, a great deal of freedom is given to Federal agencies in implementing collaborative research. The CDC may accept staff, facilities, equipment, supplies, and money from the other participants in a CRADA; CDC may provide staff, facilities, equipment, and supplies to the project. There is a single restriction in this exchange: CDC MAY NOT PROVIDE FUNDS to the other participants in a CRADA. This opportunity is available until 30 days after publication of this notice. Respondents may be provided a longer period of time to furnish additional information if CDC finds this necessary. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Technical: Eugene R. Kennedy, Ph.D., Methods Development Section 2, Methods Research Branch, Division of Physical Sciences and Engineering, NIOSH, CDC, 4676 Columbia Parkway, Mailstop R&hyph;7, Cincinnati, Ohio 45226, telephone, (513) 841&hyph;4392, FAX (513) 841&hyph;4500. Business: Theodore F. Schoenborn, Technology Transfer Coordinator, NIOSH, CDC, 4676 Columbia Parkway, Mailstop R&hyph;2, Cincinnati, Ohio 45226, telephone, (513) 841&hyph;4305, FAX (513) 841&hyph;4500. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The system or systems to be developed will combine laboratory automation, with novel sampler designs and analytical methodology to provide for an automated approach to method development and evaluation. The collaborator(s) and NIOSH will jointly perform the research aimed at development of a commercial system to provide convenient sampling and analytical methods for airborne contaminants. NIOSH will provide technical expertise, consultation and guidance, verification of system integrity, and product evaluation and testing. Since this CRADA involves the bringing together of diverse technologies, a consortium of collaborators will be considered. Applicants will be judged according to the following criteria: 1. Adequacy and technical capabilities to develop the desired technologies and product; 2. Ability to develop, produce, market, and support system(s); 3. Evidence of technical credibility; and 4. Ability to complete the CRADA in a timely fashion. This CRADA is proposed and implemented under the 1986 Federal Technology Transfer Act: Public Law 99&hyph;502. The responses must be made to: Theodore F. Schoenborn, Technology Transfer Coordinator, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, CDC, 4676 Columbia Parkway, Mailstop R&hyph;2, Cincinnati, Ohio 45226. Dated: October 24, 1994. Richard A. Lemen, Acting Director, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
