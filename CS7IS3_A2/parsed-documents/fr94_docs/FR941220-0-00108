FR941220-0-00108 FR941220-0-00014 (ii) Deduction which is authorized by a collective bargaining agreement, or is reasonable and customary in the occupation and/or area of employment (e.g., union dues; contribution to premium for health insurance policy covering all employees; savings or retirement fund contribution for plan(s) in compliance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, 29 U.S.C. 1001, et seq. ), except that the deduction may not recoup a business expense(s) of the employer; the deduction must have been revealed to the worker prior to the commencement of employment and, if the deduction was a condition of employment, had been clearly identified as such; and the deduction must be made against wages of U.S. workers as well as H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants (where there are U.S. workers); or (iii) Deduction which meets the following requirements: (A) Is made in accordance with a voluntary, written authorization by the employee (Note: an employee's mere acceptance of a job which carries a deduction as a condition of employment does not constitute voluntary authorization, even if such condition were stated in writing); (B) Is for a matter principally for the benefit of the employee (Note: housing and food allowances would be considered to meet this ``benefit of employee'' standard, unless the employee is in travel/per diem status, or unless the circumstances indicate that the arrangements for the employee's housing or food are principally for the convenience or benefit of the employer ( e.g., employee living at worksite in ``on call'' status)); (C) Is not a recoupment of the employer's business expense ( e.g., tools and equipment; transportation costs where such transportation is an incident of and necessary to the employment; living expenses when the employee is traveling on the employer's business) (for purposes of this section, initial transportation from and end-of-employment travel to the worker's home country shall not be considered a business expense); (D) Is an amount that does not exceed the fair market value or the actual cost (whichever is lower) of the matter covered (Note: the employer must document the cost and value); and (E) Is an amount that does not exceed the limits set for garnishment of wages in the Consumer Credit Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. 1673, and the regulations of the Secretary pursuant to that Act, 29 CFR part 870, under which garnishment(s) may not exceed 25% of an employee's disposable earnings for a workweek. (8) Any unauthorized deduction taken from wages is considered by the Department to be non-payment of that amount of wages, and, in the event of an investigation, will result in back wage assessment (plus civil money penalties and/or disqualification from H&hyph;1B and other immigration programs (pursuant to ยง XXXX .810(b)), if willful). (9) Where the employer depresses the employee's wages below the required wage by imposing on the employee any of the employer's business expense(s), the Department will consider the amount to be an unauthorized deduction from wages even if the matter is not shown in the employer's payroll records as a deduction. (10) Where the employer makes deduction(s) for repayment of loan(s) or wage advance(s) made to the employee, the Department, in the event of an investigation, will require the employer to establish the legitimacy and purpose(s) of the loan(s) or wage advance(s), with reference to the standards set out in paragraph (c)(7) of this section. (d) Enforcement actions. (1) In the event that a complaint is filed pursuant to subpart I of this part, alleging a failure to meet the ``prevailing wage'' condition or a material misrepresentation by the employer regarding the payment of the required wage, or pursuant to such other basis for investigation as the Administrator may find, the Administrator shall determine whether the employer has the documentation required in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and whether the documentation supports the employer's wage attestation. Where the documentation is either nonexistent or is insufficient to determine the prevailing wage ( e.g., does not meet the criteria specified in this section, in which case the Administrator may find a violation of paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3), of this section); or where, based on significant evidence regarding wages paid for the occupation in the area of intended employment, the Administrator has reason to believe that the prevailing wage finding obtained from an independent authoritative source or another legitimate source varies substantially from the wage prevailing for the occupation in the area of intended employment; or where the employer has been unable to demonstrate that the prevailing wage determined by another legitimate source is in accordance with the regulatory criteria, the Administrator may contact ETA, which shall provide the Administrator with a prevailing wage determination, which the Administrator shall use as the basis for determining violations and for computing back wages, if such wages are found to be owed. The 30-day investigatory period shall be suspended while ETA makes the prevailing wage determination and, in the event that the employer timely challenges the determination through the Employment service complaint system (see ยง XXXX .731(d)(2) of this part), shall be suspended until the Employment Service complaint system process is completed and the Administrator's investigation can be resumed.
