Bosnian Serb Vice-President Nikola Koljevic told reporters after the first round of talks at Sarajevo Airport that the document regulated all power disruptions in territories controlled by all three sides. The talks at Sarajevo Airport are part of an effort to rebuild confidence among Bosnia's warring nations. No agreement has been reached on another major issue -- the release of five Serb doctors and three nurses arrested by the Moslems in Sarajevo last week in an alleged attempt to flee a Moslem-controlled quarter of the city. "This issue should demonstrate the good will of the (Moslem) side, and we regret to say that we shall be unable to accept any agreement until this major issue has been resolved," said Koljevic. General Milan Gvero, assistant commander of the Bosnian Serb Army, said the Moslem military authorities had been asked to publicly withdraw their declaration of war on the Serbs in these lands and to clearly call off all military operations, as insistence on confidence-building is senseless if combat operations continue.
