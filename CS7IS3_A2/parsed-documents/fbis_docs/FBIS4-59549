How true are these reports? How do you assess the situation on the ground? [Al-Dali] It has become clear that Sanaa has been transmitting lies since the very first day these battles began. You followed with me the news that Sanaa has been transmitting over the past 10 days, that they are 3 km away, 6 km, and 10 km, then they went back and said 20 km. The truth is that these are all lies by which they seek to boost their morale in order to prevent popular upheaval in wake of the big defeats they have sustained over the last 10 days. Now, fighting is raging on the borders between the former two parts of the homeland. The situation is very good in Abyan, and also [word indistinct] in al-Dali.' [Salamah] Have you recaptured al-Dali' city? [Al-Dali] Yes, yes. We recaptured it yesterday and [words indistinct] settled in our favor, and the al-'Amaliqah elements are being liquidated. They have entered houses, (?plundered] villages and valleys [indisdtinct word] in Abyan. [Salamah] The central command in Sanaa seems to be set on a military solution and seeks, as it says, to arrest the leaders of the south, after describing them as the advocates of apostasy and secession, with Vice Chairman 'Ali Salim al-Bid at their head. Do you believe it is still possible to resort to dialogue to find a political solution to the conflict in Yemen? [Al-Dali] I say that political dialogue is a sine qua non, no matter how intense the fighting becomes. In the end, there will be no other choice but to hold a dialogue. The military settlement about which they have spoken so much has reached a dead end. There is no other course open to them but to [words indisintct] and sit around the table so we may talk and hold consultations. [Salamah] The YSP has addressed urgent calls to the Arab League to have it immediately intervene to stop the battles. The Arab League delegation to Yemen still waits in Sanaa without any result. The delegation still waits to meet [words indistinct]. On your part, do you still hope for the success of the Arab efforts to stop the fighting? [Al-Dali] The truth is that the parliamentary bloc within the YSP is the one that addressed an urgent call to the Arab League to stop this massacre Sanaa's soldiers are determined to carry out. Yes, we still call for stopping the fighting and the bloodshed, in spite of everything. We, the Yemenis, do not have any other course but to sit together after stopping the fighting and to hold a dialogue. We give the Arab League an important role. We hope that it succeeds in its endeavor. [Salamah] Many Arab countries, especially Syria, as well as the Arab League, today made a new appeal to the friends in Yemen to halt the battles and implement the pledge and accord document. This is what the United States also did yesterday. Do you believe this document is still suitable and can be implemented after all what has happened? Will the Yemeni leaders respond to the calls of the fraternal and friendly countries? [Al-Dali] I believe that if the fighting halts, the document can be discussed because it is still vital. [Salamah] What new element can make Yemeni leaders implement this document, which was signed in Amman a long time ago? [Al-Dali] I said we hope the other party will also be ready to implement and apply the document. But if they do not want to, as they did in the past, if they reject the document, or if they are unable to implement it, then that is another question. The document cannot be applied by one party. The document should be applied by all parties involved. For our part in the YSP, we still believe the document can be applied and can be dealt with. But, if the other party does not want to, then this is another question and it will be difficult and even impossible to implement the document. [Salamah] Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, in light of the facts in the field and the adopted positions, it is regrettably clear that the military option still overwhelms other options. The contradiction has assumed a conflicting nature, and it may not be decided in light of current factors unless there is a victor and a vanquished in Yemen. Do you believe that there is still a chance of dealing with the conflict politically? [Al-Dali] I believe that despite all that has taken place, we can deal with the issue politically. We always prefer the political option, to which we should resort in the final analysis, when all the other options, including the military one, fail -- a military option adopted by Sanaa. We have not resorted to the military option. We have opted for the political solution. We believe that after the military option fails, Sanaa will inevitably return to the political option. [Salamah] Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, the human and the material losses are huge. How long will the fighting in Yemen continue, in your opinion? [Al-Dali) We will continue it until the last man. We will not allow the imposition of any solution by force. We will not allow any one to enslave us in this way Sanaa (?ruler) wants. [Salamah] Thank you Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali for your interview with Paris Radio Monte Carlo.
