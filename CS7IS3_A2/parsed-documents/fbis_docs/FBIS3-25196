Outside the hall Azapo [Azanian People's Organization] supporters shouted slogans and displayed placards that made no bones about their feeling for Mr. Meyer. During his speech, which was interrupted continually by hecklers and supporters, Mr. Meyer referred to the Freedom Alliance's [FA] refusal to compromise at talks with the government and the ANC. He said that if the FA decided to boycott the election, other parties would look after the interests of its supporters. [Begin Meyer recording] Those parties in the Freedom Alliance are not going to participate in the election. Then we can ensure their supporters also from the National Party side that we will also take care of their interests. [end recording]
