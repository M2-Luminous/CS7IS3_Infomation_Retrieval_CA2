"Reconciliation dialogue" was the best way to ensure the withdrawal of Serb heavy weapons from around Sarajevo in an effort to end the siege of the city, Gonzalez said after talks with visiting Hungarian President Arpad Goncz. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has threatened to launch air strikes against the Serbs' positions around Sarajevo if they fail to withdraw their heavy weapons from around the city by midnight GMT on Sunday [20 February]. The Hungarian president shared the view of Gonzalez. He told reporters upon arrival here that "every effort should be exerted to defuse the crisis without resorting to air strikes." Also today, Spanish Defense Minister Julian Garcia Vargas said Spain favored diplomatic efforts to end the siege of Sarajevo, instead of the use of force as proposed by NATO. He was speaking after returning from France where he had consulted with French officials on the Bosnian crisis. The Bosnian Serbs have been under mounting international pressure to withdraw their heavy artillery from around Sarajevo since a mortar attack killed 68 civilians and wounded nearly 200 others in the city earlier this month. The Muslims accused the Serbs of launching the attack, a charge the Serbs denied.
