Its future will depend on whose capital it will manage to attract. The largest independent radio station already boasts an audience of 4 million listeners or so. In Moscow and Moscow Oblast, where "Ekho" is on the air, it has already presented serious competition for "Radio Rossii" and "Mayak." By the end of 1993, however, it became obvious that "Ekho's" financial position does not look as bright as its approval rating. Wear and tear on its equipment has begun affecting the quality of broadcasting. Meager salaries by comparison with, say, music radio stations, force journalists to look for extra income or to go into business. If "Ekho Moskvy" is to survive, it has no other choice but to attract outside capital. There have been so far two candidates courting this "bride" -- the "Most" financial group and Weigel Broadcasting, an American company. In the past six months the "Most" group under Vladimir Gusinskiy proved to be an aggressive buyer on the mass media market. At present, it controls the SEGODNYA newspaper and the fourth television channel. What it lacks to have a complete spectrum is a popular radio station. "Most's" offer to "Ekho" looks as follows: an open credit line in exchange for 51 percent of the radio station's stock. This means that the station risks losing political, not only financial, independence. Weigel Broadcasting is not a newcomer on the broadcasting market: After 25 years in business it owns eight television stations in the United States. According to the company's spokesmen, they are interested in "Ekho's" independence, because in the end it earns a good income. Weigel Broadcasting is ready to invest money not only in equipment: the 50 percent of stock it expects to get in exchange for its services opens up a way toward compromise-based management. There is no unity inside "Ekho Moskvy" as to whose proposal it should accept. Editor-in-chief Sergey Korzun and journalists are inclined to forge a partnership with Weigel Broadcasting. Proposals by the "Most" group appear enticing to Yuriy Fedutinov, the station's commercial director. The fate of "Ekho Moskvy" will apparently be decided in mid-January at a general meeting of stockholders.
