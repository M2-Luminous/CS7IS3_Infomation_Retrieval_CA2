The free man views his freedom as a natural part of his life and does not find amazement in it or weep for joy; it does not enter his mind that it might be a great blessing sent from God the Almighty. Once freedom was a blessing, and, since mankind descended to earth with Adam and Eve, they have striven for this sacred blessing; all struggles in world history have been to attain this blessing or in order not to lose it. If the state is free -- this is a blessing; if the nation is free and each member of the nation is free -- this is a blessing. If, when a man enters his home and talks with those near to him and does not lower his voice, does not think of listening devices -- this is a blessing. If "security officials" do not threaten him, if they do not throw him into a car and then beat him mercilessly, if they do not throw him into prison -- this is a blessing. Every thinking person in all of Uzbekistan wants normal blessings like these. When they write our government, it is not always about "bread and meat alone," but also they also express the wish for normal human rights. Certainly man needs meat, bread, and rice. The government of Uzbekistan has promised these blessings over the last four years. For four years this government has said " we are putting the economy ahead of politics because first we have to fill the people's stomach," but the people's stomach are still not full; on the contrary, the people sink further into poverty every day. Because an economy that is not free can never fill the people's stomach -- freedom is also necessary to the economy. Today, every social stratum in Uzbekistan understands this truth. Approximately two years ago the urban population which was living rather well -- intellectuals, civil servants, and workers, began to view with doubt todays' "precedence of economics over politics." Even some government organs and some members of the government began to understand this truth. As a result of this mistaken policy Uzbekistan's standard of living has dropped to one of the lowest in the world: the republic has not moved forward, it has fallen ten years behind. Who will answer for this? The majority say, "the present government has to answer for this." True, the day for an answer has come, but this "answer" can never make up for the time that has been lost. We need the answer not in the "future," but now. This government, undoubtedly, will go down as one of the worst in our history, and there are many who want an answer to this question. But the answer must not come from some low-level bureaucrat, but from the tyrant now sitting on the throne. ERK newspaper has once again come forward to ask for an answer. May your eyes be clear, yearners for freedom!
