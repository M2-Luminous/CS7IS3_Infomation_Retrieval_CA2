FR941216-1-00147 FR941216-1-00012 (a) Ammunition shall not be placed in any gun until it is in firing position and ready to shoot. (b) Safety devices on gun mounts and ranges shall be kept in operating condition and tested before use. If a malfunction occurs, test operations shall cease and a report made to the responsible supervisors. (c) Every weapon removed from a firing position, storage case, or rack; or picked up by any operator, shall be inspected for the presence of ammunition in the chamber, magazine, or feed mechanism, and for obstruction in the bore. (d) The chamber, magazine, and feed mechanism of all guns should be open during handling and transportation. When practicable, a safety block should be used in the chambers of weapons. (e) Primers of misfired rounds may be hypersensitive; precautions should be taken during their removal from the gun, handling, and disposal. (f) Firing on ballistic ranges, expect in function and casualty tests, shall be from fixed rests. (g) When sand butts are used to stop bullets, a reinforced concrete wall should be constructed at sufficient distance behind the retaining wall to permit inspection. This is necessary because bullets tend to tunnel through the sand and penetrate the retaining wall after continued firing. To discover any such penetration, the inner face of the second wall should be inspected frequently. If terrain effectively protects the rear of the range, no concrete wall is necessary. (h) Because bullets tend to ricochet from a sand bank, the roofs of enclosed ranges should be protected, to prevent penetration. (i) When water traps are used to receive a fired bullet, interlocks shall be provided to prevent firing of the test weapon if water pressure failure occurs. (j) Unburnt propellant from any test firing shall not accumulate in the surrounding area. Safe methods shall be developed for cleanup, decontamination and disposal. §184.185 Velocity and pressure tests. Special high pressure tests or tests of unknown pressure ammunition shall be performed only when personnel are protected against injury from gun failures. Operational shields or remote control firing of guns serves this purpose. §184.186 Primer drop tests. (a) Cases continuing live primers shall be marked and separated from those containing fired primers. (b) The collecting tube and areas where primer dust could accumulate shall be regularly inspected and cleaned.
