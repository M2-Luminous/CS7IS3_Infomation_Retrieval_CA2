FBIS4-15355 "drsov068_t_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-068 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 BALTIC STATES Estonia Malk: Talks End `Without Any Result' Malk: Talks End `Without Any Result' WS0804101294 Tallinn BNS in English 0712 GMT 8 Apr 94 WS0804101294 Tallinn BNS English BFN [Text] TALLINN, Apr 07, BNS - The 18th round of Estonian-Russian negotiations April 5-6 in Moscow ended without any result, Raul Malk, Estonian Foreign Ministry deputy chancellor and a member of the Estonian delegation for the talks, said today at a press conference in Tallinn. Malk said only the humanitarian issues working group made some progress. The two parties agreed to resume talks at the beginning of May. Ago Tiiman, secretary of the Estonian delegation and head of the military issues working group, claimed Estonia was prepared for increased pressure on Russia's part, considering that Latvia and Russia initialed an agreement on social guarantees for military pensioners. "The course of the talks didn't alarm us, although the Russian party demanded sharply and in the form of an ultimatum that Estonia should sign an agreement on military retirees and pay Russia 23 million U.S. dollars (to build housing for the repatriated military in Russia)," Tiiman said. "Since the texts of the initialed Latvian-Russian agreements are available to us, we can say Russia made similar demands on us." Tiiman claimed Russia demanded that Estonia should issue residence permits to all retirees and "give them apartments in perpetuity." Estonia put at the talks the question whether Russia considers that Estonia's legislation concerning military pensioners is inconsistent with international law, which the Russian delegation failed to answer. The Estonian delegation plans at the next round of talks to ask Russia to explain the legal basis for retiring its officers on Estonia's territory. Russia on Wednesday in Moscow officially backed off from the Aug. 31 deadline for the withdrawal of its troops. "Russia itself proposed in November the Aug. 31 deadline. Estonia agreed to it after serious deliberation. Now Russia deleted the date from the text of the agreement without making a new proposal. Thus, instead of the final deadline, there's a gap in the text of the agreement. It shows that the work of the delegations' military issues working groups has no prospects. I don't understand what's the purpose of our meetings," Tiiman said. Tiiman told the press Estonia put forward an "entirely new idea" for dismantling the Paldiski nuclear reactors, which Russia is at present studying. He declined to disclose the details of the proposal. Tiiman said the humanitarian issues working group made some progress in discussions about the maintenance of military graveyards, exchange of prisoners, and citizenship problems. Russia expressed willingness to present lists of Russian citizens residing in Estonia, he stated. Malk told the press the April 1 incident near Petseri when two unidentified persons killed one and wounded two Russian border guards cast a cloud on discussions in the border issues working group. "The parties agreed that absence of a relevant agreement complicates cooperation between the two countries' border guards," Malk said. "They discussed an agreement on cooperation between border officials, and the Estonian delegation asked for an explanation why Russia hasn't as yet ratified the agreement on legal cooperation." Malk declared that so far no facts have come to light to support the claims that the persons who murdered the Russian border guard arrived on Russian-controlled territory from Estonia or that they escaped to Estonia after the crime. The economic issues working group reported no progress. The questions it discussed included an Estonian-Russian agreement on commercial and economic cooperation for 1994, questions of ownership, payment of the former Soviet Union's foreign debt, and compensation for the gold and foreign currency Russia removed from Estonia in 1940. Malk said Russia links economic issues with developments in other spheres, and for that reason "there was no progress in this group, either." In reply to BNS' question whether Estonia will after the failure of the 18th round of talks again consider suspending the negotiations, Malk said a relevant political decision must be made on the government level. Foreign Minister Juri Luik said today at a press conference that Estonian-Russian talks must continue. Europe's support for Russia withdrawing its troops from Estonia by Aug. 31 is very strong, he said. The foreign minister claimed Russia could pull out its troops even sooner than by Aug. 31. "There are no real obstacles to it, it's only Russia's political incapacity," Luik maintained. He added that the western states would react pretty sharply if Russia should drag its feet over the troop withdrawal.
