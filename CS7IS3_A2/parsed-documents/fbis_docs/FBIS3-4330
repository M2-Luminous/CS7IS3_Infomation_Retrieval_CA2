A survey shows that 130 transnational corporations have established 300 projects involving contractual investment totalling three billion U.S. dollars in Shanghai, China's largest economic center, and Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Hubei provinces. Included are one quarter of the world's 100 largest transnational industrial corporations. Shanghai has witnessed the establishment of 204 projects with a total contractual investment of 2.4 billion U.S. dollars by 128 transnational corporations; and Jiangsu, one of China's most economically-developed provinces, has approved the setting up of 60 projects funded by transnational corporations. Ningbo, one of China's 14 open coastal cities in Zhejiang Province, and Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei Province, have reported an increase in the numbers. These projects funded by transnational corporations are in the fields of motor vehicle manufacturing, electronics and telecommunications, computers, biochemicals, new materials, precision instruments and port construction. Economists here agreed that transnational corporations have boosted their confidence in making investment in the Chang Jiang river valley. Robert Allen, chairman of the board of directors of the AT&T company of the United States, said that China is developing toward a modern society and is in need of a host of advanced products. Therefore, his company will pursue a long-term investment strategy in China. According to the chairman, the first project, the Shanghai AT&T company, has become a key enterprise through four years' hard effort. Its products now occupy one-fourth of the market on the mainland. According to the latest statistics, the Chang Jiang river valley has more than 30,000 foreign-funded projects involving more than 35 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for one-fourth of the total foreign investment on the Chinese mainland. So far over 10,000 projects have gone into operation, and 80 percent of them are profitable. Investments made by transnational corporations in the Chang Jiang river valley are concentrated on pillar industries, infrastructure facilities, real estate, tourism facilities and the land development by large tracts. At present, a number of Hong Kong companies are cooperating with Shanghai in improving its urban transport facilities and constructing a commercial center. The Shanghai municipal government plans to open more markets and construction of infrastructure facilities including a power plant, a subway and an airport to attract foreign investment, from transnational corporations in particular, this year. Construction of the Suzhou Industrial Park, a Singapore-Chinese joint venture, is proceeding smoothly. The largest Sino-foreign project in Jiangsu Province, the industrial park, which covers 70 square kilometers, is receiving streams of overseas investors. So far the park has concluded cooperative contracts on more than 50 projects with a sum of three billion U.S. dollars on contract. The projects are in the electronics, machinery, textiles, and tourism industries. Port construction in Shanghai, Nanjing, Lusi, Ningbo and Wuhan along the Chang Jiang river has attracted strong investment from Hong Kong. According to some investors, the Chang Jiang river valley, in particular the Chang Jiang river delta consisting of Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang, has been provided with a better economic foundation, talented people and improved infrastructure facilities. The densely populated area will offer conditions and market for foreign-funded enterprises to prosper.
