As I have learned at the press center of the Supreme Soviet Presidium, legislators in the Supreme Soviet are to discuss approximately 60 issues. Today's session was opened by Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich. The first half hour was devoted to so-called miscellaneous time. Deputies delivered speeches dedicated to different issues connected with our complex socioeconomic and political life. Many of them appealed for the restoration of order in the Republic and for government officials not to work for themselves, taking advantage of their offices, but to work for the greater good of society and our Republic. The floor was taken by People's Deputies Zhykovskiy, Kholod, Antonchuk, Sudys, and others. Deputies agreed to hear speeches from Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich and government representatives concerning Belarus forming a common monetary system with Russia. Later, the Supreme Soviet chairman came forward with a proposal to hold debate on the 44th item on the agenda -- ratification of the CIS Charter. Deputy Prime Minister Uladimir Zalamay delivered a speech on this topic. [Begin Zalamay recording] The main goals of the CIS which are included in this bill are the comprehensive and balanced socioeconomic development of CIS states in the framework of a common economic zone, the improvement of international cooperation and integration, cooperation in protecting peace and international security, implementation of effective measures for reducing weapons and defense expenditures, liquidation of nuclear arms and other types of weapons of mass destruction, accomplishment of complete global disarmament, and the protection of human rights and basic freedoms in accordance with widely recognized norms of international law. [end recording] Later, the floor was taken by Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich. He assessed the situation which has developed concerning the proposed unification of our Republic's monetary-credit system with Russia's. Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich point out that although this is a very complex issue, the government course on unification of the monetary systems is real. People's Deputy Mikhail Zhebryk delivered a speech on ratification of the CIS Charter. Foreign Minister Petr Kravchanka and Defense Minister Pavel Kozlovski also participated in the debate on this issue. The opposition was represented by People's Deputies Uladimir Nolik and Aleh Trusaw. I have invited Defense Minister Pavel Kozlovski to comment on this issue. [Begin recording] [Rutkovskiy] Pavel Pavlovich, deputies are criticizing the CIS Charter, particularly, the part concerning military union. What is your opinion on this issue? [Kozlovskiy, in Russian] We in the [Defense] Ministry believe that this charter [on collective security] should be unconditionally ratified, if we want to become a full member of the CIS; and we have spoken about this. The charter includes a paragraph which directly concerns our military -- the Republic and the Defense Ministry -- and talks about the system of collective security. Addressing this issue at the session, I emphasized that we cannot consider ourselves to be a purely neutral state. Those who once declared their neutrality are now reviewing their statements. Countries are cooperating in Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East, to reduce military expenditures and improve budgets -- to take less from a common taxpayer. Therefore, such a system is not a military union. This is a system of coordinating military cooperation, which is currently being established in the CIS on a parity basis. This (?department) is to help establish the National Armed Forces. [end recording]
