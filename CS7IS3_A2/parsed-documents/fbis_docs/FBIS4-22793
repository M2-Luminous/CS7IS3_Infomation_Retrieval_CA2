In 1994, it is planned to increase gold production in the country by 3 to 4 percent over 1993. In the opinion of the committee's managers, the adoption of a number of economic and organizational measures has contributed to relative stabilization in the sector. For example, the rights of the administration in regions have been extended to the issuance of licenses to extract precious metals and stones and the attraction of foreign capital in developing the deposits and selling the metals produced. The introduction of world prices in 1992 to pay for the gold extracted was important as well. The Russian Ministry of Finance has announced plans to introduce a new system this year for gold purchases in the country, in accordance with which producers will sell half of the metal they turn out in the domestic market. Under the new arrangement, the state will buy 50 percent of the gold produced in the country, 20 to 30 percent of this through the Central Bank and commercial banks which have licenses to conduct transactions in precious metals. Producers will sell the remaining metal in order to reinvest the funds received in production development. A competition has been announced for the right to develop the Asachinsk and Rodniki deposits where reserves of the metal is estimated at 70 metric tons and the ore here has a high gold content--20 grams per metric ton. Interest in the competition has been expressed by several foreign and joint venture firms, including "Caminco Venture Gold" and "New Grest Mining." An application has also been made by the "Russian Gold Mining Corporation." It is expected that results of the competition will be reported in June. The American company Morrison-Knudsen Corp. ("MK") should begin extracting gold in Kyrgyzstan in 1995 at an enterprise in which $100 million is being invested. Under the agreement concluded with the country's government, the wholly-owned subsidiary firm "MK Gold" will develop the Dzheruy gold deposit jointly with the Kyrgyz state company "Kyrgyzaltyn." Reserves at the deposit, which can be worked by the open method, are estimated at roughly 80 metric tons of gold, extracted from ore with a gold content of 6 grams per metric ton. The new enterprise is expected to turn out over 4.5 metric tons of gold annually. Under the agreement, "MK Gold" will receive 30 percent of the profit from operating the mine and the country's government will receive 70 percent. The "Kyrgyzaltyn" company will acquire the right to sell the gold in the domestic market and in other countries. Tajikistan, through the "Tajik Gold" firm, concluded an agreement a year ago with the "Gulf International Minerals" company for technical assistance in reequipping the existing "Kansay" enterprise. In the near future, the Canadian "Gulf International" company expects to receive results of the gold concentrates shipped to Japan from this mine. Work is now under way at the Tajik mine mentioned to increase gold output, and in addition, a survey of other gold deposits in the country has been completed. The joint venture company has concluded an agreement with the Tajikistan Government to process tailings from the Darvas region. Under the agreement, "Gulf" will pay the expenses for fuel, install new equipment, and provide technical supervision, while the government will provide the mine with manpower, available equipment, and electricity. According to official data, about 22 metric tons of gold have been produced in the Darvas region, where the largest alluvial deposit of gold in Tajikistan is located. According to the "Gulf" company's estimate, there are about 5 metric tons of gold in the tailings from this deposit, with a gold content of 2 grams per cubic meter. The company has also surveyed the primary reserves of placer gold at this deposit, which are estimated at 18 metric tons, with a gold content of 0.95 frams per cubic meter. "Gulf" has preference for further joint activity with "Tajik Gold" in developing these reserves. As reported by EKOTASS, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will grant a loan to Uzbekistan to complete construction of a gold mining complex being carried out by the Uzbek-American joint venture "Zarafshan-Newmont." The projected cost of the operation is estmated at $150 million. The new enterprise plans to extract gold from tailings at the Muruntau deposit, the world's largest gold deposit where the gold can be extracted by the open method. In Kazakhstan, the "Zoloto Kazakhstana" program, aimed at increasing the country's gold production, has been drafted and is now under way. It is assumed that by 1997, Kazakhstan may become one of the world's 10 largest gold-producing countries. According to a report from the INTERFAX agency, Georgia plans to extract 1.5 metric tons of gold in 1994 and to increase its production of this metal to 4 metric tons in 1997. Georgia produced 1.9 metric tons in 1991, but the economic crisis in the country led to a decrease in the country's gold output. It is estimated that 1 metric ton was turned out in 1993. The company "Hol-Lac Gold Mines," headquartered in Toronto, has concluded an agrement with the Ukrainian state company "Geoprognoz" for geological exploration operations to locate precious metals (as well as the basic nonferrous metals and diamonds) in Ukraine. "Hol-Lac Gold Mines" will will finance the operation over a 5-year period. "Geoprognoz" will provide assistance in obtaining authorization for prospecting and will provide a group of geologists to search for the minerals.
