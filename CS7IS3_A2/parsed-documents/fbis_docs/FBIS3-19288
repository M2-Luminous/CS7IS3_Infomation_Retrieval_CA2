Mr. Reynolds was speaking in New York about the IRA statement which calls for a reopening of direct links with the British Government. From New York, our political editor Donal Kelly: [Kelly] Mr. Reynolds played down the significance of the IRA statement, saying he saw nothing new in it. He made clear there could be no talks between two parties about the peace process to the exclusion of all others. And anyway, he said, it was only by a cessation of violence that talks could take place with everybody around the table. If violence ended then the forum for peace and reconciliation could get underway, as well as the preliminary talks between Sinn Fein and the British Government, leading to full all-party negotiations. Asked if he thought the IRA was indicating the declaration did not go far enough, the taoiseach said that if they didn't like it there was nothing to stop them ending violence and getting around the negotiating table. However, he said, he was still cautiously optimistic about the prospects for the declaration. It would form the basis for future talks, he said, with or without Sinn Fein.
