Kremlin sources, who said earlier that President Boris Yeltsin's meeting with Nixon was now "problematic", have just told ITAR-TASS that the Russian president has refused to meet the American visitor. Competent sources told ITAR-TASS that the cancellation of these meetings was decided after the former American president met former Russian Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy, amnestied recently. Nixon's initiative must have been seen as a sign of disrespect for the political will of the Russian leadership. On Tuesday, Richard Nixon told journalists that Russian authorities had not hampered his contacts with the leaders of the oppositional forces. But to all appearances, after demonstrating their democratic thinking, Viktor Chernomyrdin and Sergey Filatov reserved the right to view Nixon's contacts with opposition leaders, including one of the organisers of the armed resistance to President Yeltsin last autumn, as they saw fit.
