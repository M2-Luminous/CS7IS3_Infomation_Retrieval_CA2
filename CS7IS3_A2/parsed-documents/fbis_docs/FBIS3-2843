"We must further emancipate the mind and guide Tibet's economic development with new concepts and new thinking that are suited for a socialist market economy," he said. He asked local officials to take Tibet's special conditions into consideration, do everything in accordance with the reality of Tibet, always serve the interests of Tibetan people, promote Tibet's development, maintain its stability and continuously carry forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle. "The party Central Committee and the State Council have always attached great importance to Tibet work, having adopted a series of preferential policies and flexible measures for the Tibet region," he said. During the process of developing a socialist market economy, the central authorities will continue to pay great attention to economic development and social progress in Tibet, he said. He expressed the belief that Tibet will have a bright future thanks to the correct leadership of the party Central Committee, hard struggle by the Tibetan people and support from the rest of China. Hu, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, expressed the views in a group discussion with Tibetan deputies to the National People's Congress now in session in the Chinese capital. Talking about Premier Li Peng's government work report delivered yesterday at an NPC session, Hu said the report spells out the national task of seizing development opportunities, deepening reform, opening the country wider to the rest of the world, promoting economic development and maintaining social stability. "All our work must be concentrated on fulfilling this central task," he said. "And it is imperative to promptly solve problems that should crop up amid continuous progress."
