Minister Maira asserted that together with the Finance Ministry efforts are being made to draft a budget that, while observing a balanced allocation of funds, "will allow us to use the resources as best possible, granting priority to the various public sector projects." The minister announced that a Latin American Social and Poverty Funds Network [Red Lationamericana de Fondos Sociales y de Pobreza] will be created in Santiago on 20 June. To this purpose a regional meeting to discuss "alternatives to financing programs designed to overcome poverty" will be held. A total of 21 Latin American and Caribbean delegations will participate in this event. The current government has made the struggle against poverty its priority target. The government intends to pull the 1.2 million Chileans who currently live in extreme poverty out of this situation. Today Maira explained that the National Program to Overcome Poverty has no populist purpose. The Planning Minister said: "We have carefully tried to avoid creating overblown expectations. We have not set regional targets or objectives that could suggest improvements greater than conditions will allow."
