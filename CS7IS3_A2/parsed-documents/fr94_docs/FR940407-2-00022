FR940407-2-00022 FR940407-2-00014 [I.D. 032194B] Marine Mammals AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), NOAA, Commerce. ACTION: Modification of Public Display Permit, Canada's Wonderland (P264). SUMMARY: On April 7, 1981, notice was published in the Federal Register (46 FR 21404) that Permit Number 324 had been issued to Canada's Wonderland, 9580 Jane Street, P.O. Box 624, Maple, Ontario L0J 1EO. Notice is hereby given that on March 23, 1994 as authorized by the provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.), and Regulations Governing the Taking and Importing of Marine Mammals (50 CFR part 216), the NMFS modified Permit No. 324 to eliminate the number of Atlantic bottlenose dolphins ( Tursiops truncatus ) and to increase the number of California sea lions ( Zalophus californianus ) in Section A., ``Number and Kind of Marine Mammals.'' This modification is necessary due to renovations being made to a former dolphin holding facility at Canada's Wonderland for use by six California sea lions from Marine Animal Productions (MAP), Inc. of Gulfport, MS, for public display. This modification also reflects that the use of six Atlantic bottlenose dolphins ( Tursiops truncatus ) from Marine Animal Productions, Inc. is no longer authorized. ADDRESSES: The modified Permit is available for review, by appointment, in the following offices: Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, NOAA, 1315 East West Highway, room 13130, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910, (301) 713&hyph;2289; and Director, Southeast Region, NMFS, 9450 Koger Boulevard, St. Petersburg, Florida 33702, (813) 893&hyph;3141. Dated: March 23, 1994. Herbert W. Kaufman, Deputy Director, Office of Protected Resources, National Marine Fisheries Service.
