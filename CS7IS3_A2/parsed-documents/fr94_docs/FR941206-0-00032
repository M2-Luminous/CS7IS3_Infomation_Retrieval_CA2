FR941206-0-00032 FR941206-0-00006 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Internal Revenue Service 26 CFR Part 1 [TD 8570] RIN 1545&hyph;AS96 Nonbank Trustee Net Worth Requirements AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. ACTION: Temporary regulations. SUMMARY: This document contains temporary regulations that provide guidance to nonbank trustees with respect to the adequacy of net worth requirements of §1.401&hyph;12(n) (6) and (7) of the Income Tax Regulations. The text of these temporary regulations also serves as the text of the proposed regulations set forth in the notice of proposed rulemaking on this subject in the Proposed Rules section of this issue of the Federal Register . DATES: These regulations are effective December 6, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Judith E. Alden, (202) 622&hyph;6030 (not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background This document contains amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under section 401(d)(1). Sections 1022(c), 1022(d), and 2002(a)(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), Pub. L. 93&hyph;406 (1974), amended sections 401(d), 401(f), and 408 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) to permit an entity that is not a bank to be a trustee or a custodian for purposes of those Code sections if such entity demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Treasury that it will administer the trust and hold assets in a manner consistent with the law. Although section 401(d)(1) was repealed by section 237(a) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, Pub. L. 97&hyph;248 (1982), the regulations under section 401(d)(1) remain in force and effect to the extent that they govern the determination of whether an entity can be a nonbank trustee or custodian for purposes of Treasury Regulation §§1.401(f)&hyph;1 and 1.408&hyph;2(d). Section 1.401&hyph;12(n)(6)(ii) of the regulations, proposed in 1975 and finalized in 1979 under section 401(d)(1) of the Code, sets forth net worth requirements for nonbank trustees based on the greater of a specified dollar amount or a percentage of the value of all assets held by the nonbank trustee in fiduciary accounts. A primary objective of this adequacy of net worth requirement has been to ensure that nonbank trustees maintain a level of solvency commensurate with their financial and fiduciary responsibilities. Pursuant to the existing net worth requirements, nonbank trustees may not accept new accounts unless their net worth exceeds the greater of $100,000 or four percent of the value of all assets held in fiduciary accounts. Additionally, nonbank trustees must take whatever steps are necessary (including the relinquishment of fiduciary accounts) to ensure that their net worth exceeds the greater of $50,000 or two percent of the value of assets held in their fiduciary accounts. While similar requirements apply to passive nonbank trustees (qualified nonbank entities that have no discretion to direct the investment of assets), the percentage requirements for these trustees are lower. Specifically, passive nonbank trustees may not accept new accounts unless their net worth exceeds the greater of $100,000 or two percent of the value of all assets held in fiduciary accounts and they must take appropriate action (including the relinquishment of fiduciary accounts) to ensure that their net worth exceeds the greater of $50,000 or one percent of the value of assets held in their fiduciary accounts. The IRS has received comments that this requirement is unduly restrictive in the case of passive trustees who are broker-dealers regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and who are required to have their fiduciary accounts protected by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). SIPC, established by Congress in 1970, insures customer assets and funds held by a U.S. broker-dealer in the case of an insolvency in an amount of up to $500,000 per customer, of which $100,000 may be cash. Thus, with respect to SIPC protected assets, the on-going net worth requirement provides little if any increase in protection of assets held in fiduciary accounts. Accordingly, these temporary regulations provide that SIPC protected assets will be disregarded in determining the value of assets held in fiduciary accounts by passive trustees for purposes of the percentage prong of the net worth requirement.
