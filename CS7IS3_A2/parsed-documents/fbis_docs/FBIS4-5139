He said that Malaysia's reserves were very strong and that the country's assets which exceed 100 billion ringgit are very huge in the context of gross domestic product. The latest figure which showed 76 billion ringgit reserves was quite progressive. He pointed out that even if the Central Bank did not trade, the country would still have lost money simply because of the appreciating ringgit on the back of the robust economy. Datuk Sri Anwar, who is also finance minister, was responding to questions by Swedish journalists accompanying Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt on a three-day visit to Malaysia. The deputy prime minister said that he had in 1992 ordered Bank Negara cease trading in the forex market after learning that the Central Bank had been incurring losses. Describing the forex losses of 9 billion ringgit in 1992 and 5.7 billion ringgit last year by Bank Negara as a serious error in judgment, he said he had instructed the Central Bank at that time not to excessively trade in reserves. He said that the Finance Ministry became aware of the losses about one and a half years ago. The Swedish journalists also posed several questions ranging from Malaysia-Sweden bilateral relations to human rights. Datuk Sri Anwar said Malaysia did not condone abuse of human rights by any country or government. But at the same time, Malaysia does not expect the Western countries to insist that certain countries should observe their rules. He said Western countries should learn to understand and appreciate the situation in certain countries in the East, especially Asia. It was true to some extent that developed countries in the West had a lot to offer developing countries in the East, but they should also learn to accept and respect the values and norms of the countries in the East, particularly in Asia.
