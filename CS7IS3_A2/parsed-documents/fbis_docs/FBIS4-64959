And the PS-PSC [French-speaking Socialist Party-Social Christian Party] tandem is doing no better. A good month from the European elections, our latest Dimarso opinion poll appears deeply disturbing for the sitting coalition: On both sides of the language border the Catholic-Socialist partners are looking together at another 10 percent loss compared with the end results of "Black Sunday," 24 November 1991. Dimarso took a telephone survey of 1,000 Flemish voters, an equal number of Walloons and 400 Brussels citizens. The poll was taken between 9 and 28 April, a period including the Easter holidays during which no polling was carried out. The Antwerp BBTK [Socialist Union of Employees] scandal is still affecting the SP badly: In April, the Flemish Socialists did not recover from the heavy blow they received in our March poll. They even dropped a little lower (a statistically insignificant 0.1 percent) to 15.2 percent. This is more than 4 percent lower than the results of November 1991. The CVP stands at 21.5 percent and has made a 0.5 percent gain from March. But it remains a good 5 percent below the previous vote. Taken together, the Flemish majority parties are not doing worse than in the previous month, but considerably worse than just before the end of last year when the Dehaene government started to benefit briefly from its anticrisis policies. Immediately afterward, it got lost in scandals. Translated into forecasts for the European elections of 12 June, then both majority parties would at present lose a Strasbourg seat. The forecasts remain somewhat rough and ready, because Dimarso is not making any forecasts: "These voter intentions must not be interpreted as a prediction, but as a thermometer of the political climate," it says. The CVP could even lose a second seat in this state of affairs: It is no longer certain that outgoing MEP [Member of European Parliament] Raf Chanterie, number four on the list, will be reelected. The VLD [Flemish Liberal Democrats] (29.2 percent) are remaining gently stationary: They no longer exceed the 30 percent barrier, but this result would still be enough to get them at least two seats in Strasbourg, and give them an outside chance of three seats. The possible third extra seat for the liberals depends largely on what the VU [People's Union] will do on 12 June. The VU (now at 7.4 percent) has gained a good 1.0 percent from March. The resurrection of ROSSEM is striking: It now stands at 2.9 percent, or 1 percent more than last month. In parallel with the percentage point gain for ROSSEM, Agalev [Flemish Greens] has dropped (roughly) one point to 11.7 percent. If there was no ROSSEM list, then the reallocation of these voting intentions could help give the Greens another European seat. At least, if this additional seat is not taken by the Flemish Bloc. Support for Dillen also dropped by (close to) 1 percent, according to our poll, and comes out at around 11 percent. Then there are the French-speakers. The PS, with 31.6 percent, is showing a 1.1 percent improvement. But after the Agusta scandal, the Carlier affair in Henegouwen also has to be digested. The PSC has dropped below 20 percent again to 19.3 percent, down 1.2 percent. The PRL [Radical Liberal Party] has not moved at 23.1 percent. And with 15.8 percent (down 0.1 percent), nor did Ecolo [French-speaking Greens] manage to beat its provisional high point of February. Does that share out the European cards? Perhaps not. The success ratio (the relationship between voting intentions and potential) of the VLD is close to its ceiling with 60 percent. Number 2 on the success ranking, the CVP, could improve from 47 percent. But not by much: Since last summer, the Christian Democrats have not had a success ratio of more than 50 percent. Apparently the CVP will be unable to do more than safeguard its fourth European seat, one less than it now has. All the other parties can in theory dream of a turnaround, according to this political thermometer. For example, the SP is getting a share of only 42 percent in the Socialist potential. Agalev has no more than 35 percent. And the VU has only 23 percent. In other words: The market is still wide open for them. But attention must be attracted; it is urgent to score and time is gradually running out.
