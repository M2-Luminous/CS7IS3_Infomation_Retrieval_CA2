FR940405-0-00035 FR940405-0-00004 11. Several organizations and individuals inquired if accelerators were nuclear facilities and, thus, are covered by the DOE nuclear safety requirements in part 830. Response: Accelerators are specifically excluded from the definition of a nonreactor nuclear facility, and, as such, are excluded from the provisions of part 830. Accelerators are not excluded from the radiation protection provisions of proposed part 835 since that part covers nuclear activities rather than nuclear facilities. 12. One comment suggested that transportation and shipping be included in the definition of a nonreactor nuclear facility because these operations could involve radioactive materials in sufficient quantities to have a potential impact on the health and safety of the public and workers, or damage the environment. Response: DOE agrees that transportation and shipping could involve significant quantities of radioactive materials, and did not intend to cover these activities in the proposed sections of part 830. Therefore, we have specifically excluded transportation of radioactive materials from the definition of nonreactor nuclear facility in the final rule. These activities take place primarily off-site and are governed and regulated by either the U.S. Department of Transportation or the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission rules. With regard to shipments on DOE sites, DOE intends to add provisions covering these operations in subsequent amendments to the rule. 13. One comment suggested that DOE be included in the definition of the term ``person.'' Response: The proposed definition is the same as the definition in the AEA which specifically excludes DOE. DOE believes that the rule need not be amended to include DOE because DOE imposes equivalent requirements on its employees through DOE orders. 14. One comment suggested that the definition of ``process'' be modified to include administrative as well as physical systems. Response: The definition of ``process'' is intended to include administrative and physical systems. To make this intent more clear in the definition, DOE has replaced the term ``system'' with ``series.'' 15. One comment suggested that the words ``fails to meet'' be deleted from the definition of ``quality.'' Another comment suggested that the phrase ``degree to which'' be replaced by ``condition achieved when.'' Response: The Department agrees that these two suggested changes result in a definition of ``quality'' that better reflects the Department's intent. The modifications have been made. 16. A comment suggested that the definition of reactor was too broad, and that it be limited to include only the reactor, containment, and critical support systems. It was suggested that such things as ancillary support facilities and shops be excluded from the definition. Response: DOE generally disagrees with this comment. The Department feels that all of the operations connected with a reactor should be included in the definition because experience has shown that failures in ancillary support facilities can propagate and cause failures to safety related systems. However, specific items can be excluded from the application of nuclear safety requirements on a case-by-case basis through the exemption process set forth in 10 CFR part 820. 17. A comment suggested that the ``reactor'' definition developed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), with which everyone in the industry is familiar, should be used instead of the one in the proposed rulemaking. Response: DOE disagrees with this comment. The NRC definition for ``nuclear reactor'' contained in 10 CFR part 50 addresses standardized power reactors. The population of DOE reactors is more diverse, including multiple designs and sizes of reactors all with different purposes. For these reasons, the Department developed its own definition for ``reactor.'' 18. One comment suggested that the definition for the term ``record'' be expanded to note that it is a document which is completed according to applicable procedures governing its development, including any review and approval requirements. Response: DOE disagrees with this suggestion because the proposed additions make the definition too limiting. For completeness, DOE has added the term ``service'' to the definition. 19. It was suggested that the definition of service was incomplete without the addition of the words ``construction, testing, environmental qualification, equipment qualification, and `or the like''' to the definition. Response: The Department agrees with the comment and has modified the definition accordingly. 20. One individual expressed concern over the confusion that could potentially arise from the statement in 10 CFR 830.4 that, ``contractors responsible for design, construction, operations, or decommissioning of a facility shall be responsible for compliance with this Part.'' In the potential situation where an M&O contractor performs construction activities at an existing facility being run by another M&O contractor, the individual questioned whether one or both of the contractors would be held accountable for compliance with nuclear safety requirements. Response: Section 830.4(a) provides that all persons must act in accordance with part 830. Enforcement through the assessment of civil penalties will apply only where there is a nexus between a person's activity and the violation. For example, a person who designs a facility will not be responsible for a violation related to the operation of the facility unless the design was somehow responsible for the violation. 21. A comment stated that it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to comply with ยง830.4(b) which requires facilities being decommissioned to meet the requirements of this Part. Response: While facilities in the decommissioning phase will be required to comply with the provisions of this rule, the level to which they are applied will be based on a graded approach taking into consideration the hazards associated with a facility being decommissioned.
