The Tbilisi thermal power station, the main suuplier of electricity to the republic, is operating again, and three of its ten power units will soon reach their capacity output of 500 kilowatt per hour each. The director of the Tbilisi power station told ITAR-TASS that a special committe has been established to investigate the causes of the breakdown. It may have been caused by the overload of the Georgian power system, which is now cut off from the power systems of the neihbouring Russia and Azerbaijan. "This is why we cannot get hooked up to them in an emergency as before," he said. According to the director, the three power units can operate now but two of them will be kept in reserve. The other seven are worn out and need a capital overhaul, which can hardly be expected to be made soon because of Georgia's severed economic links with other former Soviet republics.
