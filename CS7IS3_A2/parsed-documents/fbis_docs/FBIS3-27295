A contract was signed between the two sides here today. The two satellites are expected to be placed in orbit over 119 degrees west longitude. The launch of Echostar 1 is slated for late summer of 1995 and of Echostar 2, for mid-1996. Both satellites will be sent into space from the Xichang satellite launch center on China's 2-stage Long March 2e carrier rocket. CGWIC will also supply Echostar with a solid motor (epkm) [expansion unknown] for each launch. Charlie Ergen, chairman of Echostar, said that the satellite manufacturer, Martin Marietta, anticipates receiving required satellite export licenses in the near future. Ergen said that a major reason for Echostar's choosing to work with CGWIC is that the Long March 2e rocket can ensure a minimum life of 17 years for the satellites, a term which can not be provided by many Western space companies. In addition, CGWIC's competitive price, sincere cooperative spirit and experiences in successfully launching overseas satellites were also important considerations in making the decision. Echostar 1 and 2 are Martin Marietta Astro Space Series 7000 satellites, both with 16 transponders. Their successful launch would enable Echostar to provide over one hundred channels of video, audio and data communications services accessible to virtually every single-family household in the continental United States utilizing an 18-inch satellite dish. Echostar's home receiver and antenna systems will incorporate digital compression technology with the potential to deliver programming including sports, popular cable services, pay-per-view movies, databases, educational services and hdtv [high definition television]. At today's contract-signing ceremony, Vice President of CGWIC Liu Zhixiong said that in the next two years CGWIC will launch six overseas satellites. Starting from 1996, CGWIC will launch Echostar 2 and a series of iridium satellites for Motorola. At present a number of foreign satellite companies are negotiating satellite launch arrangements with CGWIC.
