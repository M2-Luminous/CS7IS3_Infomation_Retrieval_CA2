The national economy continued to grow on the basis of its 1992 development. At the same time, the various problems which had cropped up when the old system was being replaced by the new and the economy was rapidly developing also became more outstanding. People began to feel the potential pressure from inflation. From the second half of 1993, the party central committee and the State Council started to rectify the financial order and strengthen the macro-control. After several months, the national economy has begun to stabilize, and the prices on the market have returned to normality to a certain extent. It is expected that in 1994, the economic growth rate will drop slightly, but it will still register a fairly high rate of growth. There will be slightly less investments. However, an adequate amount of investments are needed in order to strengthen structural readjustment. The scale of price increases will become smaller, but the pressure from inflation and commodity prices will remain relatively high. Price reform will be carried out within the endurance of the different sectors of society. Rational reform measures will be announced continuously and at the right time. I. Situation and Characteristics of China's Market Prices in 1993 From January to September 1993, the total volume of retail sales rose 22.4 percent over the same period in 1992. The general level of retail prices in the whole country was increased by 12.1 percent and residents' living expenses was up 1.37 percent over the corresponding period in 1992, of which the living expenses in 35 large and medium-sized cities rose 18.9 percent. Examining the situation of market prices in 1993, we notice the following characteristics: 1. The market of consumer goods was lively and flourishing. From January to September, the total volume of retail sales rose 22.4 percent with an actual growth rate of 9.3 percent if price increases were factored in. China's market of consumer goods could clearly be divided into two stages: (1) During the first half of 1993, China's market of consumer goods registered a continuous growth with the rate of growth increasing every month. (2) During the second half of 1993, the market slowed down, but still witnessed a moderate, steady growth. The signs were: (A) Market sales began to decline. The growth rate of the volume of retail sales in July was 1.9 percent lower than that in June, and that of August was 4.6 percent lower than that of June. (B) The phenomenon of shopping spree to preserve the value of money once noticed in the first half of the year basically disappeared, and the sales of imported and famous brand home appliances and jewelry had notably declined. (C) The trend of group purchases of consumer goods was curbed. The rate of growth in this type of purchase dropped from the average rate of over 30 percent in the first half of 1993 to approximately 22 percent between August and September, which was lower than that of average residents. 2. The market of producer goods had changed from a continuous strong market in the first half of the year to a relatively weak one. Sharply rising prices had slowly declined. The main signs were: (1) The market sales were notably declining. The rate of growth of the sales volume dropped from 49.5 percent in the first half of 1993 to 27.3 percent in the third quarter. The sellers' market was gradually changed to a buyers' market. In addition to the influence of the macro-economic control, there were two more factors which brought about the market changes in terms of supply and demand. (A) A strong macro-control had basically eliminated the demand of a speculative nature. (B) A large amount of imported producer goods have arrived, and the total volume of supplies has increased. (2) The inventory had greatly increased, making the continuously dwindling stock level to sharply rise. (3) The price of producer goods dropped. The growth rate of the general price index for producer goods dropped from 52.9 percent in June to 43.2 percent in August. 3. The scale of retail price increases had notably expanded since the beginning of 1993. People had begun to feel the potential pressure of inflation. After the macro-control was tightened, the price increases had slowed down. Between January and September, the general level of retail prices was 12.1 percent higher than that in the same period in 1992. Although prices continued to rise during the second half of 1993, the price increases had slowed down. The reasons for the price increases to decline were as follows: (A) Except for the price increases in railway freight charges and electric power, there were no new projects for price reform during the second half of 1993. (B) The effects of the several price reform projects on grain, coal and freight transportation, which took effect in the second half of 1992 gradually disappeared in the second half of 1993. (C) The fall of the prices for producer goods brought down the production costs. If we examined the price increases on various kinds of commodities and services, the retail price of consumer goods rose 11.8 percent between January and September. From the regional point of view, retail prices in urban areas were up 12.6 percent, while that in rural areas rose 11.8 percent. The prices of service items in urban areas rose 31.6 percent and those in rural areas were up 25.6 percent. In October 1993, we had predicted the trend of market prices in China for the fourth quarter on the basis of the inflationary trend and the market prices at that time. We forecast that the general price level would continue to climb up, but the upward trend of prices would level off. The general level of retail prices for 1993 would be approximately 13 percent. 4. According to the requirements in developing the socialist market economy, progress of a breakthrough nature was made in changing the mechanism of price formulation. Following the promulgation and revision of the list of price control items and the decision to decontrol government-fixed prices on a large scale in 1992, we had adopted a series of measures to change the mechanism of price formulation and made progress of a breakthrough nature. The measures were as follows: (1) Except for some individual provinces and autonomous regions, we had basically decontrol the price for purchasing grain and cooking oil on the basis of the principle of "unifying the policies, decentralizing policy-making power, giving the proper guidance and implementing the measures gradually." (2) State control was lifted on the distribution and the price of coal. (3) Price control on most of the iron and steel products was lifted. (4) The prices of some cement products, telecommunications switchboard equipment, heavy-duty trucks for civilian use, fire trucks and fire-fighting equipment were decontrolled. (5) Prices for products used by railway industry were decontrolled on a large scale. (6) Prices were properly appraised for the grain, chemical fertilizer, cotton, wood pulp and raw materials for detergents which were imported with foreign exchange of the central government. (G) Authority for collecting 22 types of administrative fees such as the charge for issuing visas to foreigners was delegated to the lower level. The administrative department in charge of fee collection may determine themselves the amount to be collected. At the end of 1992, the share of state-controlled prices was only 5.9 percent of the total volume of retail sales, approximately 12.5 percent of the total amount of funds used in purchasing farm and sideline products and 18.7 percent of the total amount of revenues from the sales of producer goods. The share of state-set prices was even smaller in 1993, following the development of the market economy. In general, market has played a main leading role in price formation for both consumer and producer goods. 5. Emphasis was made in solving the problem of excessive low prices for basic industrial products, and great strides were made in readjusting the price structure. After the state had adjusted the prices of grain, coal, petroleum and transportation fees and raised the prices of iron and steel, chemical fertilizer, postal and telecommunications services and waterway freight charges in 1992, it once again made relatively large strides in readjusting the price structure in 1993. (1) In order to stimulate the production of petroleum, expand the capacity in producing crude oil, economize on the use of petroleum and change the situation in China where oil price was relative low, 30 million tons of "average grade petroleum were processed to become high-grade petroleum," and the price of processed oil was duly raised in 1993. (2) In order to further raise funds for construction and accelerate the development of railway transportation, the railway freight charges for one ton of cargo was increased by 1.5 fen per km from 3.85 to 5.35 fen in 1993. (3) The price of electricity was raised in order to rectify the price structure for electricity and do away with the unreasonable utility price. (4) The state-controlled price of lumber from state-owned forest districts in Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, Sichuan and Yunnan was increased. (5) The ex-factory prices for copper and zinc products produced within the state plan were raised. According to a preliminary estimate, The measures adopted by the state in readjusting the prices in 1993 had directly pushed the general level of commodity prices approximately 2.5 percent upward. The successful adoption of these aforementioned measures had played a significant role in improving China's irrational price structure and developing its basic industries. 6. The system of exercising the macro-control over market price was further improved. Since 1993, our national economy registered rapid growth on the basis of the progress made in the previous year in the fields of production, construction, commodity circulation and consumption. At the same time, some new problems and contradictions have also become more outstanding. Particularly the excessive issuance of currency on the market, the chaotic financial order, the rapidly increasing demand for investments and consumption and the "bottleneck" effects of infrastructural facilities and basic industries had caused the market price to increase on a large scale, and further aggravated the inflationary trend. Under this situation, the party central committee and the State Council took command of the entire economic situation, and followed the guiding thought that, "in doing economic work, it is necessary to seize the opportunity, accelerate the development and pay attention to adopting reliable measures while avoiding losses, particularly great losses." They decided to adopt a series of measures to improve and strengthen the macro-control by deepening reform and perfecting the market system. They used economic, legal and necessary administrative means to effectively control the economy. After a certain period of time, they had attained preliminary results in exercising the macro-control. The main signs were as follows: (A) The practice of illegal interbank short-term loans was curbed. (B) Various kinds of illegal fund-raising activities were preliminarily controlled. Saving deposits increased on a large scale, and the excessive issuance of currency was checked. (C) The exchange rate of the RENMINBI had become reasonable. (D) The price of producer goods declined to a certain extent, while the price of real estate dropped by a large margin. (E) The residents were less worried about the inflationary trend. II. Forecast of Trend of Market Price Regulation in 1994 After going through the two years of high-speed growth, China's economy had undergone tremendous changes in its macro-economic environment. The role of its market mechanism is gradually being bolstered. The overall national strength has been notably enhanced. Initial results have been attained in exercising macro-economic control, and problems in the economic life have been solved to a certain extent. The national economy is developing healthily, and favorable conditions are being created for the development of the reform and opening program in an overall manner. The 1990s are the crucial stage for developing China's socialist modernization. China is faced with an opportunity rarely seen in history. In face of the new situation and task, we must not hesitate to promote the reform and opening program. We must quicken our tempo in building the socialist market economic system and develop our economy continuously, rapidly and healthily in 1994. For this, we must still maintain a relatively high growth rate in developing our national economy in 1994. According to a forecast made by a relevant expert, the growth rate of GNP will be over 10 percent, that of investments in fixed assets and that of retail sales will exceed 20 percent. Reform will be actively carried out in the fields of fiscal levy, finance, pricing, investment, foreign trade and enterprise system in 1994. All these will have a great impact on the market price in 1994. Meantime, we should not ignore the effect of the excessive currency issued in 1993 and forget the inertia of the sharp price increases in 1993. If we carefully examine the current environment which will affect the 1994 market price, we will come to realize that there are factors which are conducive to stabilizing the market price, while there are also factors which will push the market price upward. Factors that are conducive to stabilizing the price are as follows: 1. The financial order had improved, and the financial situation became stabilized. (A) Indiscriminate short-term interbank loans, arbitrary fund-raising activities and the random establishment of financial institutions were basically stopped. (B) Residents' savings deposits rose every month. As of the end of September in 1993, the amount of savings deposits had reached 1.3867 trillion yuan, an increase of 232.2 billion yuan as compared with that at the end of 1992. (C) The trend of excessive bank financing was curbed, and the supply of currency notably slowed down. (D) The specialized banks' capability to make payments was improved. As of the end of September, the rate of reserve for the deposits of the specialized banks had reached the normal rate of 7.2 percent. 2. The order in fiscal levy improved, and initial results were attained in further increasing revenue and reducing expenditures. The order in fiscal levy had notably improved, and the situation whereby the economy during the first half of the year was rapidly growing while the state revenue declined was initially solved by stopping irrational tax remission and reduction practices and dealing severe blows at various activities of tax evasion. At the same time, the rapid rise in state expenditure was controlled to a certain extent. 3. The order in the producer goods market, the stock market, the futures market, the foreign exchange market, the real estate market and the development zones also improved. The announcement of measures to exercise macro-economic control such as regulating the money market and cleaning up the real estate market and the development zones had notably curbed the activities of a speculative nature and the effects of the "bubble economy." The signs were: (1) the speculative activities on the producer goods market had notably weakened, the supply of producer goods became more abundant and their prices dropped. (2) Some of the development zones which failed to meet the specified requirements were abolished, and measures to continuously clean them up were being carried out. (3) There were less investments in developing commercial housing projects. The prices of real estate in the coastal areas dropped by approximately 20 percent. (4) The stock market and the futures market gradually became stabilized. (5) The exchange rate of U.S. dollars to the RENMINBI on the foreign currency swap market was stabilized around US$1 to 8.8 yuan. 4. Some factors which affected the market price were changing.(A) The prices of grain, fuel for civilian use and building materials which greatly affected the general level of retail prices were basically decontrolled in recent years. Their effect will become less outstanding on the market price in 1994. (B) The prices of many types of producer goods were close to or exceeded the average prices on the international market. Their prices are expected to stabilize and remain at a higher level. (C) The residents' psychology on spending became more matured. There were more rational purchasing than panic buying. Consumer goods were often purchased in a planned manner. (D) Notable changes took place in income distribution. More money was set aside for savings, housing and purchasing stocks and bonds, while spending on consumer goods was often postponed. 5. The rapid growth in national economy increased the effective supply of the market, and provided a solid material foundation for the society to maintain a basic balance between supply and demand. 6. All kinds of reform programs were being developed to gradually and basically solve problems left over by the old system, and ease off the potential inflationary pressure. The factors which caused the prices to rise were as follows: 1. The total demand in society remained strong. From the point of view of investment demand, the growth of investment in fixed assets was somewhat weakened during the second half of 1993, but it was far from being ideal. It was still notably higher than the normal amount. This was harmful to maintaining stable and healthy development of the economy and stabilizing the market. From the point of view of consumer demand, the incomes of urban and rural residents continued to increase on a large scale. Between January and September, the incomes of urban residents used as living expenses grew 29 percent. The actual rate of growth was 12 percent if price increases were factored in. The cash net incomes of rural residents rose 17 percent. The actual rate of growth was about 5 percent, if price increases were factored in. The consumer demand during the fourth quarter remained relatively high. All these would create a fairly strong pulling effect on the market price in 1994. 2. As seen from the financial and monetary situation, the new loans extended by the banks and the net money supply in 1993 greatly exceeded the targets of the state plan formulated at the beginning of the year. There was just too much currency on the market, which might bring out inflation at any time. Our past experience proved that excessive money supply in a certain year will affect not only the inflation rate of the same year, but also that in the next year. In forecasting the 1994 inflation, we must not only examine the plan for the supply of money in 1994, but also how much extra currency was put on the market beyond the state plan in 1993. 3. The financial situation brooks no optimism. Although the present financial situation has improved somewhat, state revenue is still relatively difficult. 4. The sharp price increases for energy and raw materials and the high costs of capital, foreign exchange and labor in the past two years have pushed up production costs, which in turn pushed up prices. Enterprises paid more than 30 percent for energy and raw materials they used in 1993 as compared with 1992. The cost of money rose 10 percent, while that of foreign exchange by over 20 percent. All these factors will inevitably push up production costs, and jack up the price. Due to the fact that the pressure of cost-push price rises is of a rigid nature, this pressure will not become lower in 1994. Nor will it decrease because of the macro-economic control. 5. While the economic growth was holding up, the market prices remained high because of the after-effect of the excessive currency on the market. 6. The situation in agriculture also brooks no optimism. Although the party central committee and the State Council attached great importance to agriculture, adopted many specific measures and policies to protect agricultural production, and attained some remarkable results in 1993, some factors which made agricultural production unstable still existed. These factors were as follows: (A) The acreage of farmland planted with grain, cotton and sugar-bearing crops declined. According to statistics, the total area planted with all kinds of crops in the whole country during 1993 was 1.28 million hectares or 0.9 percent less than that in 1992. (B) Investment in agriculture was awfully insufficient. (C) The growth rate of peasants' income remained low, and the gap between incomes of urban residents and those of peasants continued to widen. Whether agricultural production is stable or not and whether the supply of farm products is abundant or not would affect the market price. The situation in agriculture during 1993 will definitely affect the prices on the market in 1994. From an overall point of view, both positive and negative factors which will affect this year's market prices objectively exist. Will this year's market remain healthy? The key lies in whether we can exercise our macro-control appropriately. So long as we unify our thinking, face squarely at the existing problems at present, carry out our work in all fields ahead of schedule, we will be able to run our market healthily and head off serious inflation. III. Choices of Macro-Economic Control Policies for 1994 Market Price Regulation From the point of view of macro-economic policies, there are mainly three choices for 1994 market price regulation as follows: The first one is to adopt a overall deflationary macro-economic policy similar to the ones in 1988 and 1989. The advantage of this kind of policy is that it would quickly lower the excessively high commodity prices, but the disadvantage is that it would seriously hamper the normal economic growth. Meantime, it would make the market weak for a considerably longer period. The second one is to purely seek a high economic growth rate for a short period, and adopt a laissez-faire attitude to market price. At the end, it may bring about serious inflation. Finally measures must be taken to lower the rate of economic growth. This kind of economic fluctuations with drastic ups and downs will not only undermine the national economy, but also affect social stability. The third one is to adopt the "soft landing" macro-economic policy. That is to continuously strengthen and improve the macro-control over the national economy, and gradually lower the excessively high prices while maintaining a sustained, rapid and healthy economic development. We believe that the third choice is desirable, because the 1990s are the crucial years for the development of China's modernization program, and it is necessary to maintain a relatively high growth rate in developing the national economy. From the macro-economic policy point of view, we should pay attention to the following tasks in order to make sure that we have a healthy market in 1994: 1. Correctly handle the relation between the economic development, the reform program and price stabilization. It is necessary to exercise the macro-control appropriately and head off serious inflation, while maintaining a sustained and rapid development of the national economy. We should strive to control the rate of economic growth and the general index of price increases to approximately 10 percent, and pay attention to the following two cordons. The first one is that the growth rate of urban and rural residents' regular incomes should not be lower than the rate of price increases. The second one is to help residents prevent their savings from losing their value. The interest rate of their deposits must be higher than the rate of inflation. At the same time, it is essential to implement the price reform policy of combining relaxed control with readjustment and making steady advance; and do away with the practice of eagerly seeking quick results and scoring achievements with a single stroke. 2. The key to strengthening and improving macro-control lies in deepening reform. In the course of deepening reform, particular attention must be paid to making comprehensive use of finance, credit, interest rate, commodity price, taxation, wage and exchange rate as economic levers and to linking short-term readjustments with long-range reform measures. Meanwhile, efforts must be made to bring into full play the role of the State Planning Commission in working out overall plans. 3. Adopt positive measures, strengthen macro-control over investment in fixed assets and enthusiastically optimize the investment structure. (1) It is necessary to resolutely stop those projects which do not conform with the state industrial policy or those with unreliable or improper source of funds, those with neither prerequisites for construction nor definite future market in order to release some funds for the support of major construction projects. (2) It is essential to place the newly started projects under strict control. (3) Efforts must be made to resolutely strengthen the macro-control over the real estate business and the development zones. (4) It is necessary to further standardize the source of funds which are used in self-provided investments, and strengthen supervision and control over the use of foreign loans. (5) It is imperative to quicken the tempo in reforming the investment system, 4. Strengthen the control over the basic money supply from the central bank. 5. Lose no opportunity in promoting price reform, and maintain a sustained, rapid and healthy development of the national economy. The guiding ideology for carrying out the price reform in 1994 is to carry out the reform program in an appropriate manner, and actively and reliably promote the price reform while making sure that the general level of market prices in 1994 is lower than that in the previous year. The following measures should be carried out: (1) Further establish and improve the price mechanism with which the price should be regulated by the market.(2) Further improve the price system, raise the prices of basic industrial products and solve the problem of excessively low prices for basic industrial products in accordance with the requirements for the development of socialist market economy. It is necessary to appropriately and timely raise the price of farm products, rationally adjust the state-controlled prices of some of the farm products in order to create conditions to gradually decontrol the prices of such products. In the course of carrying out price reform on farm products, particular attention must be paid to protecting the interests of the peasants. 6. Improve the government system of exercising indirect macro-control over the market price. (1) It is necessary to gradually establish and improve the price control system at the central level and at the provincial, autonomous regional and municipal level. (2) It is essential to make comprehensive use of the economic, administrative and legal means to strengthen the administrative work in decontrolling the price. (3) Efforts must be made to establish the system of price regulation funds and the system for the storage of important commodities at the central and the local levels; and enhance the capability of the state in exercising macro-control over the market price. (4) It is necessary to further improve the inspection and alert system for market price regulation, and provide reliable information and data for making policy decisions on price formation and regulation. (5) It is essential to improve and work out laws and regulations for market price control. 7. Earnestly implement the policy and measures formulated by the central government on promoting agriculture and strive to stabilize agricultural production. As seen from the current situation, we should carry out the following tasks well: (1) We must firmly implement the various measures to stabilize and strengthen agricultural production after the meeting held by the party central committee on rural work. (2) We must continue to deepen reform in the countryside, regard market development as the main task and further improve the market system. We must strengthen our guidance in an overall manner, regard the protection of agriculture as our central task, and quicken our tempo in establishing a mechanism and an administrative system for the development of rural economy according to the requirements in building socialist market economy. (3) We must ensure that the governments at all levels spend more money in support of agricultural production. They must meet the urgent needs for the development of agriculture even if they have to temporarily postpone some of their industrial projects. We must appropriately raise the price of farm products in order to arouse the enthusiasm of the peasants in developing agricultural production.
