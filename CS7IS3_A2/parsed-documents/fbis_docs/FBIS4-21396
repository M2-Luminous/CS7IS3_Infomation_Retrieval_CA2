Successful though the use of these downstream treatment methods may be, the future of environmental engineering lies in preventive measures that avoid the occurrence of pollution from the outset. The new "Production-Integrated Environment Protection" funding program will support the development of industrial production methods that contribute to the avoidance of pollution at source, to the cyclic economy, and to resource conservation. The development and introduction of new production processes entails considerable expense and risk because radical changes in the production process are required without detriment to the quality of the end product. This is why industry is slow to adopt preventive technologies. Remedial measures still account for about 80 percent of environmental protection investment. However, it must be borne in mind that those who avoid environmental pollution today by adopting integrated environment protection technology, conserve resources by closing circuits, and recycle products that have outlived their usefulness will save on the expense of pollution disposal tomorrow. A whole series of pioneering solutions already available shows that ecological issues can be fully reconciled with economic considerations. Firms in the new federal laender have special opportunities for converting industrial production methods to take account of the environment, as the technologies of the future should be installed there from the outset to replace obsolete technologies and defunct markets. The process of building up new production capacities should take account of the principles of production-integrated environment protection for economic and ecological reasons, as this is where the decisive market advantages will lie in the long term. The "Production-Integrated Environment Protection" funding program is primarily directed at processes and products involving low-degradability or nondegradable substances or blends of substances. It seeks an integrated approach taking in the whole production process from raw material extraction to the treatment of unavoidable residues: -- Environment- and resource-conserving extraction of raw materials from the biosphere; -- Environment-friendly, low-waste and emission production processes achieved by replacing polluting raw and process materials, modifying the process technology, and closing the entire process circuit; -- Maximum recycling of production residues and reuse in other production processes (networking of production processes); -- Environment-compatible product design making for environment-friendly use, maintenance, and recycling or reprocessing, and -- Return to the biosphere of residues that cannot be recycled in an environment-compatible form achievable by pretreatment. Production process conversion will be backed up by ecobalances and product line analyses. The systematic closing of material circuits is expected to bring economic advantages as well. Product-integrated environment protection thus means the conservation of both economic and ecological resources. An annual appropriation of about 25 million German marks will be available for the implementation of the "Production-Integrated Environment Protection" funding program during the initial phase. A substantial increase in funding for this increasingly important area of environment protection research is expected in subsequent years.
