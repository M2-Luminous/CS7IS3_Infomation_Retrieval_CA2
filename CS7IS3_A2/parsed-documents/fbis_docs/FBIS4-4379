Following is a report by Kim Chin-sok from Chongwadae [presidential residence]: [Begin Kim Chin-sok recording] In a telephone conversation with President Clinton this morning, President Kim revealed that to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, close cooperation between the ROK and the United States and establishing a cooperative system with Japan are important, and that, if possible, it is necessary to make efforts for China to take part in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue. President Kim said that as revealed in the summit talks with President Jiang Zemin, he thinks that China will convey to North Korea that the ROK will not achieve reunification through the absorption of North Korea and that it has a firm will for maintaining peace. President Kim told President Clinton that cooperation with Russia is also necessary. President Kim said that in the ROK-China summit talks, President Jiang Zemin emphasized that China believes that security on the Korean peninsula is most important, and that to achieve this, dialogue between the parties concerned is very important. While denying that some reports are false, President Kim stressed that the issue of deploying Patriot missiles and the Team Spirit exercise were not mentioned at all in the ROK-China summit talks. In this connection, President Clinton said that he agrees that it is important to make efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue by obtaining cooperation from China. President Clinton said that there is no objection to the fact that the resolution of the nuclear issue through dialogue is the most desirable. He pointed out that it is difficult to hold dialogue because North Korea is not fulfilling its promises. President Clinton said that the U.S. Government thinks that it must continue to demand that North Korea receive sufficient inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency and resume North-South dialogue. He said that since it is not desirable to bring about a worst-case crisis regarding the North Korean nuclear issue, we must deal with this issue prudently and step by step. Today's telephone conversation started at 1000 [0100 GMT], lasting for 33 minutes. This has been Kim Chin-sok from Chongwadae. [end recording]
