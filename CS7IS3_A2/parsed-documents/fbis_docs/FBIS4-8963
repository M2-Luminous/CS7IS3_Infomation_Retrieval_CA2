Serious political forces do not enter into coalition agreements with parties that profess extremist principles, Ferenc Kulin says on the other hand. Istvan Csurka, co-chairman of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP], said at a recent political rally that, in a given situation, he also considers a coalition with the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] possible, provided that the MDF changes its political views. However, up to now, MDF Chairman Lajos Fur and MDF Managing Chairman Sandor Lezsak have both distanced themselves from the MIEP, because of Csurka's outbursts and extreme political views. We interviewed Lajos Horvath on the MIEP's coalition intentions. [Bercsi] The MIEP has recognized that the MDF-liberal bloc that came to power in 1990 is still holding out, but in the current situation the MDF is still less of an opponent because we have nothing to talk about with the liberals. The core of the popular-national tendency that was once grouped around Csurka is still present in the MDF. If the largest government party is indeed able to break with the former policies of Jozsef Antall, then we can again talk about possible coalition cooperation. [Bercsi] Lezsak denied that he and Csurka had conducted lengthy talks at the apartment of Sandor Csoori [chairman of the World Federation of Hungarians] on two occasions in recent weeks. [Horvath] I also asked Csurka and he denied news of these meetings. We have not held any kind of coordination talks with MDF leaders. [Bercsi] On what conditions would the MIEP be willing to work with the MDF? [Horvath] The Ministry of International Economic Relations should be turned into some kind of top ministry, which would also carry out the work of the Foreign Affairs Ministry. The MIEP does not agree with [Foreign Minister] Geza Jeszenszky's statements or the Hungarian foreign policy represented by him. In our view, the foreign minister should take our economic interests into consideration in our foreign relations. In addition to this, we would give much more freedom to the future representatives of Hungarian foreign policy. It is indispensable to change privatization fundamentally in Hungary, for which Minister Without Portfolio Tamas Szabo is unsuitable. We consider it important to change education because the awareness of being Hungarian has virtually been erased from the country's young people. [Kulin] I can only see Csurka's "offer" as a campaign trick. The MIEP has no other possibility to build its party but to win as many members from the MDF as it can. This intention has been foiled, so Csurka is now forced to try to blur the boundaries that he himself set up! It is clear that Csurka is still trying to win the less determined MDF sympathizers over, people who are not clear about relations between the MDF and the MIEP. These people might as well believe, listening to Csurka's statements that, if the MDF and the MEIP join in a coalition in the future, then why not vote for Csurka? The only unfortunate factor is that the votes cast for the MIEP will probably be wasted because there seems to be little chance for the MIEP to reach the 5 percent necessary to get into Parliament. [Bercsi] Would the MDF accept the MIEP's approach if it got into Parliament? [Kulin] The foreign policy programs of the leading Hungarian political parties -- including, naturally, the MDF -- all intend to form optimal relations with the Eastern Central European countries and, in addition to this, integration into Western Europe is the primary goal. However, the MIEP is a political obstacle and a drawback to this, so I believe that truly serious political forces will not enter into coalition agreements with parties that profess extremist principles. At the same time, Csurka is ignoring all written and verbal rules of political ethics in all respects: For a whole year, in a most merciless fashion, he has been attacking the MDF's foreign and domestic policies that had been formed by Antall.
