Geroski: "Did Tirana `Turn its Back' on Taci?"] [Text] After several months of turmoil within the PDP [Party for Democratic Prosperity] that resulted into a definite split and separation of the leadership headed by Djeladin Murati and the faction of Menduh Taci and Arben Djaferi, there appear to have been no major events within this party for some time. The PDP Central Assembly session of "continuity" and the unexpected and easily banned Tetovo meeting of Taci's faction did not point to any essential changes in the positions of the two wings. Statement Nevertheless, last week an event that can be seen as a relevant change in the stance of official Tirana toward the PDP took place. At the meeting with the CSCE head of mission in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], Norman Anderson, Albanian President Sali Berisha stated he was convinced that "with their participation in the government, with the loyalty that they demonstrated to the coalition, and the democratic methods that they have adopted for the consolidation of their human and national rights, the Albanians will always be the stability factor." In his discussions with Anderson, Berisha reiterated the struggle for the consolidation of the rights of the Albanians in Macedonia, for holding the census and so on, however, the definition of their participation in the government and the loyalty to the coalition as a factor of stability in the state (a long termed goal of Albania) can be seen as nothing but an implicit support to the delegate and ministerial PDP elite. There are speculations that this new stance of Tirana, compared to the recent one by which it openly supported Taci's faction, caused serious confusions within the ranks of the faction. Now Tirana is moving Taci toward direct cooperation with the government, urging him to take actions within the institutional framework, which is totally opposite to the recent statements of the faction's leader. If we have accurately registered the symptomatic and depressive words of the young Taci that he "has had enough of policy," then we can explain them only in the context of the new sounds arriving from Tirana. Namely, by everything that has been stated so far by this self-conscious politician, it is now really necessary to make a major in order to make the "big jump" and chart a new political course. Determination After the definite statement of the competent bodies related to the "inheritance" of the PDP in favor of Murati's leadership, it became clear that Taci's faction does not have a chance of entering the elections unless it registers itself as a separate (new) party. For the time being, the faction does not have the will to do that, and even if it does, it will have difficulties registering due to its party program. The only chance of participation in the government and of making constructive efforts for consolidation of the position of the Albanians in Macedonia is by betting on the people of the delegate-ministerial elite. Of course, Tirana will not make such a turn around and openly support the present team of Albanian politicians involved in the government (it is not out of the question, according to the "hot-cold" system, that we can be once again surprised by them if they give support to those who were, until only yesterday, their disciples). However, Berisha has openly supported those who participate and will participate in the government, probably aware that Taci has no chance of winning.
