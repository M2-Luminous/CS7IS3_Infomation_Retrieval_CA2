On 31 December, 185,216 people were out of work, which is the highest number of unemployed since March 1992. Compared with the situation at the end of November, there were 9,500 (5.38 percent) more unemployed, while, compared with the same period of 1992, there were 50,400 more unemployed. Some 31,944 people came onto the labor offices' registers in December, which is 6,900 newly registered job seekers fewer that at the end of November. Only 22,500 job seekers came off the labor offices' registers; of these, 15,600 (69.3 percent) were placed in employment, 2,700 (12.0 percent) were struck off the register for not observing the conditions for cooperation with the labor offices, and the remaining 4,200 (18.7 percent) came off the register for other reasons. The number of labor offices that, during December, recorded a drop in the number of registered job seekers has declined. Only six labor offices (Prague-West, Ceske Budejovice, Usti nad Labem, Jablonec nad Nisou, Prague, and Beroun) recorded a drop in the number of job seekers between - 3.8 percent and - 0.1 percent. The month-to-month increase in unemployment in the other labor offices hovered between 0.05 percent in the Blansko District and 17.2 percent in Cheb. The number of people receiving benefits prior to entering into employment was 93,380 on 31 December 1993, which is 50.4 percent of the overall number of unplaced job seekers. The level of unemployment, calculated as a percentage of the number of registered job seekers in the overall available work force, was 3.52 percent on 31 December, which was the highest figure recorded in 1993. Compared with the same period last year, this is 0.95 percentage points more and, compared with September 1993, it is 0.35 percentage points more. Unemployment rose in all regions of the republic except Prague (stagnation). The highest level is still in North Moravia (6.16 percent), where, of the 10 districts, only Olomouc recorded an unemployment level under 5.0 percent. Only in Prague and the Cheb District was the level of unemployment under 1.0 percent in December (0.34 percent and 0.68 percent respectively). It was more than 5.0 percent in 22 districts and more than 7.0 percent in seven districts. The highest level of unemployment was in the Znojmo District (8.52 percent) and in Bruntal (8.7 percent). The number of vacancies has continued to decline in contrast to the rising number of unplaced job seekers. On 31 December 1993, there were 53,938 vacancies on offer at labor offices, which is 1,100 fewer than in November and 25,500 fewer than during the same period of 1992. The supply and demand situation for vacancies is different in individual regions of the Czech Republic. While in Prague at the end of December there were almost six vacancies per job seeker; in North Moravia, the demand for vacancies exceeded supply almost 12 times and in South Moravia 6.5 times. The average for the Czech Republic as a whole was 3.4 job seekers per vacancy. [passage omitted]
