A coup d'etat? [Ruego] Our primary goal is to restore order, to restablish the constitutional state, security for everyone. After that we will adhere to the principles of the Arusha Accords. We do not wish to seize power just for its own sake. [Dewin] But is this possible after everything that happened?" [Ruego] It is always possible. [Dewin] After all the massacres between the Hutus and Tutsis? [Ruego] Yes, even after the massacres we are ready to apply the greater principles, such as national unity, and a government on a broad basis, etc. But, of course there will be, I think, some changes. [Dewin] The question remains of who was behind the attack on the presidents? Was the RPF involved in that? [Ruego] Not at all. We applied to the letter everything we were asked to do. [Dewin] Nevertheless, it will be very difficult. [Ruego] As a matter of fact, we do not have the intention to talk to these commanders of massacres. It is not to them that we will talk, but to the political parties with whom we had already started negotiating.
