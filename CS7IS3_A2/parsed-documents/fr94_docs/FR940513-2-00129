SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to section 3406(c)(1) of the CVPIA, an EIS will be prepared which will evaluate the environmental effects of the alternative ways of implementing the measures developed in the CP. The CP will address fish, wildlife, and habitat concerns on the San Joaquin River including but not limited to the improvements that would be needed to reestablish where necessary and sustain naturally reproducing anadromous fisheries from Friant Dam to its confluence with the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary. It will be developed in cooperation with the California Department of Fish and Game and in coordination with the San Joaquin River Management Program under development by the State of California. It will incorporate, among other relevant factors, the potential contributions of tributary streams as well as the alternatives being investigated in the course of preparing the Stanislaus River Basin and Calaveras River Water Use Program EIA/Environmental Impact Report, currently underway pursuant to CVPIA section 3406(c)(2). The alternatives will be developed during the scoping and planning process and will be evaluated in the environmental documentation. The range of alternatives will include No Action. The CP and draft EIS are expected to be completed and available for review and comment early in 1996. The data generated pursuant to other CVPIA activities may be used in the development of the CP and EIS. The data developed and analyzed in the CP and EIS may be used in the Friant Water Contract Renewal process pursuant to CVPIA section 3404(c)(1) at some future date. Note: Anyone requiring special accommodations should contact Valerie Curley at the above phone number. Please call as far in advance of the meetings as possible, and no later than June 6, 1994, to enable the agencies to meet your needs. If a request cannot be honored, the requester will be notified.
