Despite the fact that these were European elections, the Socialists admit that they have received a serious warning from the electorate, and that its consequences for domestic policy are inevitable. [Correspondent Alicia Montano] Twelve years after taking power the PSOE is facing its first election defeat on a national scale. Since 1982 the party has been the one to receive the most votes and on three occasions has had an absolute majority. Now it knows that the 12 June results are a serious warning from the electorate from which they are prepared to draw conclusions. This is what the party's leaders admitted no sooner than the first results were known and this position was ratified this morning by the party's Executive Committee. In its first analysis, the PSOE leadership admitted that the corruption cases and the economic crisis have taken part of the PSOE vote to United Left or abstention. The Socialists trust that once these two problems have been tackled the hopes of its electorate will be rekindled. The PSOE believes that this is not the time to bring forward elections but to support the government and its stability. [Begin recording, Cipria Ciscar, PSOE secretary for organization] The Socialist Party leadership, during its meeting today, is completely united around the leadership of Secretary General Felipe Gonzalez, and in its support for the government that we, the Socialists, are obliged to continue with, maintain, in fulfillment of the will of the people expressed in the 1993 general elections. [end recording] [Montano] Some leaders, such as Juan Carlos Rodriguez Ibarra [prime minister of the Extremadura regional government], said that the Socialist defeat was as logical as it was painful because things were done so badly. They recalled the damage that cases such as that of Mariano Rubio and Luis Roldan have done. There are those who believe that the disaffection of part of the electorate has its roots in those who call for the party to shift left and, therefore, believe that it is necessary to improve relations with the trade unions. What remains to be seen now is if yesterday's results will serve to bind together the different factions within the Socialist Party or whether, on the contrary, it will heighten their differences. What they all agree on is that the electorate has again sent a clear message.
