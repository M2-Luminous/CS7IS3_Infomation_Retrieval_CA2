FR940406-1-00011 FR940406-1-00003 The FAA estimates that approximately 10,200 airplanes in the U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take approximately 40 workhours per airplane to accomplish the proposed action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Parts cost approximately $500 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $27,540,000. AD 57&hyph;18&hyph;01 and AD 87&hyph;20&hyph;02 R1, which both would be superseded by the proposed action, currently require the same actions as are proposed. This proposed action incorporates and updates the procedures of both the current AD's into one document. With this in mind, the proposed action would not provide any additional cost impact upon U.S. operators than that which is already required. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action has been placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. 2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing both AD 57&hyph;18&hyph;01, Amendment 39&hyph;1759, and AD 87&hyph;20&hyph;02 R1, Amendment 39&hyph;5944, and by adding a new airworthiness directive to read as follows: Beech Aircraft Corporation: Docket No. 93&hyph;CE&hyph;37&hyph;AD. Supersedes AD 57&hyph;18&hyph;01, Amendment 39&hyph;1759, and AD 87&hyph;20&hyph;02 R1, Amendment 39&hyph;5944. Applicability: 1. Models 35, 35R, A35, B35, C35, D35, E35, F35, G35, H35, J35, K35, M35, N35, and P35 airplanes (all serial numbers), certificated in any category; 2. Models S35, V35, V35A, and V35B airplanes (all serial numbers), certificated in any category, that do not have the straight tail conversion modification incorporated in accordance with Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) SA2149CE; and 3. Model Super V airplanes (all serial numbers), certificated in any category. Compliance: Required initially within the next 100 hours time-in-service (TIS) after the effective date of this AD, unless already accomplished, and thereafter as indicated in the body of this AD. To prevent structural failure of the V-tail, which could result in loss of control of the airplane, accomplish the following: Note 1: Any of the actions specified by this AD may have already been accomplished in accordance with either AD 57&hyph;18&hyph;01 and AD 87&hyph;20&hyph;02 R1, which are superseded by this AD. The intent of this AD is to clarify, update, and incorporate the actions of those AD's into one AD while maintaining the repetitive inspections schedules already established by the superseded AD's. Note 2: The paragraph structure of this AD is as follows: Level 1: (a), (b), (c), etc. Level 2: (1), (2), (3), etc. Level 3: (i), (ii), (iii), etc. Level 2 and Level 3 structures are designations of the Level 1 paragraph they immediately follow. (a) For all airplane models, balance the elevator/rudder (ruddervator) control surfaces in accordance with Section 3 of Beech Shop Manual 35&hyph;590096B; and verify that the ruddervators are within the manufacturers specified limits as specified in the applicable shop or maintenance manual. (1) If any ruddervator is found outside of the specified limits, prior to further flight, obtain manufacturer's modification instructions by contacting the Wichita Aircraft Certification Office (ACO) at the address specified in paragraph (k) of this AD, and modify the ruddervator in accordance with these instructions. (2) Repeat these requirements any time the ruddervator is repaired or painted. (b) For all airplane models, visually inspect the fuselage bulkheads at Fuselage Station (FS) 256.9 and FS 272 for damage (cracks, distortion, loose rivets, etc.). Visually inspect the fuselage skin around the bulkhead for damage (wrinkles or cracks). Prior to further flight, repair or replace any damaged parts. Repeat this inspection at each 100-hour TIS interval thereafter.
