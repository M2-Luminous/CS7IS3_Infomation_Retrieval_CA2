With the division headed by Thierry Breton, the French computer manufacturer sets up a European structure dedicated to multiplatform outsourcing. Named Athesa International, it will become operational on 1 January 1993. It is a holding company in which Bull owns 51 percent of the capital, the amount of which was not made public. The remaining shares will be held by industrial or bank partners; their names will be known "by the end of the year," according to Jacques Tordjman, the former CEO of EDS France who is now president of Athesa International. The holding company will own a 50-percent interest in Athesa France (the other half being owned by CISI); Athesa France will bring together Bull's FM activities (its Methods and Information Processing subsidiary as well as the Groupama backup center running on GCos8 and managed by Bull) and part of Cisi Telematics. The SSII [data-processing services and engineering company] will also contribute its FM contract with the CEA on IBM and Cray platforms, i.e. the equivalent of Fr70 million per year. Athesa France will have 650 employees (two thirds from CISI, one third from Bull) and is already worth about Fr400 million. At international level, Athesa will control 100 percent of Athesa TSP (Technical Support and Partners), which will manage Bull's data-processing centers (and those of the holding company's future partners) at European level, i.e. the equivalent of a contract worth at least Fr500 million. According to Jacques Tordjman, sales should reach Fr1.2 billion next year and Fr3 billion by 1995, with a 10 percent pre-tax margin.
