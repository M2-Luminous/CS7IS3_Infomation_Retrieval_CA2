I am optimistic -- Krajisnik said in his statement today to Jagodina Radio -- as I believe that the international community will realize that the Serbs have accepted everything that is required of them. "We have agreed to the proposal that Sarajevo be placed under UN administration; we have accepted an agreement on the future organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina; we have signed with the Croat side an agreement on the cessation of hostilities until political solutions are found; we have agreed that our aircraft should not fly over Bosnia-Herzegovina; and finally, we have agreed that our weaponry be placed under UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] control." "All this must be enough for the international community to realize who is cooperative and which side wants to put an end to the war as soon as possible. This is why I am positive that the European Union [EU] and the United Nations will find a diplomatic solution which will avert NATO's threat to bomb Serb positions. Otherwise such an act would be the grossest crime in the 20th century in Europe, as aggression would be committed at a time when the two warring parties, the Serbs and Muslims, have signed a cease-fire, and when there are no combat actions in this area." Asked whether heavy weaponry would be removed 20 kilometers from Sarajevo or placed under UNPROFOR control, Krajisnik said: "NATO demands that we withdraw our heavy artillery by 20 kilometers from Sarajevo is in fact demanding that Serb units be disarmed. At the same time this means that the Serb side should abandon its centuries-old ethnic lands and hand over Sarajevo to the Muslim republic. We do not accept this as this amounts to capitulation. We are nevertheless willing to allow UNPROFOR representatives to control our heavy weaponry, which would guarantee that there would be no combat activities from our positions," Momcilo Krajisnik told Jagodina Radio.
