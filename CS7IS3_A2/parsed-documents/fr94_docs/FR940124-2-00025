ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Overlook, Incorporated (Applicant) has applied to the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) for an incidental take permit pursuant to Section 10(a) of the Endangered Species Act (Act). The Applicant has been assigned Permit Number PRT&hyph;782824. The requested permit, which is for a period not to exceed 30 years, would authorize the incidental take of the endangered golden-cheeked warbler ( Dendroica chrysoparia ). The proposed take would occur as a result of the construction and operation of a residential development on a 213 acre tract in Austin, Travis County, Texas. The Service has prepared an environment assessment (EA) for the incidental take application. A determination of jeopardy to the species or a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) will not be made before 30 days from the date of publication of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to Section 10(c) of the Act and National Environmental Policy Act regulations (40 CFR 1506.6). DATES: Written comments on the application and EA should be received on February 23, 1994. ADDRESSES: Persons wishing to review the application may obtain a copy by writing to the Assistant Regional Director, Ecological Services, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, P.O. Box 1306, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87103. Persons wishing to review the EA may obtain a copy by contacting Robert B. Simpson, Ecological Services Field Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 611 East Sixth Street, suite 407, Austin, Texas 78701 (512) 482&hyph;5436.

Please refer to Permit Number PRT&hyph;782824 when submitting comments. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert B. Simpson at the above Austin Ecological Service Filed Office address. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 9 of the Act prohibits the ``Taking'' of any endangered species, including the golden-cheeked warbler. However, the Service, under limited circumstances, may issue permits to take endangered wildlife species if such taking is incidental to, and not the purpose of otherwise lawful activities. Regulations governing permits for endangered species are at 50 CFR 17.22. The Applicant plans to build a residential development on a 213 acre tract on RR2222 at Far West Blvd., west of Austin, Travis County, Texas. The development will occupy approximately 86.84 acres including 10.58 acres of impervious cover (i.e., streets, rooftops and driveways) with the remaining 126.16 acres proposed as conservation areas. These activities will permanently eliminate about 86.84 acres of occupied and/or potential endangered species habitat. The applicant proposed to mitigate the incidental take via dedicating 126.16 acres for open space, and providing sufficient money to purchase land containing six golden-cheeked warbler territories adjacent to, or within, a preserve that is managed for the warbler, and money, or other compensation, to operate and manage those lands for the life of the permit. The Applicant considered five alternatives but rejected four of them because they were not economically viable. James A. Young, Assistant Regional Director, Ecological Services, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Southwest Region (2), Albuquerque, New Mexico.
