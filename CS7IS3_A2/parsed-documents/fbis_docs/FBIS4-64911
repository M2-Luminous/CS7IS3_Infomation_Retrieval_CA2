Juppe, speaking on French radio, said such an intervention would involve too many risks and added that the diplomatic channel would bear better results. He warned, however, that the safety of the 11 detainees from the Premiere Urgence (First Emergency) humanitarian organisation was the responsibility of authorities in the rump-Yugoslavia and Bosnian Serbs. "We are not negotiating," he said. "We demand their unconditional release. The Serbs must realize that if they persevere with their defiant attitude toward the international community, they will pay the price." The French aid workers have been held since April 8 at Lukavica, a suburb of Sarajevo, on charges that they were smuggling arms to the mostly Moslem Bosnian Army. The Serbs say they intend to try the 11, who face up to 15 years in prison. Premiere Urgence has denied the arms smuggling charges and says weapons allegedly found at a Serb checkpoint in one of the organization's trucks had been planted there by the Serbs themselves.
