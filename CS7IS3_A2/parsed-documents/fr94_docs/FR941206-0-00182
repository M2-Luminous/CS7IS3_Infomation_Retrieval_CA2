FR941206-0-00182 FR941206-0-00019 (f) Each cover opening shall be secured in a closed, sealed position (e.g., covered by a gasketed lid) at all times that hazardous waste is in the tank except when it is necessary to use the cover opening to: (1) Add, remove, inspect, or sample the material in the tank; (2) Inspect, maintain, repair, or replace equipment located inside the tank; or (3) Vent gases or vapors from the tank to a closed-vent system connected to a control device that is designed and operated in accordance with the requirements of §264.1087 of this subpart. (g) One or more safety devices which vent directly to the atmosphere may be used on the tank, cover, closed-vent system, or control device provided each safety device meets all of the following conditions: (1) The safety device is not used for planned or routine venting of organic vapors from the tank or closed-vent system connected to a control device; and (2) The safety device remains in a closed, sealed position at all times except when an unplanned event requires that the device open for the purpose of preventing physical damage or permanent deformation of the tank, cover, closed-vent system, or control device in accordance with good engineering and safety practices for handling flammable, combustible, explosive, or other hazardous materials. An example of an unplanned event is a sudden power outage. §264.1085 Standards: Surface impoundments. (a) This section applies to owners and operators of surface impoundments subject to this subpart into which any hazardous waste is placed except for the following surface impoundments: (1) A surface impoundment in which all hazardous waste entering the surface impoundment meets the conditions specified in §264.1082(c) of this subpart; or (2) A surface impoundment used for biological treatment of hazardous waste in accordance with the requirements of §264.1082(c)(2)(iv) of this subpart. (b) The owner or operator shall place the hazardous waste into a surface impoundment equipped with a cover (e.g., an air-supported structure or a rigid cover) that is vented through a closed-vent system to a control device meeting the requirements specified in paragraph (d) of this section. (c) As an alternative to complying with paragraph (b) of this section, an owner or operator may place hazardous waste in a surface impoundment equipped with a floating membrane cover meeting the requirements specified in paragraph (e) of this section when the hazardous waste is determined to meet all of the following conditions: (1) The hazardous waste is neither mixed, stirred, agitated, nor circulated within the surface impoundment by the owner or operator using a process that results in splashing, frothing, or visible turbulent flow on the waste surface during normal process operations; (2) The hazardous waste in the surface impoundment is not heated by the owner or operator; and (3) The hazardous waste is not treated by the owner or operator using a waste stabilization process or a process that produces an exothermic reaction. (d) To comply with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or operator shall design, install, operate, and maintain a cover that vents the organic vapors emitted from hazardous waste in the surface impoundment through a closed- vent system connected to a control device. (1) The cover shall be designed and operated to meet the following requirements: (i) The cover and all cover openings (e.g., access hatches, sampling ports, and gauge wells) shall be designed to operate with no detectable organic emissions when all cover openings are secured in a closed, sealed position. (ii) Each cover opening shall be secured in the closed, sealed position (e.g., covered by a gasketed lid or cap) at all times that hazardous waste is in the surface impoundment except as provided for in paragraph (g) of this section. (iii) The closed-vent system and control device shall be designed and operated in accordance with §264.1087 of this subpart. (e) To comply with paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator shall design, install, operate, and maintain a floating membrane cover that meets all of the requirements specified in 40 CFR 265.1086(e)(1) through (e)(4). (f) The owner or operator shall install, operate, and maintain enclosed pipes or other closed-systems, EPA considers a drain system that meets the requirements of 40 CFR 61.346(a)(1) or 40 CFR 61.346(b)(1) through (b)(3) to be a ``closed system'', to: (1) Transfer all hazardous waste to the surface impoundment from another tank, surface impoundment, or container subject to this subpart except for those hazardous wastes that meet the conditions specified in §264.1082(c) of this subpart; and (2) Transfer all hazardous waste from the surface impoundment to another tank, surface impoundment, or container subject to this subpart except for those hazardous wastes that meet the conditions specified in §264.1082(c) of this subpart. (g) Each cover opening shall be secured in the closed, sealed position (e.g., a cover by a gasketed lid or cap) at all times that hazardous waste is in the surface impoundment except when it is necessary to use the cover opening to: (1) Add, remove, inspect, or sample the material in the surface impoundment; (2) Inspect, maintain, repair, or replace equipment located underneath the cover; (3) Remove treatment residues from the surface impoundment in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 268.4; or (4) Vent gases or vapors from the surface impoundment to a closed-vent system connected to a control device that is designed and operated in accordance with the requirements of §264.1087 of this subpart.
