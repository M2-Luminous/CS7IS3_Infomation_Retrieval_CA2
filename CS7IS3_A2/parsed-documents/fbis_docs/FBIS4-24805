A review of the internal and external factors regulating economic returns shows that "market inflexibility syndrome" on part of enterprises has emerged as a major factor. The newspaper ZHONGGUO XINXI BAO run by the State Statistical Bureau carried a report on this recently. The said research report maintains that in recent years, in the wake of the full progress of the reform of the economic structure on all fronts and the enforcement of the relevant regulations, the regulatory function of market mechanisms has increased every day. An investigation conducted in 1991 by the department concerned into the cause of losses in 50 enterprises in the three cities of Beijing, Shenyang, and Tianjin revealed that three categories of factors--those related to policies, macroeconomic operations, and enterprise operations and management were responsible for 19.4, 47.8, and 32.8 percent of the cases respectively. Another investigation conducted last year by the department concerned into the cause of losses in more than 2,500 enterprises in eight provinces and cities, including Shanghai, Shandong, and Jilin, showed that the number of cases due to factors related to policies and macroeconomic operations had both been reduced to around 9 percent, whereas the number of cases due to factors related to enterprise operations and management had risen drastically to 82 percent. This change indicates that poor management and market inflexibility on the part of enterprises themselves have emerged as the major factors affecting their economic returns.
