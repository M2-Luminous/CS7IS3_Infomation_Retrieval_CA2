The Finance Ministry [MOF] cannot begin to formulate the budget unless a specific framework of economic stimulus measures being worked out by the Economic Planning Agency is made clear, Saito told a press conference. The third extra budget will be formed to finance additional public works projects and other fiscal steps expected in the pump-priming package to help the Japanese economy out of the long slump. Saito avoided comment on whether or not his ministry will allow issuance of deficit-covering government bonds to fund proposed income tax cuts. The MOF will respect the conclusion on the matter to be made by a joint economic forum between the government and ruling coalition parties, he said. The ministry, which had been adamant about hiking the consumption tax to offset income tax cuts and against the issuance of deficit-covering bonds, reportedly softened its stance on the issue recently.
