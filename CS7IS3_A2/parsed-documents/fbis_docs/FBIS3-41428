Bulgaria can carry out construction work in Russia, in return for which they could accept our waste nuclear fuel at a more acceptable price. The Russians refused to accept radioactive waste in 1988, since when we have been stockpiling it in a temporary store. According to our contract with the former USSR, they should take back the fuel free of charge as long as we have nuclear plants. They have agreed to accept the fuel at a price of $1,016 per kilogram, which will cost us $22 million per year. An alternative is to store the waste fuel in special containers near Kozloduy. These containers would cost us $20 million until the year 2000. So far, the most acceptable offer that we have received for storing the waste in Bulgaria is $60 million, which was offered by the U.S.-French consortium Framatom-Nuclear Pacific.
