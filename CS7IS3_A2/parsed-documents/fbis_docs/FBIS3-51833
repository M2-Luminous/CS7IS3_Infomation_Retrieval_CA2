FBIS3-51833 "drlat017_a_94008" FBIS-LAT-94-017 Document Type:Daily Report 26 January 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Roundup: Criminal, Judicial Action 18 to 25 Jan FL2501152894 FL2501152894 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of fileworthy reports on criminal activity and related judicial actions in Cuba carried on Havana radio and television in Spanish between 18 and 25 January. Havana Cuba Vision at 0100 GMT on 18 January reports that in what police are calling the "Caramel Case," two managers at Coppelia Ice Cream Palace forced workers to reduce the amount of the servings and were pilfering one of every two or three vats of ice cream, which they sold on the black market for 300 pesos. Workers who protested were fired. This pilfering resulted in the center having to close early and serving only half its usual 12,000 customers a day. Steps have been taken to remedy the situation, the result of highly deficient organization. Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks in Spanish at 0100 GMT on 22 January report that the National Revolutionary Police have arrested seven people in Marianao, Havana, for illegal acquisition of imported goods, i.e., 60,000 bars of soap obtained through impersonation of representatives of two bogus foreign enterprises. The soap was sold on the black market but an official who refused a 100,000-peso bribe alerted authorities. Marianao's Unified Vigilance and Protection System also deserves praise for its role in the arrests. Reporter Jorge Roco stresses that personal irresponsibility and faulty sale procedures caused Cuba to lose money instead of profiting, besides exacerbating the excess currency situation. Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 24 January reports that nine 100- pound barrels of margarine oil were stolen from the Siboney candy store in Playa Municipality by former worker Jose Miguel Herrera Jimenez and Ricardo Manuel Ruiz Silva, a worker at the National Geology Institute. During the course of the robbery, Herrera murdered a night shift worker. An additional 17 people have been arrested for aiding and abetting the crime. The oil, officially worth a total of 300 pesos, was sold for 3,000 pesos a barrel. Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 25 January reports that a Havana court has tried two men for embezzlement at Bacuranao Pasteurizing Plant, which lost over 20,000 pesos. The accused, who have a prior criminal record, worked as port and distribution chiefs. The investigation revealed that one man received over 9,000 liters of milk to be sold in the black market. A police investigator stressed that it is very difficult to fight crime when those in charge of the people's resources have criminal records and work in distribution.
