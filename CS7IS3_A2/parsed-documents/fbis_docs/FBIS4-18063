As chairman of the fifth State Duma in Russia's history, I express -- I do not hide -- my profound satisfaction at the signing of this treaty. Ever since it started its work the Duma has actively and consistently advocated the achievement of civic peace and accord in our society, regarding it as fundamentally important and extremely necessary. Though not going the full way, perhaps, to meeting our needs, it is indispensable in overcoming the crisis and bringing about the genuine revival of Russia. When the State Duma adopted the memorandum on accord on 23 February this year, a new stage, basically, was initiated in the relationship between the authorities and public organizations in our country. It created the prerequisites for ending the state of political sectarianism, which is unnatural in a parliamentary democracy, for ending the division of society into reds and whites, into them and us, into radicals and conservatives. Our society can see for itself that confrontation offers nothing, that confrontation and violence create far more problems than they resolve. People are tired of empty promises. But they are even more weary of intrigue, ambition, and uncertainty about the present and especially the future. While welcoming the signing of the treaty, I cannot fail to stress that this is not a panacea for all our problems, but the extent of the treaty's force is strictly limited by the law and social practice. Perhaps this is where its moral and ethical aspect, authority, lies. Our age-old tradition of solving problems all together [vsem mirom] is being revived. There are differing attitudes in contemporary Russian society to the present treaty. But it is in the interests of accord not to dramatize the situation. Let us be wise and patient. Different assessments reflect profound social differences and disagreements which cannot be overcome at one go. We are dutybound to listen to different views and positions, to heed the anguish and alarm which they reflect, while specific objectives in ending the crisis and seeking realistic mechanisms for settling real contradictions are worked out. One other thing is obvious. No matter how the programs of those taking part in the treaty may differ, they are close to each other in that they agree on the main thing. Society must be relieved of the burden of social tension. Normal relations between the branches of power must develop on the basis of unconditional observance of law and order. After all, separation of the powers certainly does not mean alienation from each other, let alone confrontation. Our routes must meet at a crossroads. The country's statehood must be transformed into something which benefits Russia and its citizens. The economic reforms must be deepened in the interests of the entire people rather than those of some small select group of people. The democratic thrust of foreign policy must be safeguarded, while ensuring that the national distinctiveness and geopolitical interests of Russia are rigorously observed. We all need these things very much, and it is important to think on the fact that the time has come not to hack as we used to do before, but to patiently and knowingly untie the Gordian knots into which Russian problems have become knotted. Of course, the path toward the accord is thorny and long. Today we are merely taking the first step on this path. Our ancient ancestors used to say: He who has begun something has already half done it. I subscribe to what Boris Nikolayevich said. The main thing is to win the struggle within ourselves, and then at a certain stage we can recall the words of the unforgettable Konstantin Simonov, who said some time ago: Yes, we did not gain the victory easily. Yes, our enemy -- our internal enemy -- was strong. The greater is our glory. Thank you.
