This incident has caused a great uproar in the U.S. Government and among the public. In particular, the U.S. Congress sternly criticized Yeltsin, who is relying on U.S. political and economic support, for his hypocrisy and maliciousness in stabbing Clinton in the back. Secretary of State Christopher gave a serious warning, saying that this kind of practice was unacceptable. All of a sudden, apart from the discord sown by the Bosnia question, Russo-American relations have once again turned to a low ebb because of the Russian spy case. Now, what must be seen is whether or not the United States will accept Congress' view and take retaliatory action? How will they retaliate? What impact will the retaliation have? The Russian Government was embarrassed by the revelation, but, at the same time, it openly admitted the issue and stressed that this was an ordinary matter which should not be overstated. Russia also hit back at the United States by saying that U.S. espionage against Russia has never stopped, but is as intense as during the Cold War era. Hence, Russia urged the United States not to exaggerate the case as if it was a political incident and not to "revert to the psychology of the Cold War, since making use of the espionage issue to vigorously stir up trouble is against the spirit of international partnership." (Yeltsin's press secretary Kostikov) Ames, the arrested Russian spy inside the CIA, started working in the CIA in 1983 [date as published] and was the CIA's counter-narcotics section chief. Since 1985, from the time of the former Soviet Union until recently, including the period when the Soviet Union dissolved and Yeltsin assumed office, Ames had been passing secret information on U.S. espionage activities against the former Soviet Union and Russia and received $1.5 million from the former Soviet Union and his Russian contacts. Movie-Like Trick Used To Pass Information Two years ago, the FBI started a secret investigation into Ames' suspicious activities and discovered that, when Ames had gone secretly to Venezuela and Columbia in South America on counter- narcotics investigations, he had seized the opportunity to contact intelligence agents of the former Soviet Union and Russia. Ames also marked a post box in suburban Washington and dropped pieces of information so that other Russian spies could secretly find them by following the clue. The trick was like something from the movies. The Clinton administration was shamed into anger after the case was revealed. Apart from lodging a formal protest with Russia, the U.S. Government also asked a Russian diplomat at the Russian Embassy in the United States, who was known to be directing Ames' activities, to voluntarily leave the country. Difficult To Build Relations of Mutual Trust Of those people whose identities as U.S. agents were betrayed by Ames to the former Soviet Union and Russia, 10 were executed. In this connection, the United States considered it intolerable and suggested that retaliatory action ought to be taken. This incident has been revealed at a time when the Cold War has ended and when the two former enemies of the United States and Russia have become allies. The KGB of the former Soviet Union has ceased all of its activities and the CIA no longer considers Russia as its biggest prospective enemy. However, the Russian spy case has precisely emerged at a time when the two countries are jointly greeting the 21st century, and both sides feel that it is difficult to explain away this case to their peoples and to the world. (Stiaposen), first deputy chief of the "Russia Federal Counterintelligence Bureau," said at a press conference in Moscow as early as last month that, although the Cold War had ended, foreign espionage in Russia had never abated. In particular, U.S. and British intelligence agents have been capitalizing on Russia's economic difficulties to recruit a large number of Russians, including officials, to gather information for the United States and Europe. Over the past year, a total of 20 Russians recruited by the CIA have been arrested. He said that Yeltsin was aware of these cases. The United States and Western Europe were displeased with Russia's announcement that it was to interfere and send troops to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Now, the Russian spy case will make it more difficult for the United States and Russia to build relations of mutual trust.
