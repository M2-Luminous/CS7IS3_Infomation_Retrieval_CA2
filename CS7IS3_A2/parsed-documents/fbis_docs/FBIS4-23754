The three ANC members in the executive committee of KwaZulu/Natal today agreed to boycott meetings of the provincial legislature in Ulundi. This follows the Inkatha Freedom Party's choice of Ulundi as capital. The ANC alliance and the National Party prefer Pietermaritzburg. The province's premier, Mr. Frank Mdlalose, said the problem will be discussed at a session of the provincial parliament later this month in Ulundi. [Begin Mdlalose recording, in English] It will not be the determination of a capital itself on those days, but it will be the way to go about it. You will realize that there could be a number of things, for example, it could be by referendum which would have, of course, its own implications. It could also be by way of a commission that would look into the whole issue and report back either to the cabinet or to the parliament of KwaZulu/Natal. [end recording]
