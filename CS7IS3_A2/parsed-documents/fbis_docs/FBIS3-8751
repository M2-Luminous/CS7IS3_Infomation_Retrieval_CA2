This is what Colonel Miloslav Cech told us yesterday. Recently, he has been appointed new commander of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] Military Police in former Yugoslavia. Colonel Cech will assume his post on 17 March in Zagreb. He will replace a French officer in this position and will stay in it for one year. "The Czech Army has received high recognition since their officers have been appointed to the UNPROFOR command. Experts from European armies have had the opportunity during various meetings to learn about the qualities and capabilities of our professional soldiers, who were given priority over their colleagues from other countries." This is the way the new commander describes the fact that the number of Czech officers in high positions in the UNPROFOR peacekeeping forces have been increasing recently. Jiri Novotny has become commander of the UNPROFOR Sector South Operational Staff, where the Czech soldiers are active. One of the Czech officers is likely to become the commander of the entire sector as of April, and another the commander of the Military Police in that part of the former Yugoslavia. Apart from Colonel Cech, who will be in charge of soldiers from 20 countries, 22 additional Czech military police members will be active in the former Yugoslavia. The Czech UNPROFOR contingent should reach almost 1,000 troops this month.
