Tatsuro Toyoda, head of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, made the request during a breakfast meeting with senior officials of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), including MITI chief Eijiro Hata, the official told a press conference. The auto industry has strived to reinforce its earnings position through globalization of business operations so as not to be easily affected by exchange rate swings, Toyoda was quoted as saying. "But an excessively strong yen would put a drag on such efforts," he said. Hata shared the auto industry's concern over the latest yen rise, saying the yen has appreciated against the dollar to a worrisome level, the official said. The dollar slipped below 100 yen in overnight New York trading for the first time, sinking briefly to a record global low of 99.85 yen. "An excessive strength of the yen could dampen burgeoning recovery in auto sales," said Toyoda, who is also president of Toyota Motor Corp. He said he hoped the government will take action to drive down the yen to "adequate levels." On the trade front, the auto industry renewed its request to the government to hold firm to a policy of rejecting any U.S. proposals that would lead to introduction of "numerical targets," the MITI official said. Yoshifumi Tsuji, president of Nissan Motor Co., was quoted as saying, "The United States has pledged not to seek numerical targets but the auto industry is concerned the issue will be revived during ongoing auto trade talks between the two countries." Hata replied that Japan will seek to settle the trade talks with the U.S. in a manner that will not draw criticism from the global community, the MITI official said. "Japan will say what it should say in line with the spirit of a new global trade order to be formed under the World Trade Organization," Hata was quoted as saying.
