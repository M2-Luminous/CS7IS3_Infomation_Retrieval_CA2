According to military sources, on 6 May, the U.S. imperialists dragged squadrons of fighter planes from its overseas bases into the skies above South Korea and conducted again a provocative aerial war exercise for a Northward invasion. That day, the squadrons of fighter bombers and pursuit-assault planes that moved out from U.S. bases in the Pacific area to the skies above Yongwol, Pyongchang, Taejon, and Yechon frantically waged a surprise attack exercise against strategic targets in the Northern half of the Republic. Mobilized to this war exercise were those airplane squadrons from overseas bases and some 180 various fighter bombers, assault planes, observation planes, and reconnaissance planes of the U.S. occupation Air Force in South Korea and of the puppet Air Force. This frantic war exercise under the command of E-3 airborne warning and control planes that flew from a base in Okinawa, Japan was aimed at examining the practicality [hyonsilsong] of cooperation among airplane squadrons from overseas bases, the U.S. occupation Air Force in South Korea, and the puppet Air Force; and examining their capability of making a surprise attack for a Northward invasion. On the same day, An RC-135 tactical reconnaissance plane flew from an overseas base into the skies above the area near the DMZ and then carried out electronic reconnaissance on strategic points in the northern half of the Republic while flying at a high altitude for a long time. At the same time, A P-3 off-the-shelf aircraft [panjamgi] belonging to the Seventh U.S. Fleet flew into the skies above the East Sea of South Korea and then ran wild in carrying out espionage on our side's coastline and sea. A U-2 high-altitude strategic reconnaissance plane madly photographed and carried out electronic reconnaissance on areas in the Northern half of the Republic while flying day and night in the skies above an area near the Military Demarcation Line [MDL]. In the meantime, the South Korean puppets were frenzied in firing bombs near the MDL in the Demilitarized Zone [DMZ], as well as increasing armed troops there. On 6 May, the South Korean puppets mobilized and deployed several tens of large-caliber gun units in Kumsan-ri, Puju county, with their barrels turned toward Songdong- ri, a western area of the front line in front of us, and moved hundreds of rascals with heavy arms [chungmujang aktangdul] forward from Hyon-ri, Imje county, an eastern area of the front line, and deployed them in an area adjacent to the DMZ. On the same day, after occupying firing positions at Chongja-ri in Paju county and Kangnae-ri in Yonchon county, the puppet Army's large-caliber artillery units showed off a war frenzy by firing tens of bombs at an area near the DMZ. These war maneuvers are a grave challenge to detent and peace on the Korean peninsula.
