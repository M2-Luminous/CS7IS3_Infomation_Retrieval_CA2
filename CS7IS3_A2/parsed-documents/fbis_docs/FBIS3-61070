Fesenko, doctor of technical sciences, and Major S. Zhuravlev, under rubric "Foreign Military Affairs": "Artillery in the Persian Gulf"] [Text] The Persian Gulf war has become the property of history, but interest in features of combat operations in the "Kuwait Desert" is not abating inasmuch as outlines of the "war of new technologies," which will determine the development of military affairs over the next decades to a significant extent, showed up clearly here. Despite repeated statements abroad about artillery's reduced role in modern war, in the "Kuwait Desert" both sides concentrated such an amount that it conceded nothing to the overall strength level of groupings in a number of the largest World War II operations such as the Balaton Operation of 3rd Ukrainian Front. Even by Pentagon estimates, there was a small quantitative superiority on the side of the international forces directly in the combat operations zone. Technical outfitting was another matter. The difference in it, like the difference in conditions for performing combat missions, turned out to be much more significant. U.S. 155-mm M109A2 and 203.2-mm CF M110A2 self-propelled [SP] howitzers, M198 and TR 155-mm towed howitzers, and also MLRS multiple-launch rocket systems made up the basis of multinational forces [MNF] artillery. The majority of artillery systems were self-propelled and over 80 percent were armored. U.S. formations also had several models of the ATACMS tactical missile system (based on the MLRS) equipped with a missile with cluster warhead (100 submunitions with hollow charge-fragmentation effect) with a launch range up to 200 km. Artillery subunits and a considerable number of MNF formations had automated artillery fire control systems and digital data transmission equipment. AN/USQ-70 survey instruments, the PLRS position finding, identification and data transmission system, and a NAVSTAR space navigation system ground receiver were used for topogeodetic support to combat operations. OH-58 reconnaissance helicopters and Pioneer drones were employed to collect data on the enemy and terrain along with radar and sound-ranging reconnaissance equipment as well as artillery forward observers' opto-electronic equipment. In addition, MNF formations were outfitted with mobile stations for receiving data from the J-STARS radar system for aerial reconnaissance of ground targets and control of strikes, which gave a good account of itself when tracking the movement of reserves and the maneuver of enemy artillery at ranges exceeding capabilities of formation reconnaissance equipment. In necessary instances artillery could obtain aerial and space reconnaissance data in planning fires. With respect to Iraq, it had only a limited number of SP armored guns (French-made GCT and Austrian-made GHN-45 155-mm howitzers, 2C3 152-mm howitzers and 2C1 122-mm howitzers). True, this shortcoming was made up to a certain extent by the considerable number of highly mobile MLRS--the BM-21 system and the Brazilian Astros system. Mounted on the base of a vehicle with good cross-country capability, Astros was equipped with transport-launch containers loaded with projectiles of three calibers--127, 180 and 300 mm--with a maximum range of fire of 30, 35 and 60 km respectively. It is noteworthy that the system surpassed the U.S. MLRS in a number of its characteristics. A large number of Iraqi artillery pieces were towed. Approximately half consisted of M-46 130-mm guns, but South African 155-mm guns were also present (G-5 howitzers, which western military specialists placed among the best models of towed systems in the world). The predominance of artillery pieces superior to the majority of similar MNF systems in range of fire (Table 1) permitted the Iraqis to locate firing positions at a considerable distance (10-20 km) from the sides' line of contact while retaining the capability to effectively pressure enemy artillery deployed near the Kuwait border. Table 1 - Comparative Range Assessment of MNF and Iraqi Artillery Systems At the same time, the great diversity of systems of calibers in Iraqi artillery substantially complicated its combat employment and logistic support. There also was a most negative effect from the outfitting of Iraqi artillery with obsolete communications equipment, the personnel's total inability to use it under communications jamming conditions, and the poor state of supply of automated command and control equipment, especially at echelons above the artillery battalion. Finally, the shortage of radar equipment and absence of aerial and space reconnaissance assets cannot be discounted. In the opinion of western military specialists, Iraqi artillerymen "proved incapable of looking behind the nearest sandhills." The conclusion from what has been said is quite obvious: as a whole, Iraqi artillery was seriously inferior to MNF artillery in its technical level. Meanwhile, the Iraqi command's defensive concept gave artillery a deciding role in destroying tanks and motorized infantry. The concept of the defense envisaged drawing attackers onto minefields of the "Saddam Hussein line," with their subsequent destruction by massed, concentrated artillery fire from indirect firing positions. Thus, a serious miscalculation was contained in the very sense of the defense; blindly following the chosen operating tactics and passively waiting for an attack by enemy ground troops could not, of course, bring success. Let us briefly examine the conditions for mission accomplishment by the sides' artillery. In deploying at firing positions without engineer preparation within range of Iraqi artillery, MNF artillerymen correctly feared its return fire. Therefore at first they changed positions immediately after executing fire missions, but after seeing that as a rule there was no return fire, they subsequently gave up the fire-evasion maneuver. Division counterbattery fire systems deployed near the state border with Kuwait and operated in a "waiting" mode. The fire of individual batteries against command and control facilities and other important targets on the "Saddam Hussein line" was used widely to uncover the makeup of Iraqi artillery groupings. In case of return fire, the counterbattery fire systems would open up fire for effect. In raiding operations one artillery battalion most often was attached to battalion task forces for direct fire support and one or two radars and an MLRS platoon were attached for counterbattery activities. Their radios were in the same radio net and, on deploying into combat formation, supported the transmission of data on detected targets directly to the latter's fire control station. This permitted significantly reducing time for preparing return fire. An MLRS platoon or howitzer artillery battalion usually is used to engage one battery. The MLRS conducted fire for effect with cluster projectiles with submunitions having hollow charge-fragmentation effect, and artillery pieces fired HE-fragmentation projectiles with impact or time fuze. It must be said that the MNF command regarded Iraqi artillery as a serious threat to operations of its ground troops. It also saw it as the primary means of employing chemical weapons if the Iraqi leadership decided to use them, for Iraqi artillerymen were well trained and it was of no small importance that they had combat experience of eight years of war with Iran. Therefore artillery at positions was included among very important targets. It was engaged by fighter-bombers, A-6 and A-10 attack aircraft, AH-64 Apache combat helicopters and, in the second stage of Operation Desert Storm, by division counterbattery fire systems and ship guns, including 406-mm main battery guns of the battleships Wisconsin and Missouri. Aviation employed precision and conventional bombs and combat helicopters employed the Hellfire ATGM. Attempts to use fuel-air explosive munitions, which had given a good account of themselves in engaging large targets, proved insufficiently effective in combating small targets. During Operation Desert Storm MNF artillery supported the deployment of friendly ground troop formations in operational tasking areas and their redeployment in accordance with the concept of subsequent offensive operations, delivered fires on the "Saddam Hussein line," conducted counterbattery fire, demolished engineer works, carried out fire support to raiding operations of battalion task forces, used fire to cover the breaching of obstacles, and took part in repelling assaults by Iraqi troops. As a rule, separate artillery battalions were used to perform those missions. Observed targets were registered by battery and battalion volleys. Depending on the size of targets, batteries conducted fire for effect at several range settings and several deflection settings (from one to three), expending two rounds per gun per setting. Engagement was accomplished by brief fire assaults usually not lasting longer than 10 minutes. As the beginning of Operation Desert Sword approached, the intensity of MNF artillery combat operations increased. Its deployment was completed three days before the beginning of the offensive. The most powerful fire assault was at this time. It was conducted against Iraqi troop positions on 21 February 1991, and over 10 battalions from the UK 1st Armored Division and a number of U.S. units were used for it. In addition to 12 MLRS launchers, 72 artillery pieces took part in the fire assault from the British side. In the assessment of a command representative, the weight of their volley was 50 tonnes, i.e., quadruple that of the 882 guns of the UK 9th Army in the Battle of El Alamein in 1942. Individual ATACMS missile system launchers were used to engage targets in the depth (SAM and artillery positions, command and control facilities, logistic installations and so on). According to press data, a number of important targets were engaged by single missile strikes. Shifting to Iraqi artillery operations, it should be noted that they were complicated also by the special desert conditions, where each position and each vehicle was clearly observed from the air with the contrast of daylight illumination. The movement of military columns was visible at great distances due to long dust plumes, which hampered the daytime maneuver of artillery under conditions of absolute superiority of MNF aviation. And at night it became easy prey to aircraft employing bombs with thermal-imaging and infrared homing heads. Despite the significant extent of maskirovka [lit. "camouflage," however, includes "concealment" and "deception"] measures performed by Iraqi artillerymen, they did not always achieve the goal inasmuch as firing positions were easily detected from the air from the characteristic disposition of guns in a line. One firing position was the absolute copy of another, which facilitated their detection by aerial reconnaissance. As the epicenter of Operation Desert Storm shifted to troop groupings disposed at the southern border of Kuwait, strikes against Iraqi artillery became more and more fierce, as attested by data of Table 2. While 55 Iraqi guns were knocked out during the first two weeks of the operation, 385 were knocked out right away during the last week. In other words, the intensity of Iraqi artillery losses had increased almost 14 times by the end of Operation Desert Storm. Table 2 - Dynamics of Iraqi Artillery Losses by Days of Operation Desert Storm Days of Operation 14th 30th 38th Amount of losses Artillery pieces 55 1100 1485 As a percentage 2 35 48 It is also evident from the table that by the beginning of the ground troop offensive the MNF succeeded in knocking out around half of Iraqi artillery through the comprehensive effect of all weapons. This permitted bringing the artillery force ratio to 2:1 in favor of the MNF. And the ratio turned out to be even greater considering the fact that in attempting to preserve the latest equipment the Iraqi command decided to withdraw G-5 and GHN-45 155-mm howitzers, the Astros MLRS and a number of other artillery pieces to the rear ahead of time. Significant losses also were inflicted on Iraqi artillery personnel. Survivors ended up considerably demoralized. Employment of artillery in the battle of Ras Khafji (on the night of 28/29 January 1991), when several tank and motorized infantry battalions of the 1st and 5th motorized infantry divisions assaulted subunit positions of the U.S. 1st Marine Division and Saudi troops, was the most indicative with respect to the Iraqis. The assault was supported by the fire of several artillery battalions and salvos of Astros MLRS. This probably was the only case of mass employment of Iraqi artillery. Taking advantage of the effect of surprise and the powerful fire support, the attackers took Ras Khafji but were unable to exploit the success achieved without reliable air cover and soon were forced to withdraw to the initial positions. It also should be noted that Iraqi artillery fire, whose strong psychological effect is beyond doubt, was not very effective since it was conducted not against specific targets, but against presumed disposition areas of MNF subunits. Thus, MNF artillery was able to perform fire missions without fear of enemy artillery return fire. The technical capabilities for realizing the concept of "fire strike/firing position change" ("shoot and scoot") were not called for. Operation Desert Sword began with a powerful fire assault against Iraqi troop positions, reserves, command and control facilities and weapons; and with electronic jamming. The length of fire preparation of the assault in regiments [and] of formation operations varied. It did not exceed 20 minutes in Marine divisions, but it was 45 minutes in the UK 4th Armored Brigade. MNF artillery managed to inflict telling personnel and equipment losses on the enemy during fire preparation of the assault. During the offensive MNF artillery supported the friendly troop assault, supported the landing and operations of helicopter and amphibious assault forces, supported operations of attackers in taking Al Kuwait, took part in repelling counterattacks by Iraqi troops and in consolidating captured lines and objectives, and continued counterbattery activities. In operating as part of an enveloping grouping, organic and attached artillery (from three to seven artillery battalions) of formations moved at the head of main body columns in readiness for immediate deployment. An assault on Republican Guard positions near Basra was preceded by a 30-minute fire preparation, which facilitated MNF formations' capture of crossings over the Euphrates River. When individual Iraqi batteries and battalions attempted to prevent the attackers' advance, they immediately came under bombardment. Thus, one MLRS subunit and two 203.2-mm howitzer battalions destroyed 97 out of 100 artillery pieces of one Iraqi division with their fire, i.e., the fire of artillery and especially of MLRS proved more effective than air strikes. Persian Gulf war experience confirmed that under present conditions the role of aerial reconnaissance operating in support of the delivery of fires is growing considerably. The possibility of using the J-STARS system for planning MNF field artillery fire substantially increased the latter's capabilities of engaging highly mobile, unobserved targets, and this contributed to no small extent to its success in opposing Iraqi artillery. Division counterbattery fire systems demonstrated high combat capabilities dictated by the deep integration of reconnaissance assets, command and control assets and weapons. Centralized use of radars of the Firefinder radar system, which permitted creating a radar field with overlapping of two to four times in areas of enemy artillery firing positions and maintaining it for the entire battle and which provided reliable detection of enemy firing batteries, proved justified. Automated processing and transmission of data to weapon fire control stations using the TACFIRE automated command and control system (which has a high degree of automation of fire preparation processes and short volley duration) permitted substantially reducing systems' reaction time to the detection of targets. Iraqi artillery could win the fight with counterbattery fire systems only with adequate technical outfitting, which it did not have. That which fully justified itself in the Iran-Iraq military conflict proved unsuitable in the "war of new technologies." Slow-moving subunits of towed pieces became easy prey for modern automated systems, which managed to open fire for effect before the shells of detected enemy batteries burst. The effectiveness of counterbattery fire systems was determined to a considerable extent by good performance characteristics of the MLRS. Along with a high degree of automation, its important feature was canister loading. The use of transport-launch canisters noticeably accelerated the loading of launchers and permitted considerably increasing their readiness for performing fire missions in the course of battle. According to prisoners' statements, surprise MLRS salvos were a very effective means of engaging Iraqi towed artillery. This was determined both by the high destructive capacity of hollow charge-fragmentation submunitions and by the stunning effect of salvo fire on the personnel's minds. With the missile warhead filled with 644 (according to other data 688) submunitions, the salvo of one combat vehicle numbered around 8,000 submunitions dispersing in a 400x400 m area. According to assessments of foreign military specialists, achieving a similar effect required using 22 M109 155-mm howitzers for firing with an expenditure of four rounds per piece. It was no accident that MLRS salvos were nicknamed "steel rain" by the Iraqis. Over 10,000 missiles with cluster warheads and 30 ATACMS missiles were expended during combat operations. Along with this, it is impossible not to recognize that the Iraqi artillery command underestimated the importance of counterbattery fire in our time, had nothing with which to counter U.S. tactics of conducting it, and did not promptly make necessary changes in methods by which artillery performed fire missions. It also must be recognized that successful operations of artillery are impossible today without reliable air cover. Persian Gulf war experience shows that its absence is fraught with serious human and material losses. Outfitting troops with NAVSTAR space navigation system ground equipment considerably simplified topogeodetic support to their combat operations on terrain that was poor in contour points (reference points). Its wide use accelerated the determination of firing position coordinates during deployment in unsurveyed areas. It played a role of no less importance in the course of the multikilometer desert march by MNF troops in executing an enveloping maneuver. At the same time, the experience of employing the above equipment in artillery combat operations showed that its potential capabilities can be realized to the full extent if each battery and the battalion staff are outfitted with two sets of navigation system receivers at the very least. This will enable determining not only rectangular coordinates and the absolute height of artillery combat formation elements, but also grid azimuths of directions of orientation, which will ensure high autonomy of each artillery subunit, including when realizing the "shoot and scoot" concept. The M190A2 SP and M198 towed 155-mm howitzers earned a differing evaluation. The former showed high mobility in the course of marches of many hours over rugged and often difficult terrain. Like other equipment on a wheeled base, the latter demanded special attention. In addition to tire pressure adjustment, ensuring its successful movement in the desert required advance distribution of repair, overhaul and rebuilding assets along movement routes, especially in places where it was possible to expect a delay in column movement. Nevertheless, U.S. military specialists admit that both the M190A2 and M110A2 SP howitzers are considerably obsolete. The former in particular was substantially inferior to the French GCT 155-mm howitzer. This piece, mounted on the AMK-30 tank chassis and with a barrel 40 calibers long, is capable of firing rocket-assisted projectiles to ranges up to 30 km. It also considerably surpasses the U.S. howitzer in rate of fire (thanks to an automatic loader) and in the number of rounds in battle stowage. In the process of the howitzer's projected modernization, it is planned to install the M2284 long-barrel gun, which will permit increasing the maximum range of fire from 23.5 km to 30 km. It is also proposed to outfit the gun with a more advanced fire control system, a more advanced night sight, new communications equipment and a system for protection against mass destruction weapons. It is characteristic that as a result of the brevity of fire preparation of the assault on axes of operations of some MNF formations, Operation Desert Sword essentially began immediately with fire support. This evidently is explained by the fact that it was preceded by the lengthy period of the "electronic-fire" phase of the war, during which considerable damage was done to the enemy, command and control was disorganized, and his will to resist was undermined. In the course of fire support, the system of its coordination adopted in the U.S. Army gave a positive account of itself on the whole. Fire support coordination elements at all command and control echelons down to and including the infantry (tank) company, artillery forward observers in platoons, and high personnel training ensured close coordination of field artillery with combined arms units and subunits in the course of the offensive and timely requests for fire against newly detected targets; and the presence of forward air controllers and shore parties for spotting ship gunfire in the fire support coordination teams of motorized infantry (tank) companies ensured precise coordination of the fire of field artillery and ship guns with air strikes. In the course of combat operations, however, the insufficient technical outfitting of artillery forward observers and imperfection of the accepted scheme for passing their fire support requests were revealed. The increased range of effective fire of combined arms subunit weapons, above all tanks and ATGM systems, considerably increased their capabilities to destroy observed targets, i.e., targets which previously were engaged based on requests of artillery forward observers. The forward observers themselves, moving in combat formations of motorized infantry platoons, were not always able to be disposed in places where a special threat to combined arms subunits was possible. At the same time the number and importance of weapons taking part in close combat but unobserved from ground observation posts (mortars, FOG ATGM systems and so on) sharply increased. Consequently, in the course of combat operations a contradiction was revealed between the increased number of targets determining the course and outcome of close combat and the capabilities of artillery forward observers to detect them. In the opinion of foreign military specialists, its solution should be sought on the one hand along paths of improving the outfitting of artillery forward observers, particularly the creation of devices with variable observation height and disposed on telescopic masts (or underground platforms), and on the other hand in a change in the procedure for passing fire support requests from artillery forward observers. In a number of cases in the course of Operation Desert Sword the requests did not go directly to weapon fire control stations or to company fire support coordination teams as required by U.S. Field Manual FM 6-20, but to fire support coordination officers in battalions. This enabled determining the priority of requests based on interests not of the platoon (company), but of the battalion as a whole, and using the entire arsenal of weapons at its commander's disposal for fulfilling them. The latter evidently is the main thing inasmuch as it reflects a general trend manifested during the Persian Gulf war--using the maximum number of weapons for performing fire delivery missions that arise suddenly. This permits not only performing unscheduled missions in the shortest time and thereby freeing up weapons faster for performing other fire missions, but also making maximum use of the psychological effect of concentrated fire on personnel. It also is impossible to ignore the conclusion drawn by western specialists based on a generalization of artillery combat employment in the Persian Gulf. Despite the fact that formation commanders had a considerable amount of general support assets, which if necessary were capable of having a decisive effect on the course of combat operations, commanders of subunits participating in the battle must have a sufficient amount of artillery for direct fire support. Only this gives them necessary tactical mobility and independence in performing combat missions. Consequently, the serious results achieved by MNF aviation during Operation Desert Storm did not shake the joint command's views on the role and importance of artillery in performing missions of direct fire support to troop combat operations. Meanwhile, as shown by experience of MNF artillery combat operations, there was nothing new that appeared in their organization and conduct which would have differed substantially from known provisions of field manuals of countries which participated in the Persian Gulf war. Moreover, in the course of combat operations numerous deviations were allowed from demands of field manuals: firing subunits conducted fire from one and the same firing positions for a long time, artillery pieces at positions were disposed in the open and not camouflaged, field artillery radars as a rule operated in a continuous mode and so on. With an adequate enemy reaction, such violations could have led to serious personnel and equipment losses. COPYRIGHT: VOYENNYY VESTNIK No 8 1993
