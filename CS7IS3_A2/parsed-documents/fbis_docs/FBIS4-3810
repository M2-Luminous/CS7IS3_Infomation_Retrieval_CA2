The death occurred after a fire broke out during testing of the new "Fengyun 2" satellite April 2 at China's Xichang launch centre in the western province of Sichuan, a China Aerospace Corp. spokesman said. "One technician was killed and around 12 were injured," he added. Previous reports of the incident had merely mentioned an "accidental event," without detailing the extent of damage or number of casualties. The satellite and the workshop in which it was housed were both badly damaged in the fire, the spokesman said. The satellite had been scheduled for launching in June aboard a Long March-3 rocket. A new launch date has yet to be fixed. China has launched three metereological satellites since 1988 but the Fengyun-2 is to be the first "geo-stationary" model, orbitting 36,000 kilometers (22,500 miles) from the earth and monitoring one third of its surface. China is extremely sensitive about its satellite launch programme which has suffered several setbacks since its inception in 1970, including an aborted attempt to send the Australian Optus-B2 satellite into orbit in December 1992 aboard a Long March 2E rocket. China pinned the blame for that failure on the US-made satellite, but some foreign experts have called into question the construction and relatively simple technology of the Chinese rockets. In October last year, China and the United States got involved in a row over a Chinese satellite that had got lost in orbit and which the Americans claimed had plunged into the Pacific. China, while admitting the satellite was lost, repeatedly denied that it had fallen to earth. A total of five Chinese satellites have been scheduled for launch this year.
