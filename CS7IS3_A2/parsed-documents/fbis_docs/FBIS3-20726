Rabrenovic: "24 Firms Closed Down in Kosovksa Mitrovica"] [Excerpt] The republic market inspectorate closed down 24 private stores in Kosovska Mitrovica [Kosovo] for violating the regulations of the new economic program. According to Stojan Zdravkovic, chief republic market inspector, the official exchange rate prescribed by the National Bank of Yugoslavia was not respected. "The new dinar was worth much less there than the German mark, so the products were mostly purchased with foreign currency because the prices set in new dinars were much less favorable. Because of this great difference and the disregard of the established parity, we were forced to close down these stores," Zdravkovic explained. The disrespect of the measures of the new economic program, according to Zdravkovic, has been most pronounced in Kosovo and Metohija thus far. In the remaining parts of the republic, private and especially state enterprises have been accepting the new conditions of business operations and adapting to the measures dictated by the anti-inflation program. The market inspectorate in Belgrade has also been operating at full speed. "Irregularities and disrespect of regulations have always existed, and naturally they exist now too. However, almost everyone has been respecting the prices prescribed and the new exchange rate. Firms were closed down in recent days, but mostly because the merchants did not have the proper accompanying documents for certain goods," Miodrag Nikolic, chief city market inspector said.
