Should the FDP fail also in the Euroelections after the setbacks in Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein this would mean the political ouster for the previous member of the Bundestag, who distinguished herself in Bonn particularly in the conflict over Section 218. In the Euroelections in 1989 the FDP barely survived with 5.4 percent. [Sattler] In Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein the FDP slipped below 5 percent. In 1989 the German liberals reached only 5.4 percent in the European elections. Is the ouster imminent in the polls on 12 June as well? [Wuerfel] We still have to make a great effort within the next few weeks until 12 June. We have to make clear to the citizens which policy the liberals plan to realize in the European Parliament. We have to illustrate the potential political loss if there were no longer any FDP delegates in the liberal caucus in Strasbourg. [Sattler] Many citizens consider Euroelections as internal protest and teaching-them-a-lesson elections. Do you even have a chance in the election campaign to emphasize European policies? [Wuerfel] Since January I have appeared at 70 events nationwide and I have found that interest is growing in European concerns. The European Parliament has far more jurisdiction than many citizens are aware of. For example, during my activity as Bonn delegate I came to realize: Every second sociopolitical law in Germany is based on an EU [European Union] guideline, and German parliamentarians were not involved in the latter's preparation. [Sattler] Internally, the FDP is frequently elected in a certain coalition context--as a procurer of majorities or as a majority correction. However, in the Europarliament no government is elected. How does the FDP plan to justify its necessity beyond its small group of regular voters? [Wuerfel] The rights of codetermination of the Strasbourg parliament, expanded after Maastricht, have absolutely concrete meaning to the citizens; the issues are the consequences of the domestic market, health protection, consumer protection, women's interests. In my view it is essential that liberal ideas have an effect on these issues via the European Parliament. We need energetic politicians who will prevent, for example, that the EU medicine act erects obstacles in Germany for natural remedies. [Sattler] Where, in fact, lies the focus of the FDP Euroelection campaign in substance? [Wuerfel] One thing is clear to us liberals: In view of the global competition Germany, the economic site, can only be secured at the European level. I consider issues of economic policy a priority in the election campaign. European policy must also be used to promote deregulation, debureaucratization, and privatization. Particularly as a sociopolitician I know: Whatever is distributed sociopolitically must first be worked for by a strong economy. Therefore our Europolicy serves to secure the site of Germany. [Sattler] Foreign Minister Kinkel's role has been criticized in connection with German-French dissonances. Does this also damage Kinkel's role in the FDP Euroelection campaign? [Wuerfel] I view as a great achievement Kinkel's negotiation skill and tenacity during the EU expansion negotiations with Austria, Norway, Sweden, and Finland. Kinkel could not tolerate that the remarks of the French Ambassador Scheer damage the position of the Spanish foreign minister as well. Therefore Kinkel acted so forcefully, which is now being criticized by some. Parisian Foreign Minister Juppe and President Mitterrand have apologized for the behavior of their ambassador. The irritations between Bonn and Paris have been cleared. Even among friends it must be possible to call a spade a spade--without affecting the friendship. [Sattler] On which target group is the FDP focusing in the Euroelection campaign? [Wuerfel] In view of a growing mania for regulation I am committed to promote the freedom of decision for people. The bureaucratic constraint in many social spheres inhibits many achievement-oriented women and men; it must be stopped. I am addressing the achievement-elite starting with the skilled worker and on up, the people who want to act with direct responsibility and for whom solidarity comes before self-interest. [Sattler] If the FDP should fail on 12 June: What happens to Uta Wuerfel? Then you won't come to Strasbourg, and you will not be represented in the Bundestag any longer. [Wuerfel] I can only appeal to the citizens to enable me, through their vote, to support their interests in the European Parliament. For me it was a question of personal credibility to enter this election without tricks and dodges. My motive for the candidacy to the Strasbourg parliament was the realization that in the course of the European unification many decisions will be made bypassing the parliamentarians in Bonn. If the FDP should fail on 12 June I will no longer be able to make policy for the citizens.
