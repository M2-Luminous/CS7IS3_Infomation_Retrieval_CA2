FR940802-2-00092 FR940802-2-00054 Determination of Eligibility Upon Filing of a Claim New Subsection 15(b) provides that when a claim is filed pursuant to Section 13 or 25 of the Code (i.e., when the Statement of Claim, Uniform Submission Agreement, each properly executed, and required fees have been received by the Arbitration Department and the Statement of Claim is ready to be served), the Director of Abritration will examine each claim for relief to determine if it alleges less than six (6) years have elapsed between the occurrence or event giving rise to the dispute, claim or controversy and filing of the claim. For example, if a claim seeks recovery of the purchase price of an investment on the basis of misstatements or lack of suitability at the time of purchase, and the purchase occurred nine (9) years before the claim was filed, it will be ineligible for arbitration. If, however, the same claim seeks recovery for loss of the value of the investment on the basis of misstatements or omissions which caused the claimant to refrain from selling the investment, and the misstatements or omissions occurred five (5) years ago, the claim will be eligible for arbitration. 2 2 See infra discussion concerning bifurcation of claims. The proposed rule change will not permit an otherwise ineligible claim to become eligible through the allegation of fraudulent concealment and equitable tolling. In the example cited above, for instance, if the claimant alleged that the respondent made a series of misstatements dating back nine (9) years to the original transaction, the claim would be eligible for arbitration only to the extent that recovery was sought or could be had for misstatements made within six (6) years of filing. While the NASD would not necessarily ask the claimant to clarify the claim, the eligibility determination, which would be part of the record upon submission to the arbitrators, would advise the parties and the arbitrators of the limitation on the claims submitted for arbitration. In each example, the Director of Arbitration will not be making eligibility determinations on the basis of subjective evaluations of whether the eligibility of the claim is proven, but, rather, solely on an objective determination of whether the claim has stated that the occurrence or event giving rise to the claim took place within six (6) years. 3 3 The NASD notes, and assumes that claimants and respondents are aware, that bad faith allegations of fraud, or other facts, designed to establish or defeat the eligibility of a claim, would be counterproductive. If the eligibility of a claim were established or, for those claims in which a portion of the initial claims were determined to be ineligible, defeated as a result of such bad faith allegations and the nature of the allegations was discovered by the arbitrators prior to the award, such conduct may affect the arbitrators' determination of credibility issues in the case, or of the nature and amount of the remedies and relief awarded. The NASD notes further that any such bad faith allegations by a member or associated person may result in a referral of the matter for disciplinary investigation and action as conduct inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade in violation of Article III, Section 1 of the Rules of Fair Practice. In addition, proposed Subsection 15(b) provides that if the Statement of Claim fails to clearly state that less than six (6) years have elapsed between the occurrence or event giving rise to the dispute, claim or controversy and filing, the Director may ask the claimant to modify the Statement of Claim to do so. 4 The time limit for a response will be set in communications with the claimant. If the claimant fails or refuses to respond, the Director of Arbitration will determine the eligibility of the claim for submission to arbitration on the basis of the Statement of Claim then on file. Thus, while the Director will give the claimant a chance to correct any deficiencies to permit the claimant to establish the eligibility of the claim, the opportunity will not be open-ended. 4 See supra n. 2. Determination of Disputed Eligibility Proposed new Subsection 15(c) provides that a responding party, after service of the Statement of Claim, but prior to the date the parties are notified of the appointment of the arbitrators for the hearing or the appointment of an arbitrator to consider prehearing issues, may file a notice of objection to dispute the determination of the Director of Arbitration that the Statement of Claim alleges that less than six (6) years have elapsed between the event or occurrence giving rise to the dispute, claim or controversy giving rise to the claim and filing. The notice must be supported by statements of fact and documentary evidence and may only be submitted along with or after the responding party submits an executed Uniform Submission Agreement and pays any fees or deposits required under the Code. 5 5 By conditioning the submission of a notice of objection on the submission of a Uniform Submission Agreement and appropriate fees, the NASD avoids expending resources making eligibility determinations for parties that have not complied with the requirements of the Code or paid for the use of the forum. The NASD does not believe that a party disputing the eligibility of a claim should be able to have its objection considered if it has no intention of participating in the arbitration of the claim without engaging in collateral litigation. By insisting on the submission of an executed Uniform Submission Agreement, the NASD and the other parties to the matter should be able to defend against any such collateral litigation by asserting that the objecting party agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Code, one of which (Section 15) grants the Director the exclusive authority to determine the eligibility of a claim. Following submission of the notice of objection, the Director of Arbitration must notify the other parties that one of the responding parties has disputed the eligibility of the claim. 6 The Director will then permit the claimant and any other party to respond to the allegations of the responding party with respect to eligibility within such time period as the Director of Arbitration establishes in communications with the parties. 6 The Director's notification to the parties of the eligibility dispute and the time limitation for a response does not relieve the parties of the obligation under other provisions of the Code to serve the other parties with copies of pleadings and submissions.
