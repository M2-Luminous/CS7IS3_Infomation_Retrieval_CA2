FR940527-1-00131 FR940527-1-00014 The chart shows that the cumulative effect of the revised rates of increase is to lower the FY 1994 budget neutrality target by 13.56 percent. Together with the 0.54 percent decline due to updated HCRIS data, this accounts for the 14.01 percent reduction in the FY 1995 capital cost per case budget neutrality target compared to the level estimated at the time of the FY 1994 final rule. For FY 1994, we employed a budget neutrality factor of 0.8947 to realize the 90 percent target. In this proposed rule for FY 1995, the budget neutrality adjustment factor is 0.7986. The budget neutrality factors are not built permanently into the rates; that is, the factors are not applied cumulatively in determining the Federal rate. The net adjustment to the FY 1994 Federal rate would therefore be .7986/.8947 or 0.8926. For the final rule, we will recalculate the budget neutrality factor on the basis of the most recent data available. 5. Exceptions Payment Adjustment Factor Section 412.308(c)(3) requires that the standard Federal rate for inpatient capital-related costs be reduced by an adjustment factor equal to the estimated additional payments for exceptions under §412.348 determined as a proportion of total payments under the hospital-specific rate and Federal rate. The model developed for determining the budget neutrality adjustment factor is also used to estimate payments under the exceptions payment process and to determine the exceptions payment adjustment factor. For FY 1994, we estimated that exceptions payments would equal 5.15 percent of aggregate payments based on the Federal rate and the hospital-specific rate. Therefore, we applied an exceptions reduction factor of 0.9485 (1^.0515) in determining the Federal rate. For FY 1995, we estimate that exceptions payments will equal 2.03 percent of aggregate payments based on the Federal rate and the hospital-specific rate. Therefore, we propose to apply an exceptions reduction factor of 0.9797 (1^.0203) to determine the FY 1995 Federal rate. The exceptions reductions factors are not built permanently into the rates; that is, the factors are not applied cumulatively in determining the Federal rate. The net adjustment to the FY 1995 Federal rate is therefore .9797/.9485, or 1.0329. The proposed exceptions reduction factor for FY 1995 is thus 3.29 percent higher than the factor for FY 1994. 6. Standard Federal Rate for FY 1995 For FY 1994, the Federal rate was $378.34. With the changes we are proposing to the factors used to establish the Federal rate, the FY 1995 Federal rate would be $353.87. The proposed changes are as follows: •The FY 1995 update factor would be 1.0222. •The FY 1995 outlier adjustment factor would be 0.9372. •The FY 1995 budget neutrality adjustment factor that is applied to the standard Federal payment rate for changes in the DRG relative weights and in the geographic adjustment factor would be 1.00115. •The FY 1995 budget neutrality adjustment factor that is applied to the standard Federal payment rate and the hospital-specific rate to assure that aggregate payments equal 90 percent of payments that would have been made on a reasonable cost basis would be 0.7986. •The FY 1995 exceptions payments adjustment factor would be 0.9797. Since the Federal rate has already been adjusted for differences in case mix, wages, cost of living, indirect medical education costs, and payments to hospitals serving a disproportionate share of low-income patients, we propose to make no additional adjustments in the standard Federal rate for these factors other than the budget neutrality factors for changes in the DRG relative weights and the geographic adjustment factor. We are providing a chart that shows how each of the factors and adjustments for FY 1995 affected the computation of the proposed FY 1995 Federal rate in comparison to the FY 1994 Federal rate. The FY 1995 update factor has the effect of increasing the Federal rate 2.22 percent compared to the rate in FY 1994, while the geographic and DRG budget neutrality factor has the effect of increasing the Federal rate by 0.12 percent. The FY 1995 exceptions reduction factor has the effect of increasing the Federal rate by 3.29 percent compared to the exceptions reduction for FY 1994. The proposed FY 1995 budget neutrality adjustment factor has the effect of reducing the final FY 1994 rate by 10.74 percent compared to the budget neutrality reduction in FY 1994. The combined effect of all the proposed changes is to decrease the proposed Federal rate by 6.47 percent compared to the Federal rate for FY 1994.
