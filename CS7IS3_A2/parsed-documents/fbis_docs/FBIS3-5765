"The Korean people distrust all foreigners." "The Korean Government does not want foreign corporations that have invested capital in Korea to succeed in business." These are the American complaints often heard these days. In the latter half of the 1980's, when surpluses in Korean trade with the United States grew, the United States strongly pressured Korea to open its markets. There is a critical difference in the American mood between now and then. In the 1980's, the United States had called on us to open the market under the premise that the two countries would continue to maintain a close alliance. Now what it says is different. It now makes a brave show of nerves, saying that if Korea should ever reject American businesses, they would depart Korea, for there are many other countries welcoming them, for instance, China, Vietnam, and so forth. They say that if Korea does not want to maintain close U.S. relations, they would be compelled to regard the Korean-U.S. alliance ties maintained to date just as "a chance occurrence in history, and that there is not necessarily any reason for maintaining the alliance ties any longer." Why have things turned out like this? The most important reason, in my view, is that communism has fallen and the Soviet Union has collapsed. Up to now, Korean-U.S. alliance ties have been based on the common perception of threat -- they were both facing a "communist threat." Of course, the Korean-U.S. security relationship is still maintained as it is because of the threat from North Korea. From a long-range viewpoint, the fall of world communism has rendered anticommunism meaningless, and Korean-U.S. relations without anticommunism have made new "adhesives" necessary. Unlike in the past, the United States, in particular, is now in the position that it has to regard economic interests more seriously than military considerations. For this reason, it is looking for a new bonding agent in its economic relations. How should we cope with this situation? First of all, we should consider where the most important interests lie. Russia is roaming amid confusion; China is growing at a horrible speed, and Japan is now standing on the crossroads of maintaining the existing situation or reform. At this point, the United States is the only superpower in the world and is located outside the Northeast Asian region. In what shape should we build our relations with the United States to make them most conducive to the political independence and survival of our nation in the future? On this question, we should form a forthright, clear-cut, national consensus. Otherwise, our foreign policy will become adrift without any distinct direction and economic and national security policies will be in danger of conflicting with each other. To state the conclusion first, it is essential for Korea to maintain relations with the United States, the superpower outside the region, although it might be important to keep relations with Northeast Asian countries. The Republic of Korea needs a geopolitically steady balance of power in Northeast Asia. Without U.S. participation, a stable balance is impossible in today's circumstances. There is no denying that Korea needs the United States. Second, we must seriously think about the economy. Our self-reliance does not dictate that we should reject, based on emotionalism, whatever is called for by a great power. That is not our national identity either. When foreign businesses create employment opportunities here, is that indeed a minus factor for us? If Korea should close the market only to protect domestic industries, could such a protected industry be competitive with foreign business corporations in the world market? Will it be possible for us to develop high technologies, which require enormous sums of investment capital, ourselves? The economic "space" called China is now increasingly broadening to an extent hardly imaginable. To make inroads into that economic sphere, will it not be to the advantage of our businesses to establish strategic ties with American businesses? If the answers to those questions are that we also need American businesses, we should open the door to the Korean economy on our own, without waiting for the U.S. calls. Before opening the markets, we should resolutely carry out "change and reform," without wasting time, in order to change those things that need changing first. Finally, we should explain our position to foreigners fairly, squarely, and clearly in a straightforward manner. If we decide to open the door, we should also explain if we need to make necessary preparations for market liberalization. Importance is attached to some indirect and implicative expressions in the Oriental culture. In the West, particularly in the American culture, we need to bear in mind that clear-cut and direct expressions are taken seriously. There is no mistake that building new Korean-U.S. relations without anticommunism will be one of our most difficult tasks ahead. I believe, however, that it will be the most worthwhile work. Our relations with the United States based on anticommunism had been inescapable, but were not necessarily desirable. Now both Korea and the United States have finally come to participate jointly in the positive work for prosperity and freedom.
