FR940930-1-00040 FR940930-1-00015 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background RSPA published a final rule under Docket No. PS&hyph;126 (Amendments 190&hyph;5, 192&hyph;72, 193&hyph;9, and 195&hyph;50) requiring operators of gas, hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines to design and construct new pipelines and portions of pipelines on which replacements are made to accommodate the passage of smart pigs (59 FR 17275; April 12, 1994). Among the provisions for gas transmission lines, 49 CFR 192.150(a) requires that: *␣*␣* each new transmission line and each line section of a transmission line where the line pipe, valve, fitting or other line component is replaced must be designed and constructed to accommodate the passage of instrumented internal inspection devices. The term ``line section'' was defined (in §192.3) as a continuous run of transmission line between adjacent compressor stations, between a compressor station and storage facilities, between a compressor station and a block valve, or between adjacent block valves. It was derived from a definition already in use for hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines (§195.2). Several specific exceptions to the requirements in §192.150(a) are provided, including one for offshore gas transmission lines less than 10 inches in nominal diameter that transport gas to onshore facilities. In addition, under §192.150(b)(8) an operator may seek a specific exception to be based upon a RSPA finding that it would be impracticable to design and construct a transmission line for the passage of smart pigs. Requests for Stay and Petitions for Reconsideration The Interstate Natural Gas Association of America (INGAA) filed a ``Request for a Stay of the Effective Date [May 12, 1994] of the Final Rule; Passage of Instrumented Internal Inspection Devices'' dated May 4, 1994. INGAA requests that RSPA stay until at least January 1, 1995, that provision of the final rule requiring a line section, as defined in 49 CFR §192.3, to be modified to accommodate smart pigs whenever a line pipe, valve, fitting, or other line component is replaced in a line section. To support their request for a stay, INGAA notes that the 1994 summer replacement/rehabilitation work is in progress and that funds for modification of line sections have not been allocated by operators. INGAA also argues that there was procedural error in the rulemaking process. INGAA also filed a ``Petition for Reconsideration of the Final Rule; Passage of Instrumented Internal Inspection Devices'' dated May 10, 1994. INGAA asks that the definition of ``line section'' be deleted from 49 CFR §192.3 and that all offshore gas transmission lines be exempt from the final rule. Issues raised by INGAA to support its request for deletion of ``line section'' are lack of authority to promulgate such a rule and procedural error. INGAA points to technical infeasibility and impracticability to support its request for exemption of offshore gas transmission lines. The American Gas Association (AGA) filed a ``Request for Administrative Stay of the May 12, 1994 effective date and Petition for Reconsideration of RSPA's Final Rule on Passage of Instrumented Internal Inspection Devices.'' Arguing that immediate implementation would harm public safety by diverting funds from other safety projects, AGA requests that RSPA immediately stay the effective date with respect to replacement of line sections. In addition, AGA requests that RSPA grant reconsideration of the final rule in order to address the costs, benefits, and practicability of the replacement requirement to modify the complete line section to accommodate smart pigs. To support this, AGA argues that RSPA failed to consider the standards for pipeline safety rules set out in 49 U.S.C. §60102(b) (formerly section 3(a) of the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act); there was no opportunity for public comment on the definition of line section; the Technical Pipeline Safety Standards Committee (TPSSC) was not given opportunity to review relevant provisions; and the final rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The three documents submitted by INGAA and AGA are in the docket.
