An estimated 300-strong group of guerrillas attacked Rumchang in the Ampil district bordering Thailand early New Year's day, military officials said. The Khmer Rouge withdrew after several hours, the officials said, adding the government had sent reinforcements to the area. The attack took place as government troops were conducting an offensive on Khmer Rouge positions further west, near the border town of Poipet. Fighting had died down in the Poipet area Monday, but the situation remained tense after three days of battles between the government and the guerrillas, Thai army officials said. Prior to the May U.N.-organised elections which brought FUNCINPEC into a coalition government with their former Phnom Penh foe, the Cambodian People's Party, Rumchang served as a base for royalist troops and current co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh maintained a residence in the area. The prince's former residence was not burnt in the attack, a government official said. FUNCINPEC was in alliance with the Khmer Rouge throughout the 13- year civil war which was brought to a formal end by the signing of the Paris peace agreement in October 1991.
