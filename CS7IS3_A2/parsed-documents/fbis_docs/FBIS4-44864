A two-stage conditioning process developed by Wuppertal-based OeKa can be used to obtain a solid fuel from this matter, which is rich in phenol and aromatic hydrocarbons. If a lime-based storage mineral (Novomix) in suspension form is stirred into the tar, it both reduces the odor given off and creates an initial liquid fuel that can easily be piped off. In the second stage, Novomix-F is added continuously as a compacting agent, within a short time turning the tar into a solid substance matching raw lignite in appearance and calorific value. This material can consequently be burned along with lignite. The storage minerals' basic components bind the acid components of the flue gas during combustion. The process has been successfully tested in a pilot project supported by the Land of Brandenburg. The storage mineral, which OeKa Environmental Engineering developed together with various universities, can be used to immobilize pollutants found in gases, fluids, and solids.
