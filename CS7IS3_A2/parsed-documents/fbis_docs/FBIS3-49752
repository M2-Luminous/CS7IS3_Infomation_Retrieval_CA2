All Serb suburbs and Serb positions in the Sarajevo area were shelled by Moslems, the same sources state. Moslem forces in the region of the Moslem enclave Gorazde (eastern Bosnia) continue provocations with anti-aircraft and infantry weapons in the direction of the Serb positions, mainly in the direction of Foca. Moslem artillery also shelled Serb positions and civilian targets in the region of Doboj (north Bosnia) in the region of Srbobran and Gradacac (central Bosnia) on the Bihac-Krupa line (northern Bosnia), and around Kladanj and Olovo (central Bosnia). In the four-day clashes near Olovo the Serb forces Thursday afternoon succeeded in repulsing the Moslem forces who were heading towards the town itself.
