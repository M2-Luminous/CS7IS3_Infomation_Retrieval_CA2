FR940118-1-00034 FR940118-1-00007 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 300 [FRL&hyph;4827&hyph;5] National Priorities List for Uncontrolled Hazardous Waste Sites, Proposed Rule No. 16 AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (``CERCLA'' or ``the Act''), as amended, requires that the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (``NCP'') include a list of national priorities among the known releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants throughout the United States. The National Priorities List (``NPL'') constitutes this list. The Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'') proposes to add new sites to the NPL. This 16th proposed revision to the NPL includes 16 sites in the General Superfund Section and 10 in the Federal Facilities Section. The identification of a site for the NPL is intended primarily to guide EPA in determining which sites warrant further investigation to assess the nature and extent of public health and environmental risks associated with the site and to determine what CERCLA-financed remedial action(s), if any, may be appropriate. This action does not affect the 1,192 sites currently listed on the NPL (1,069 in the General Superfund Section and 123 in the Federal Facilities Section). However, it does increase the number of proposed sites to 97 (67 in the General Superfund Section and 30 in the Federal Facilities Section). Final and proposed sites now total 1,289. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before February 17, 1994, for Raymark Industries, Inc. (Stratford, Connecticut), Lower Ecorse Creek Dump (Wyandotte, Michigan) and Tennessee Products (Chattanooga, Tennessee) since these are sites being proposed based on ATSDR health advisory criteria and present immediate concerns. For the remaining sites in this proposal, comments must be submitted on or before March 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: Mail original and three copies of comments (no facsimiles or tapes) to Docket Coordinator, Headquarters; U.S. EPA CERCLA Docket Office; 5201; Waterside Mall; 401 M Street, SW.; Washington, DC 20460; 202/260&hyph;3046.

Introduction Background In 1980, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. 9601&hyph;9675 (``CERCLA'' or ``the Act'') in response to the dangers of uncontrolled hazardous waste sites. CERCLA was amended on October 17, 1986, by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (``SARA''), Public Law No. 99&hyph;499, 100 stat. 1613 et seq. To implement CERCLA, the Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'' or ``the Agency'') promulgated the revised National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (``NCP''), 40 CFR part 300, on July 16, 1982 (47 FR 31180), pursuant to CERCLA section 105 and Executive Order 12316 (46 FR 42237, August 20, 1981). The NCP sets forth the guidelines and procedures needed to respond under CERCLA to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. EPA has revised the NCP on several occasions, most recently on March 8, 1990 (55 FR 8666). Section 105(a)(8)(A) of CERCLA requires that the NCP include ``criteria for determining priorities among releases or threatened releases throughout the United States for the purpose of taking remedial action.'' As defined in CERCLA section 101(24), remedial action tends to be long-term in nature and involves response actions that are consistent with a permanent remedy for a release. Mechanisms for determining priorities for possible remedial actions financed by the Trust Fund established under CERCLA (commonly referred to as the ``Superfund'') and financed by other persons are included in the NCP in 40 CFR 300.425(c) (55 FR 8845, March 8, 1990). Under 40 CFR 300.425(c)(1), a site may be included on the NPL if it scores sufficiently high on the Hazard Ranking System (``HRS''), which is appendix A of 40 CFR part 300. On December 14, 1990 (55 FR 51532), EPA promulgated revisions to the HRS partly in response to CERCLA section 105(c), added by SARA. The revised HRS evaluates four pathways: ground water, surface water, soil exposure, and air. The HRS serves as a screening device to evaluate the relative potential of uncontrolled hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants to pose a threat to human health or the environment. Those sites that score 28.50 or greater on the HRS are eligible for the NPL. Under a second mechanism for adding sites to the NPL, each State may designate a single site as its top priority, regardless of the HRS score. This mechanism, provided by the NCP in 40 CFR 300.425(c)(2), requires that, to the extent practicable, the NPL include within the 100 highest priorities, one facility designated by each State representing the greatest danger to public health, welfare, or the environment among known facilities in the State.
