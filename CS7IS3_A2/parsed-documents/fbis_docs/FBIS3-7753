NATO has so far given only the basic elements about the operation carried out on Monday morning by U.S. Phantoms. The official NATO statement said that the operation took place at around 07:00 hours local time, and that two F-16s fighters shot down four aircraft near Banja Luka. No other facts are known for the time being. It is not known precisely which type of planes were downed, to whom they had belonged, and from where they had taken off. World media have neverthless been alleging since early morning that the planes belonged to the Bosnian Serb republic (R.S.), that they were Galebs, and had violated the U.N.-imposed no-fly zone over Bosnia-Herzegovina. Two categorical denials have so far come from the R.S. that the downed planes were not Bosnian Serb. The denials have not, however, stopped foreign media from alleging that they belonged to the Serb Republic. TANJUG was told in Bosnian Serb army (VRS) circles that the VRS had only one airfield, near Banja Luka, and that U.N. military observers had been stationed there for quite some time. The same sources underscored that U.N. military observers would have no doubt seen if any VRS planes had taken off from the airfield on Monday morning. The VRS sources denied that any VRS aircraft had been downed, which they said could be confirmed by U.N. military observers. Moslem-controlled Radio Sarajevo early on Monday morning said that Croat forces bombed the towns of Vitez and Novi Travnik, and that afterwards, at 06:15 hours local time to be exact, Serb planes raided the town of Bugojno. The same source said that Croat planes attacked the ammunition factory in Novi Travnik at 5:58 GMT, i.e. ten minutes after the downing of the allegedly Serb planes. Unidentified French military sources, which have been quoted by some foreign news agencies, have created additional confusion by alleging that the ammunition factory was bombed by Serb plames. Naturally, it is hard to believe that the missing elements concerning the four downed planes will not be filled in. However, things are repeating themselves. The Bosnian Serbs are again being blamed in advance, before the necessary facts have been established. The same was true in the case of the massacres in Sarajevo's Vase Miskina Street and again recently at Sarajevo's Markale open air market. The downing of the four planes on Monday morning was NATO's first combat operation since the military alliance was founded in 1949. Although the two U.N. Security Council resolutions relating to the no-fly zone over Bosnia-Herzegovina are invoked to justify the operation, it is a clear indication that NATO was not at all happy at not having had the opportunity militarily to act after the expiry of the NATO ultimatum set to the Bosnian Serbs. It has been conceded even in western political circles that the thwarting of NATO air strikes was Russia's diplomatic victory. The question which presents itself in that context is whether the Monday morning operation was an attempt to get even with Russia.
