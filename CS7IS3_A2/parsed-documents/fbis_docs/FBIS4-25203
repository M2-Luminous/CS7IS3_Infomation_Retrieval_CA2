[Enzhu] This visit marks the normalization of relations between France and China following the recent vicissitudes. This normalization should improve our economic and commercial relations, which I welcome. [Alia] Why did you react so harshly to France's sale of planes to Taiwan? The United States, which did the same thing, has not been ostracized by you in the same way. [Enzhu] Selling arms to Taiwan when you have diplomatic relations with us amounts to an attack on our sovereignty, to interference in our internal affairs. It is a matter of principle, and on this point we treat everybody in the same way. If unofficial or nongovernmental organizations do trade with Taiwan, we obviously cannot object. But we are opposed to any official contact between the countries which have recognized us and Taiwan. [Alia] Warren Christopher's recent visit does not seem to have done much to ease tension in Sino-American relations. Do you not think that the problem of human rights is casting a shadow over your international image? [Enzhu] Sino-American relations have improved markedly since the two presidents met in Seattle in November 1993. But it is obvious that our relations with the United States are not based on ideology or common values. They are based on the two sides' interests. We have close, if not identical, views on the settlement of regional and world conflicts. And Warren Christopher reaffirmed to us that the existence of a strong, stable, and prosperous China was in America's interests. [Alia] What would you do if the United States did not renew the most favored nation clause for China? [Enzhu] That would be a serious matter. Of course, China would suffer as a result, but so would the United States: Most exports of Chinese products to the United States are carried out by businessmen in Hong Kong and Taiwan, or by Sino-American joint ventures. If the clause of most favored nation was not renewed, American businessmen would be the first to suffer. [Alia] You have not given me an answer on the human rights question... [Enzhu] We refuse to link this question to other questions which have nothing to do with it, like the renewal of the most favored nation clause or our entry into GATT. It is a domestic problem. [Alia] Well, do not link it to anything, but let us discuss it nonetheless. Why do you refuse to bow to international pressure? Is China so weak that it cannot release a few dissidents and introduce greater democracy into its regime? [Enzhu] I would like to discuss this problem in general and not in the framework of the visit by an American leader. As you know, China has more than 1.2 billion inhabitants and our level of economic development is still fairly low. We have 30 provinces which are not all equally rich, and each represents virtually the equivalent of a West European country in numbers of inhabitants. Each year, there are 16 million new babies born, in other words the equivalent of the population of the Netherlands, 16 million additional citizens to whom food, healthcare, housing, education, transport, and jobs must be supplied! It is a very difficult task. We have already improved the living standards of hundreds of millions of Chinese and eradicated famine. And yet 80 million people still live below the poverty line in some remote regions of China. How can these many huge problems be tackled? We have decided that the main priority would be the economic development of the whole country. This is because improving the population's standard of living means ensuring the most basic of human rights, because we want above all to meet the mosts basic needs of 1.2 billion inhabitants. But this can only be done with order and political stability. Like any government, ours must strive to implement the law and maintain social order. This obviously leads to our punishing those who violate that law. That is why we hope that the Western countries, particularly the West European countries, far from ignoring it, will propose specific initiatives for China's stability. It is in their interest too: Between now and the end of the century, Chinese imports of machinery, consumer durables, transport equipment, energy, telecommunications equipment, and advanced technology are bound to increase. In all these spheres, France and the other West European countries have many assets... [Alia] At present, you seem to be excluding Britain, with which you are having discussions on the subject of Hong Kong. [Enzhu] Britain claims to want to develop democracy in Hong Kong, but it has dominated that territory for 150 years without practising any democracy: Until 1991, London directly appointed the members of the Hong Kong councils, and then only some of them were elected. Why is Britain so suddenly concerned to introduce a political system it has hitherto rejected? Why is it not honoring its pledges? To be able to continue to exert its influence. But, whatever happens, China will regain sovereignty over Hong Kong, as planned, on 1 July 1997, and what has happened before will be nul and void. [Alia] Will you change Hong Kong's political system? [Enzhu] We will carry out peaceful reunification according to the formula "one state, two systems" on which we have given a promise, in other words Hong Kong will continue to be an international financial center and a free port, and foreign commercial investments and interests will be protected by law there. [Alia] You have just signed similar protection agreements with Taiwan. Is this not tantamount to recognizing Taiwan? [Enzhu] Not at all. We have just given guarantees to the Taiwanese businessmen investing in China. Taiwan is still an integral part of Chinese territory. [Alia] Last October, you carried out a nuclear test, whereas France, Russia, and the United States had just decided to extend the moratorium on tests. Were you trying to issue a political warning or did you have technical reasons for acting in that way? [Enzhu] We carried out an underground nuclear test because, for a long period, we had stopped testing, which was a kind of de facto moratorium. Indeed, of all the nuclear countries, it is China which has carried out fewest tests. But we are still in favor of a total ban, if an agreement to this effect can be signed.
