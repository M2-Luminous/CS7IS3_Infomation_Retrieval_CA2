During his stay in Guilin, Zhao emphatically stated: State-owned enterprises should fully engage in market-oriented production, further tap latent potentialities, improve overall performance, and comprehensively raise economic efficiency. Over the last two years, Guilin City has energetically implemented a series of State Council regulations aimed at shifting operative mechanisms among industrial enterprises owned by the whole people, as well as all regional measures to this end, and carried out comprehensive enterprise reform in 35 enterprises on a trial basis with the result that some eight enterprises have been omprehensively transformed while seven others have trial-implemented an input-output contract system. Besides, 10 enterprises have either adopted on a trial basis the operative mechanism pertaining to township and town enterprises or managed their production in exactly the same way as township and town enterprises do. More than 40 enterprises in the region have also reorganized themselves into joint-stock companies with limited liabilities or companies with limited liabilities. These reform measures have been implemented with an eye to shifting enterprise operative mechanism and have infused fresh vitality into the region's state-owned industrial enterprises. Zhao fully affirmed Guilin's achievements with respect to reform and development in the last two years, saying: At present, we should make energetic efforts to push ahead with all types of reforms with a view to building a socialist market economic structure. Moreover, we should make continued efforts to delegate genuine operational decisionmaking powers to all enterprises, readjust industrial structures, improve the investment environment, invite more advanced foreign technology, step up cooperation with hinterland units, and absorb more foreign capital in order to accelerate technological transformation and new product development. Speaking of revitalizing state-owned enterprises, Zhao emphatically noted: First and foremost, we should conscientiously implement and carry out a recent State Economic and Trade Commission decision on unfolding activities of shifting operative mechanisms, improving management, tapping latent potentialities, and increasing efficiency among all enterprises across the country. To this end, all enterprises in the region should earnestly carry out market-oriented production, tap latent potentialities, further deepen labor, personnel, and distribution systems reforms, and establish an effective profit-related incentive mechanism and an effective profit-related restriction mechanism. Only by tapping latent potentialities will state-owned enterprises be able to demonstrate bright development prospects. So long as they make continue efforts to develop more readily marketable new products and constantly improve product quality, state-owned enterprises will certainly achieve excellent economic efficency; second, we should strive to push ahead with property rights system reform, establish a modern enterprise system conformable to a market economy, capable of separating functions of the government from those of the enterprise, and characterized by clearly defined property rights, responsibilities and powers, and by scientific management as well, this being a fundamental way out for state-owned enterprises. Enterprise property rights system reform, Zhao noted, can take a variety of forms, including implementation of a joint-stock system. Apart from implementing a joint-stock system, we should also try to set up companies with limited liabilities and implement a joint-stock cooperative system, transfer property rights by establishing joint venture enterprises, merging enterprises, or establishing large groups of companies. We should declare bankrupt on a trial basis and in accordance with the law a number of long-standing loss-making enterprises with no hope of recovery and even publicly auction a number of long-standing loss-making small enterprises incapable of repaying their debts. Nevertheless, these reform measures, Zhao said, should be tried in light of actual conditions in the enterprises concerned. Zhao also called for studying and working out reform measures suited to the region's specific enterprises in accordance with the state regulations concerned.
