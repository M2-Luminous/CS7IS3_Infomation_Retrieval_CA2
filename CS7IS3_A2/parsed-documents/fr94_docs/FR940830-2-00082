FR940830-2-00082 FR940830-2-00047 Public Health System Reporting Requirements: This program is not subject to the Public Health System Reporting Requirements. Promoting Nonuse of Tobacco: Studies have clearly established that the use of tobacco products increases mortality and morbidity, not only for the primary users of these products but for those in close proximity to the user. Statistics published by the National Cancer Institute indicate that cigarette smoking and chewing of tobacco are responsible for as many as 1,500 deaths per day in the United States. Recent studies conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency indicate that prolonged exposure to second-hand smoke significantly increases the probability of developing heart and lung disease. Consistent with its mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American people, it is the policy of PHS to strongly encourage all recipients of the PHS grants to provide a smoke-free work place and promote the nonuse of tobacco products. It is also the policy of PHS to encourage those recipients which already have a smoke-free work place and promote the nonuse of tobacco products to continue such practices. Particular attention should be given to avoiding exposure to secondary smoke by pregnant women and children. Additionally, CMHS strongly encourages all cooperative agreement applicants to implement policies and activities that promote the nonuse of tobacco products by clients/patients as a goal of treatment. Application Procedures: Completely separate applications must be submitted for Demonstration Sites and for the Coordinating Center. All applicants must use application form PHS 5161&hyph;1 (Rev. 7/92), which contains Standard Form 424 (face page).

Review Process: Applications submitted in response to this RFA will be reviewed for technical merit in accordance with established PHS/SAMHSA peer review procedures for grants. Applications that are accepted for review will be assigned to an Initial Review Group (IRG) composed primarily of non-Federal experts. Notification of the IRG's recommendation will be sent to the applicant upon completion of the initial review. In addition, the IRG recommendations on technical merit of applications will undergo a second level of review by the appropriate advisory council whose review may be based on policy considerations as well as technical merit. Applications may be considered for funding only if the advisory council concurs with the IRG's recommendation for approval. Review Criteria for Demonstration Site Applications: The points noted in the parentheses for each criterion indicate the maximum number of points the reviewers may assign to that criterion. These points will be used to calculate a raw score for each application. The raw score will be converted to the official priority score. Significance of the Project (30)
