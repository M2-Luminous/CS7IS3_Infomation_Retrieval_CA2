Vogel; place and date not given: "Uncertainty After the Civil War"] [Text] [Vogel] The differences between the rich and the poor are crass and seem to have increased. [Al-Hariri] In Lebanon there was a broad middle-class, which largely disappeared because of the war. Now it is recovering, but this will take some years. Reconstruction has begun: You see everywhere many projects and many building sites. The hope in financial circles is that the country will really take off. Many Lebanese are coming back and investing here. [Vogel] Several hundreds of thousands of expellees are also waiting for help; they do not notice any reconstruction. [Al-Hariri] My government is the first that is seriously taking care of them. We took thousands of families back to their places of origin. Now a bill that is to enable the government to spend $436 million on this has been presented in parliament. If the bill goes through, the problem might be solved in a few years. [Vogel] However, many refugees do not have much confidence in your government. They are saying that you are not concerned about the common people. [Al-Hariri] I cannot blame them. They are right if they feel ill at ease, but they are not right if they think that we do not take care of them. [Vogel] To put it mildly, unease can also be felt among the Christians. On 27 February, 10 men were killed and 60 injured by a bomb attack in the Maronite-Catholic Church of Suk Mikhail near Junieh. When you visited the site, you talked of the involvement of foreign powers, in order to divert international attention from the Hebron massacre (two days before). Your information minister even accused Israel directly. Are you sticking to this theory? [Al-Hariri] Even during the war -- it was a religious war -- nobody dared to attack a mosque or a church. The attack was an event that is far from the habits of the Lebanese. They were cruel, but they never did such a thing. [Vogel] Meanwhile, 127 people have been arrested. Does this not point to local perpetrators? [Al-Hariri] If a crime is committed and the police do not have any direct clues, they examine the suspects. Most were released after a few hours. [Vogel] You said yourself that certain forces still want to destroy Lebanon's fragile unity. What would be their motivation? [Al-Hariri] After a civil war, there is always uncertainty for a few years. There are people who want to overthrow the government in order to get into power themselves. [Vogel] That is to say, are you as a Sunni Muslim denying that the center of power in Lebanon is moving too far toward the Muslims and away from the Christians, as many Christians are claiming? [Al-Hariri] We are not trying to deprive the Christians of their power; we are trying to create a balance of power. [Vogel] You have another problem: Israel continues to occupy 10 percent of your country. [Al-Hariri] We are negotiating with the Israelis on their withdrawal. We are prepared to guarantee security at their border. It is for the Israelis to decide whether they want to be part of the Middle East or to dominate it. If they want to dominate, there will be no peace. [Vogel] Among other things, Israel is calling for the disarmament of the Hizballah militias. [Al-Hariri] The Israeli occupation is creating resistance. If Israel wants to withdraw from Lebanon, the Lebanese Government would be responsible for nobody trying any longer to disturb the peace. But as long as the occupation continues, I cannot keep the Lebanese from putting up resistance.
