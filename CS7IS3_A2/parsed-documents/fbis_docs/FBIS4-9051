The plant's first two reactors, which are 90 percent complete, were to have started operating by 1995, but now it appears they will not be ready until 2000. Work on the plant was interrupted last year due to a lack of money and the breakup of its supply system. The Economy Ministry and Slovak industry representatives are negotiating conditions for a loan to pay sub-contractors. Those from the Czech Republic who participated in the plant's construction, mainly through the Skoda Plzen engineering group, are owed 2.1 billion Slovak crowns. The Economy Ministry's Imrich Szitas said it appeared that Russia, the plant's likely future supplier of nuclear fuel, would provide a loan of 450 million USD. Preliminary talks between Economics Minister Peter Magvasi and Russian officials suggest that Slovak imports of fuel would be paid for with exports of Slovak goods. Talks are also being conducted with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and a consortium of Electricite de France and Bayernwerk of Germany on a possible loan of 1.3 billion marks that would be paid through supplies of electricity. Szitas denied that the EBRD made a loan conditional on the shutting down of a reactor at another Slovak nuclear plant, located in Jaslovske Bohunice, West Slovakia. It will be shut down once the Mochovce plant is completed, he said. The entire plant in Jaslovske Bohunice is undergoing changes to increase safety in a gradual process that is to be completed in 1997, Szitas noted.
