However great the temptation, we must nonetheless not be too quick to rejoice. According to official data published by the same Labor Ministry, last year the population's money incomes increased 9 percent. Evidently the incomes only of the section of the population whose incomes are 27 times higher than those of the lowest paid people. The main bulk of Russians (77 percent) had incomes lower than double the subsistence wage, which was 50,000 rubles [R] in December. One-third of this number were below even the subsistence wage. According to an expert assessment about 13 percent of people on low incomes were frankly suffering from malnutrition. If it is considered that things are no worse than in 1992, that means that a certain stabilization of incomes is taking place. Although specialists claim that new paupers have appeared in Russia. They are citizens who are perfectly able to work but whose incomes do not sustain any sort of life, since they are below the subsistence wage. The labor market situation looks like the calm before the storm. Official unemployment continues to be negligible and does not exceed 1 percent of the number of employed people. But so-called hidden unemployment is increasing -- according to various assessments, between 4 and 7 million people are not working full days or are on unpaid administrative leave. Wages are a headache for the government. This powerful engine of progress has lost all sense in our country. People in work are not happy because by December wages had increased 700 percent while prices had increased 900 percent. The government is concerned because the monthly wage increases are blatantly inflationary. Money is being pumped into the consumer market thanks to endless increases in prices for energy, transport, raw materials, and so on. Manpower is still cheap, but it seems that quantity and quality of labor will not be in demand as economic categories for a while yet. But a new phenomenon has been discovered. The average industrial wage is R140,000, while the average wage in, for example, commercial banks is R1.5 million. That is not all. Leaders of enterprises, even of those which have long had one foot in the grave, are concluding contracts with themselves and setting wages that are sometimes 100 times higher than the average wage of workers at the same enterprise. How can this be combated? It is rumored that the government intends to put an end to this outrage but does not yet know how to do it.
