Vucinic: "Volunteers by Force"] [Text] The story was first raised in the Serbian parliament. Milisav Petkovic, a Democratic Party deputy, said that a man who "has been a Serbian citizen for 10 years and was registered with his military authority in Serbia was taken to a school in Derventa where he was forced to sign a statement that he was willing to go to the front." "This story about volunteers" originates from Mali Zvornik and there is more than one person involved in it. According to witnesses, mostly wives of such "volunteers" who were taken away in the middle of the night, there are at least nine of them. It can be assumed that they are no longer alive. The secret of their correct number is hidden in a bus that took them away and it must also be known by "the official authorities." Judging by what we heard in Mali Zvornik, it seems that the bus was seen during the "guilty" night of 10-11 March 1994 only by occupants of a building on Ribarska Street in Mali Zvornik. The policeman on duty at the police station "did not know what the whole thing was about," and recommended that we talk to the police chief who was not there "at the moment." They Came "Two policemen with Serbian police badges came at one in the morning and knocked at the door. They wanted to speak to my husband and when he got up they told him to follow them to the Mali Zvornik police station so that 'they can put down some information.' I went to the terrace and saw that he was taken to a bus parked in front of the building," Ljiljana Andric, the wife of 37-year-old Radovan Andric, told us. Ljiljana and Radovan Andric have lived in Mali Zvornik, in the Srpska republic, since December 1991. Radovan Andric was employed by the aluminum oxide factory of Zvornik, now controlled by the military and civilian authorities of the Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Since they got an apartment in Mali Zvornik, Ljiljana and Radomir gave up their residence in Zvornik and were registered in Mali Zvornik. Ljiljana Andric told us that Radomir brought his military documentation to Mali Zvornik in the Srpska republic. She also told us that her husband remained employed on the other river bank, in another state. She said that he was very assiduous in doing his work and came home only once a week according to a new regulation. That he was a Serbian citizen made it impossible for the authorities of the Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina to mobilize him -- until the night of 10-11 March, 1994. "Nine of them from Ribarska Street 42 were caught like rabbits," Ljiljana Andric told us. While she was watching the scene from the balcony, she heard the bell ring for a second time. One of the policemen came back and offered her his company since she was "so lonely." Stevka has a similar story. Her husband Milan Lukic was taken away in the same way. "He did not protest when policemen asked for his papers. They said that everything would be over soon as they had done nothing wrong," Stevka says. Luka Vidovic was taken away early in the morning. His wife remained alone with their two children -- an 11-year-old daughter and a nine-year-old son, who was suffering from leukodistrophy. Borka told the children "Daddy has gone to pick up his salary," but they heard at school that their father had been arrested as a deserter. Borka lives on the ninth floor of a building in which the elevator is broken and she carries the sick children on her back even though she is afraid that her spine might break some day. She told us that the physicians and engineers who live below her were not bothered, although some of them had moved from Bosnia to Serbia after the building on Ribarska Street was completed. Across the Drina River "I realized that I cannot complain to anybody," Borka told us. "We went to the police, but we were told that they did not know anything about it." Slavica Mladenovic was given a certificate by the military headquarters in Mali Zvornik stating that her husband was registered in that commune, but she was allegedly told that that was a document of no significance in Zvornik. She was told by the Mali Zvornik police that they "had nothing to do with the case." A policeman was seen at Zvornik military headquarters who participated in this action. He "did not know anything," either. Authorities from both sides of the Drina River pretended that they had not been informed about the case until the nine men reached a telephone and called Derventa, a village between Milici and Vlasenica, telling their friends that they had been arrested and charged with desertion, adding that they would probably be sent to the front line near Srebrenica. Two of them who did not want to wear uniforms were beaten up. One of them was later released as unfit for duty. Luka Vidovic, who was exempt from military service in his military district because of his two sick children, was retained. In the meantime, the women visited their husbands who were accommodated in an abandoned school; they are waiting now. The news they receive is contradictory. According to some information, their husbands will come back, but, according to other information, they will be retained since the Republic of Serbia and the Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina have signed an agreement on the mobilization of former Bosnia-Herzegovina citizens. Borka Vidovic does not know whether or not such an agreement has really been reached, but she has the feeling that "the whole case must be based on this." Official sources have unofficially confirmed that the story about forceful mobilization in Mali Zvornik (Srpska republic) for the army of a neighboring state is correct.
