Has the agreement been signed yet? [Camilion] This agreement is almost closed. We believe all negotiations will be finalized in late April. The agreement includes the refurbishment of 36A 4M Skyhawk aircraft: 18 will be done in the United States and the rest in Argentina, in the Cordoba Materiel Area [AMC]. [Nole] Can you tell us about this dual program negotiation, because there are many versions. [Camilion] A Defense Ministry and Air Force delegation held talks with the Westinghouse company -- which will provide the celebrated radar installations -- with Pratt & Whitney -- which will supply the avionics -- and with Lockheed. Talks were also held with the U.S. Navy to renegotiate letters of intent originally agreed on over the refurbishing of a significant number of aircraft. Third, Lockheed has begun talks with the U.S. Smith Industries because we want that company to participate in this program. And, last, talks were held by the Defense Ministry with the Vought company to coordinate the Pampa 2000 aircraft project. [Nole] Who will run the former aircraft factory? [Camilion] The AMC property will not be transferred to anybody. It will be run by a group of companies that will be headed by Lockheed with the Air Forces' participation. [Nole] There were rumors that the purchase of these aircraft caused concern in Chile. [Camilion] I do not think the Chileans have anything to worry about. We discussed this subject at length with the former Chilean defense minister (Patricio Rojas). When he visited Argentina, he clearly said that Chile is not worried about Argentina buying Skyhawks and disclosed that Chile was buying Mirage interceptors. [Nole] Over the past few days there have been rumors about an aborted sale of cannons to Liberia whose final destination was, in truth, Croatia. Did this triangular weapons deal exist? [Camilion] No. The deal was exclusively with Liberia and was vetoed right from the beginning. We cannot sell anything to Croatia. There was a proposal to sell Pucara aircraft to Croatia, but it was turned down due to the international weapons embargo on the region. We were not aware of an embargo on Liberia, but the Foreign Ministry found the operation was not feasible because there was also a weapons embargo on that country. But let me make it clear that this sale was for Liberia and not for Croatia. [Nole] Where did the rumor on the interest in sending weapons to the former Yugoslavia come from? [Camilion] Those were mere speculations, although I must admit that I am personally interested in investigating their origin. [Nole] What sort of investigations has your ministry started regarding the participation of military men with guerrilla elements that held up an armored vehicle on the [Buenos Aires] beltway. [Camilion] We have obviously started an investigation and have been in contact with the SIDE [Army Intelligence Service]. This problem has worried us, we are investigating it, and what worries us most is a possible link between members of the Armed Forces with some intelligence service or criminal group. Our investigations are to determine if there are other connections. We cannot conduct more exhaustive investigations because the Defense Ministry cannot engage in domestic intelligence activities. That must be handled by the Interior Ministry and the Federal Police. [Nole] Naturally, but it is very worrisome that members of the Army and of the security forces act in an organized manner with criminal groups. [Camilion] Undoubtedly, although we believe the beltway case is an isolated case. We must be on the lookout to see if there are other connections, but we believe this was an isolated case and do not attribute to it -- despite the ideological mixture of the group -- any political implications. This is, essentially, a common case of delinquency. [Nole] Does the fact that many servicemen work for private security enterprises to obtain extra money have any effect on the three branches of the Armed Forces? [Camilion] This problem is worrying because the need for another job somewhat affects the Armed Forces' professional conduct. However, it is currently unavoidable due to the low salaries officers on duty earn and, consequently, this ministry and the Armed Forces have accept that this situation will remain a military reality for some time, that is, the need for the officers to have other jobs. [Nole] Armed Forces salaries have always been a polemic and much discussed subject between the Defense and Economy Ministries. [Camilion] This year's budget is considered reasonable, which does not mean the Armed Forces's salaries are satisfactory. We are not being subjected to any pressure or negotiations for salary increases for the civilian and military sectors. The 1994 budget remains unchanged. [Nole] How is your relationship with [Economy Minister Domingo] Cavallo? [Camilion] We have always rationally explained the Defense Ministry's needs to the economy minister and have always received rational answers. First, we have systematically organized Defense Ministry expenditures and so far have always had a positive response. There is no disagreement with the Economy Ministry. [Nole] Regarding drug trafficking, the United States seems to want to form a multinational force to fight this problem. Are you working on this? [Camilion] Argentina has two forces to fight trafficking; the Border Police and the Naval Coast Guard. This is why the Armed Forces have no reason or intention of participating in the struggle against trafficking as happens in other countries. Naturally, if circumstances justify it, we may cooperate by granting logistic support, but we do not want the Armed Forces involved in the struggle against trafficking, because the three branches do not want this. [Nole] Was there unrest within the Armed Forces over the arrival in Argentina of Italian prosecutors to investigate the disappearance of Italian citizens in our country? [Camilion] Yes, there was a lot of unrest. The Armed Forces were deeply concerned because they believed -- rightly so in my opinion -- that this could mean reopening a chapter which Argentina considers closed. It was considered that these investigations would reopen cases that have already been closed and would mean interfering with the three branches, with the legislative branch over the laws it dictates, with the federal chamber over the rulings it hands down; and the executive branch over the amnesty that it ordered. This chapter is regarded as closed and nobody wants it reopened through indirect channels. [Nole] My last question. Within the Armed Forces, are there any groups that favor a coup? [Camilion] None at all. The Armed Forces institutionalization process in Argentina is comprehensive. There is no chance of a military coup taking place in Argentina.
