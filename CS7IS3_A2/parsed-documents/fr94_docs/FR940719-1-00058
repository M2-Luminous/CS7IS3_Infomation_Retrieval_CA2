FR940719-1-00058 FR940719-1-00015 Since this standard went into effect in November 1992, the Agency has become aware of concerns suggesting that it is sometimes difficult to determine whether an intentional change in the air current could materially affect the safety or health of miners. However, MSHA regards it as impractical to follow a ``cookbook'' approach to identifying what will or will not require approval. Each circumstance is to be reviewed by the operator on its own merits. To illustrate the Agency's expectations, the following is a list of some examples of what MSHA considers intentional changes that would materially affect the safety or health of miners. These examples are not meant to include all possibilities, but are meant to provide some general guidance: adding a new shaft; bringing a new fan on line; changing the direction of air in an air course; changing the direction of air in a bleeder system; shutting down one fan in a multiple fan system; starting a new operating section with ventilating quantities redistributed from other sections of the mine; changing entries from intakes to returns and vice versa; and any change that affects the information required by §75.371, Mine ventilation plan; contents. The results of changes to a complex ventilation system are not always easy to predict, and for that reason caution must be used when making significant changes to one air split or several air splits. The balance of splits can be affected and may result in air reversals, dead air spaces, or insufficient air flow in critical areas. For this reason, such changes must be evaluated by a certified person examining the affected areas before production is resumed. Approval is required by paragraph (c) of §75.370 Mine ventilation plan; submission and approval, if the change alters the main air current in a manner that could materially affect the safety or health of miners. When questions arise as to whether an anticipated change requires prior approval, MSHA is available to discuss the situation for guidance on whether a request for approval should be submitted. While the Agency is not contemplating a change to §75.324 at this time, comments are specifically solicited on the issues discussed. Section 75.325␣Air Quantity Although the Agency believes that the promulgation of paragraph (d) of this standard was done appropriately, it is being reproposed for the purposes of receiving and giving consideration to all pertinent comments. Paragraph (d) would require that areas where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed be ventilated and that the quantity of air and the ventilation controls necessary to provide these quantities be specified in the approved ventilation plan. As demonstrated by the explosion at the William Station Mine, ventilation of these areas is essential and will greatly enhance the protection provided to miners. Section 75.330␣Face Ventilation Control Devices During the informational meetings and later discussions, it became apparent that members of the mining community were concerned about the appropriateness of using a performance standard relative to the volume of air that must be provided to working faces. It was suggested that such an approach suffered from two flaws: (1) By simply requiring sufficient air, a problem could develop and go unnoticed before corrective action is required; and (2) since most miners do not have the means for measuring ventilation parameters; i.e., anemometers and methane detectors, it may not be possible for the average miner to determine compliance with the performance standard. It has been suggested that in addition to the performance standard, the Agency should propose requirements for line brattice similar to those that existed in the previous regulation. After considering this recommendation in light of the expressed concerns, the Agency is proposing, in paragraph (c), that when a line brattice or other face ventilation control device is damaged to the extent that ventilation of the working face is inadequate, production activities would cease until necessary repairs are made. It is the intent of the Agency to assure that damaged ventilation controls are repaired and that mining is discontinued until adequate face ventilation is restored. Section 75.332␣Working Sections and Working Places Although the Agency believes that the promulgation of paragraph (a)(1) of this standard was done appropriately, it is being reproposed for the purposes of receiving and giving consideration to all pertinent comments. The ventilation of working areas has historically been accomplished through the use of a separate split of intake air. The proposal would provide this same level of protection to miners working in areas where equipment is being installed or removed. The Agency is not proposing any changes to §75.332 at this time. However, questions have come to the attention of the Agency concerning the existing standard. The following discussion is intended to address these questions. The existing requirements of §75.332 are largely derived from earlier MSHA regulations (§75.311 and §75.312). Under existing §75.332, air which has passed through any area not examined under §75.360, §75.361 or §75.364, or through any area which has been second mined, cannot be used to ventilate any working place. After the rule became effective, it was suggested that it would be possible to ventilate working places with intake air coursed through an evaluated, nonpillared worked-out area, because evaluation in lieu of travel to the point of deepest penetration is at some times acceptable under §75.364. As explained in the following discussion, this is not the case. Existing §75.332(a)(1) requires that each working section and each area where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed be ventilated by a separate split of ``intake air.'' Existing §75.301 defines return air as ``Air that has ventilated the last working place of any working section or any worked-out area, whether pillared or nonpillared *␣*␣*.'' Reading these two existing provisions together, one concludes that air that has ventilated a worked-out area is return air and therefore cannot be used to ventilate any working section or any area where equipment is being installed or removed.
