Kravchuk will "probably" use the visit to exchange letters ratifying the START-I strategic arms reduction treaty, said Anton Bouteiko, the president's adviser for international relations. US and Ukrainian officials will also discuss the "practical implementation" of a tripartite agreement on nuclear weapons signed on January 14 in Moscow by Kravchuk and US and Russian Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin, according to Bouteiko. The agreement calls for a total denuclearisation of Ukraine, which inherited Soviet nuclear weapons along with Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus. [passage omitted] "The main purpose of this visit to encourage economic and trade relations between Ukraine and the United States. We are not asking for aid but we want to attract investments," Bouteiko said. The Ukrainian delegation will propose 24 economic projects which are open to US investors, he said. Kravchuk will also meet senior officials of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. He will be accompanied to Washington by interim Prime Minister Efim Zviaginsky, Defence Minister Vitaly Radietsky and Foreign Minister Anatoly Zlenko.
