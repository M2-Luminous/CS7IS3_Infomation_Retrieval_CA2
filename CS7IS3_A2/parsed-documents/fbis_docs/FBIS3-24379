Batalova: "We Cannot Leave the People of Sevastopol Alone"; place and date not given] [Text] We are perhaps only just beginning to comprehend the extent of the tragedy. The tragedy of people who, at the whim of politicians, have ended up separated from their motherland, outside of their own country. It has singed Russians and our hometown Muscovites. Recall how proud we were to see points on the map of the Union named in honor of the capital. State farms named "Moskovskiy" and "Krasnopresnenskiy" were organized on the virgin lands of Kazakhstan: it was from Moscow railway stations that trainloads of young people departed to develop the virgin lands. We were proud that boys at the Moskva frontier post were guarding the country's borders. But could the soldiers of the Moskva frontier detachment ever have expected that the border would cross the hot Tajik-Afghan mountains? Could the virgin-land developers have imagined, even momentarily, that Moscow and their native Presnya would now be in another country? And now, at the center of political, not ocean, storms is the antisubmarine missile cruiser Moskva, a ship of the Black Sea Fleet. Each morning the command is given on board the cruiser, as it is on all the ships based in Sevastopol: "Hoist the flag!" And the flag of Russia unfurls over the fleet's ships. The sailors remain true to their oath of allegiance. To them the Black Sea Fleet is a Russian fleet, just as Sevastopol, city of Russian glory and great historical military traditions of the Russian state, is a Russian national shrine. Perhaps that is why one of the signs in Sevastopol greeting the Moscow delegation headed by Mayor Yu. Luzhkov bore the words: "Sevastopol--Moscow--Russia!" The delegation visited the city during Fatherland Defenders' Day. We asked Yuriy Mikhaylovich Luzhkov to comment on that visit. "First, the purpose of our visit. Our primary purpose was to meet with fellow Muscovites, sailors serving on the cruiser Moskva. That day we wanted to meet the crew of a ship which for many years has been under the patronage of the capital's enterprises and organizations whose names include the name Moscow. Muscovites fully realize how difficult it is to serve in the Black Sea Fleet, how difficult it is today for sailors and their families waiting for them on shore, how difficult it is for the people of Sevastopol. Our Il-76 plane delivered 30 tons of food gifts: sugar, canned meat, products of a Moscow cracker and dried lunch plant, cigarettes, toiletries. Personnel of the Moskva and Moskovskiy department stores prepared gifts for the sailors, officers and children. Our delegation included performers, and it was good to see how Moscow artists were received on the cruiser and at the Culture House. "In Sevastopol we keenly felt how much such meetings mean to people. We spoke with sailors and many inhabitants of the city: they spoke frankly of the situation developing in Sevastopol and around it. Indeed, how is that, in a city where the majority of the population are Russians for whom Russian is their native language, all business is conducted in the Ukrainian language and the people cannot view Russian TV programs? Currently there are only two Russian-language newspapers in Sevastopol, and radio broadcasts are also only in Ukrainian. Kindergartens, schools and other educational establishments are being Ukrainized. The Ukrainian authorities are doing all this contrary to the interests and desires of the bulk of the city population. "People may say that today Ukraine is an independent country with its own state language. But the thing is that Sevastopol is a very special city. In conversations with people we felt that they cannot conceive of themselves outside of Russia. They consider themselves a part of Russia. That is why people here respond so keenly and painfully to any injustice or ill-considered action of the administration. "Some may not like my words, some may protest, but I must say: our delegation gained the impression that the Ukrainian authorities were not too eager for us to meet with the people of Sevastopol, so the plane's landing was switched several times from one airfield to another. "Yet we were traveling to Sevastopol with the best intentions. We consider that Russians and Muscovites cannot leave the people of Sevastopol alone. They must help them resolve vitally important social problems. That is why we attended a ceremony to lay the foundation of a 100-apartment house, construction of which will be paid for with money provided by a Moscow construction complex. Sailors will receive housing already this year." "Will apartments in it be offered only to officers from the cruiser Moskva?" "Those from our protege cruiser first, of course. But the housing problem is so acute for the Black Sea Fleet that apartments will also probably be offered to others in need. "But I must say that resolution of the housing problem in Sevastopol is aggravated by the fact that politics is intervening in such a seemingly essentially public matter. Imagine an officer who needs an apartment, but he is a Russian officer and serves in the Russian navy; he is a Russian citizen, but to get an apartment he must become a Ukrainian citizen, because that country doesn't recognize dual citizenship. You can imagine what it means for a man of honor and duty to get a passport of another country. "I think it is necessary to formulate a special statute for Sevastopol. Without that it is impossible to resolve its problems and create suitable conditions for the sailors' military service. The Russian government must finally say its word. After all, the Black Sea Fleet protects the frontiers of Russia. It is a guarantor of peace in the Black Sea region. As for me, firstly, I will report our delegation's impressions of this visit to the president. Secondly, we have already appealed to the administration heads of 22 Russian regions whose representatives serve on ships and in units of the Black Sea Fleet, asking to help the sailors and people of Sevastopol in today's hard times: they should constantly feel that Russia is concerned for them and will not abandon them. That they are Russians."
