"These are the times in which our intelligence, our work ethic, and courage are necessary to produce as much sugar as possible," Sugar Industry Minister Nelson Torres Perez said on Tuesday in statements to official newspaper GRANMA. Torres asked agro-industrial workers to raise their spirits and not to give up in view of the heavy rains and floods, which paralyzed harvests in the eastern provinces of the island, where at least 10 persons lost their lives. Bridges, roads, thermoelectric plants, houses, and plantations were adversely affected by the heavy rains, which represented for the residents of the region a disaster similar to the one they suffered last November. The sugarcane harvest, which had been scheduled to end in April, was first extended until May, and now, according to official estimates, could be extended until June. The critical situation was foreseen in mid-April by Vice President Carlos Lage, who in an analysis meeting in Holguin Province described the sugarcane harvest situation as tense and difficult. Lage, the principal economic strategist, thereby changed the criteria he had set at the beginning of the year when he said that the 1994-95 harvest season would be greater than the present one and that the present one would be greater "by several hundred tons [as received] than the 1992-93 season." The water excess, in addition to obstructing the work of the scarce machinery that remains operating with the shortage of fuel, decreases the amount of sucrose in the sugarcane. Cuba registered in the last sugar cane harvest, its principal industry, the lowest production in three decades of only 4.2 million tons of sugar, which President Fidel Castro described as "a disaster." The drop in production, as compared to the 1991-92 harvest season, of 7 million tons, represented for the island a decrease in revenue of $500 million at a time when the country is facing a serious shortage of foreign exchange. "In July and August, nothing will stop...most of the sugar cane workers will remain in combat because there are no resources to perform work in other areas, including repair work" at the sugar mills, Torres said. "This effort we are making is not due to somebody's whim or to the proud search for an objective," the sugar industry minister said in the western city of Matanzas. The rains of the last 30 days in the Provinces of Guantanamo, Granma, Holguin, and Santiago de Cuba flooded hundreds of hectares and paralyzed the sugarcane harvest, which is also facing problems due to the lack of supplies. Torres suggested taking advantage of the momentary absence of rain to work in the flooded fields because "we cannot spare even a ton of sugar. The national economy and the commitments we have made require it." The Cuban Government has, for the past few weeks, made a dramatic effort, which included the deployment of thousands of workers with machetes -- cane cutters -- to step up production.
