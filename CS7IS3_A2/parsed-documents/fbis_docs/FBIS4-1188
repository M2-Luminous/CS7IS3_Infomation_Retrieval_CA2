A KwaZulu Police official in Ulundi confirmed the fighting. "Our men rushed to the scene of the fighting in Ulundi, but we don't have exact figures on the number of dead or injured. A senior official is coming here to deal with the media," he said from the KwaZulu Police pro [as received] headquarters in Ulundi. Both IFP and ANC officials confirmed the clashes, but differed in their versions of events. Earlier, IFP President Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi cut short an [Orange] Free State election roadshow on Saturday and rushed back to Ulundi, leaving hundreds of supporters waiting at a rally in Welkom. KwaZulu government Durban representative Rev Jabulani Mdlalose said the chief minister had been "summoned" back to Ulundi. In its version of events, the IFP said an ANC convoy was distributing pamphlets in downtown Ulundi and reportedly abused residents who did not want to accept the documents. "An altercation developed and ANC members opened fire on a group of residents. At this time the full extent of casualties is not known, however at least one resident, Siphiwe Ngcobo, was seriously wounded by ANC gunfire. "It has been reported that two ANC vehicles were then set on fire by angry residents," the IFP said. The incident, the IFP said, took place along the King Dinizulu Highway in Ulundi. The ANC in Johannesburg said it had received reports that two people may have died in the clashes. A Constable Vilikazi at the Ulundi police station confirmed that ANC canvassers were by 6.25PM still holed up in the station, where they were seeking sanctuary. Saying further details would be available from the KwaZulu Police pro, he added the ANC canvassers were being protected by the policemen there. "It is too sensitive, we are trying to save them. We are not allowed to say how many people are here. We are getting the right people to speak to you," he said, refusing to give his full name. ANC media spokesperson Carl Niehaus confirmed his organisation had received reports of fighting in Ulundi. "We demand an immediate response from the police and officials regulating the state of emergency in Natal on events today. We call on all parties to condemn all attacks and expose those preventing free and fair electioneering."
