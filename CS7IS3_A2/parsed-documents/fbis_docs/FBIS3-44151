In a telefax message signed in London today, the chairman and commander in chief of the organization, Mr. Sam Luwero, said the leadership of the alliance had also decided to dissolve the organization, close its offices in London and cease the publication of "Focus on Uganda" which has been the mouth-piece of the UNDA/UFA. The leadership of the UNDA/UFA had further decided to accept the Uganda Government's assurance that all former members of the UNDA/UFA shall not be prosecuted and are free to return and join other Ugandans to help the government in its task of democratic process presently going on in the country. In addition, the UNDA/UFA pledged their total solidarity with the Uganda Government in all its endeavors to establish a pragmatic process of true democracy in Uganda. The statement said the decision was in recognition of the fact that the NRM government has gone some way in trying to implement most of the elements encompassed in the UNDA manifesto of November 1991. The decision was also prompted by the fact that the people of Uganda are currently involved in an ongoing constitution-making process. The statement stressed that it is imperative that all peace-loving citizens in our country give (?this venture) a chance. The statement added that continued military action is no longer a viable option for the UNDA/UFA struggle. We must, the statement said, avoid turning our country into another Somalia, Liberia, or Bosnia. That is why the leadership of the UNDA/UFA said we (?heed) this directive. They instructed all members of the UNDA and officers and men of UFA to immediately observe an unconditional cessation of all hostilities against the NRM government.
