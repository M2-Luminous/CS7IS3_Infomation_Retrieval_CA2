FR941012-2-00006 FR941012-2-00002 For CV to purchase price comparisons, we made circumstance of sales adjustments for direct selling expenses including credit expenses. For CV to ESP comparisons, we made deductions, where appropriate, for direct selling expenses including credit expenses. We also deducted from CV the weighted-average indirect selling expenses, including inventory carrying costs up to the amount of indirect selling expenses incurred on U.S. sales, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(2). B. Grupo Benilda Because we found ``reasonable grounds to believe or suspect'' that Grupo Benilda sold roses in Colombia at prices below their COP, we initiated a COP investigation to determine whether it had home market sales that were made at less than their respective COPs, in accordance with section 773(b) of the Act. (See the September 8, 1994, memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford.) In accordance with section 773(b) of the Act, we examined whether Benilda sold roses below the cost of production in significant quantities over an extended period of time. In keeping with our practice involving perishable products, if more than 50 percent of Grupo Benilda's sales of roses, on a model-specific basis, were at prices above the COP, we did not disregard any below-cost sales pursuant to section 773(b) of the Act, because we determined that Grupo Benilda's below-cost sales were not made in substantial quantities within an extended period of time. (See Certain Fresh Winter Vegetables From Mexico 45 FR 20512 (1980).) If between 50 and 90 percent of Grupo Benilda's sales, on a model-specific basis, were at prices below the COP, and the below cost sales were made within an extended period of time, we disregarded only the below-cost sales. Where we found that more than 90 percent of Grupo Benilda's sales, on a model-specific basis, were at prices below the COP, we disregarded all sales and calculated FMV based on CV. In order to determine whether Grupo Benilda's home market sales were above the COP, we calculated COP based on the sum of Grupo Benilda's cost of cultivation, general expenses, and packing; we calculated CV based on the sum of Grupo Benilda's COP plus profit. For total general expenses, including selling and financial expenses, (SG&A) we used the greater of reported general expenses or the statutory minimum of ten percent of the cost of cultivation. For CV profit, we used the greater of the weighted-average reported profit during the POI or the statutory minimum of eight percent of the cost of cultivation and general expenses, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.50(a)(2) and section 773(e)(B) of the Act. We adjusted Grupo Benilda's COP and CV data to (1) correct an error in the company's calculation of average interest expense; (2) include the entire amount of the 1993 labor bonus; and (3) disallow the company's exclusion of certain G&A expenses.
