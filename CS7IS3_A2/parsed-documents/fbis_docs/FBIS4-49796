The results achieved in certain fields rank top in the world. Radioactive breeding, in particular, has been highly assessed by the International Nuclear Energency Agency. According to statistics, the 383 mutated fine seed strains which China has bred with radioactive breeding technology account for nearly one-third of the world's total seed strains bred by means of mutation induction, placing China on top of the world in this regard. As a result of radioactive breeding, China has come in control of a large number of distintive mutants that can promote early maturity, short stem, disease and degeneration resistance [kang ni 2123 6627], and fine quality, creating a gene bank for seed breeding. Currently the annual acreage for these new seed strains has been maintained at more than 9 million hectares; and the use of fine seed strains has increased the output of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops by nearly 5 billion kg and brought in more than 3 billion yuan of economic returns each year. The total value received from the higher output is 800 times of the total investment in the research. Following the introduction of the three nationally well-known new strains -- the "Lumian No. 1" cotton, the "Yuanfengzao" rice, and the "Tiefeng 18" soybean -- which won state awards, first class, for invention, China has again successfully bred the new rice strain, the "Zhefu 802," which has now become the most widely planted rice species in China. The application of radioactive breeding technology has now expanded from grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops to vegetables, fruits, mulberry, rubber, and flowers. By improving the "Xiangzaoru No. 1" glutinous rice, Hunan's scientists and technicians have tackled the species' problem of low yield; and now the rice species, which are of better quality and pest resistant, have become Hunan's dominant glutinous rice species and their use has expanded to 16 other provinces and regions, including Jiangxi, Guangxi, and Hubei. Because of their adaptability to north China's cold climate, the fast growing soybean and cold-resistant rubber species which China has successfully bred in recent years are growing in sizable parts in north China. The "Yuandong No. 3," a newly bred wheat strain, is resistant to rust disease, powdery mildew, aphid, dry and hot wind, and soil salinization. This extraordinary wheat strain that can ensure steady output is being introduced on sizable areas. Making insect pests infertile is a special application of nuclear technology in agriculture. The idea is to kill insect pests through letting loose male insects that have been made infertile with radiation so that female insects that mate with them cannot reproduce. Remarkable progress has already been made in this research project. To control fruit flies [da shi ying 1129 1395 5859] that menace tangerines, scientists and technicians once let loose 100,000 male flies that had been made infertile through radiation on a 500-mu experimental tangerine farm in Guizhou. Consequently the menace of the flies in the farm dropped from 5-8 percent to 0.005 percent. This virtually complete extinction has served as a basis for widespread application of the technique that makes insect pests infertile. The application of isotopic tracing technology in agriculture, which has substantially upgraded China's agricultural research, plays a significant part in guiding agricultural production. The results obtained from the research can be used for teaching farmers how to correctly and economically use fertilizers, and also can be used for studying how to prevent environmental pollution through understanding the residue of agricultural chemicals in plants and soil. Meanwhile, China has also succeeded in increasing the hatching and sprouting rates of soybeans and eggs of silk cocoons, carps, prawns, and in accelerating their growth and maturity through treating them with low-dosage radiation. Prawn output has now increased 15-20 percent, and silk output has increased 20 percent.
