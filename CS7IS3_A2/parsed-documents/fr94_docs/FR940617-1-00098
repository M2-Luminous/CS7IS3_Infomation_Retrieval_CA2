FR940617-1-00098 FR940617-1-00012 (B) The satisfactory performance of the test product as assessed by the results of the MIC studies, the time-kill studies, and the simulated in vivo clinical trials of organisms representing the resident microbial flora can then be used to assess the effectiveness of the test product for the transient microbial flora most commonly encountered in the clinical setting. This procedure is required because methods, other than the health-care personnel hand test, do not exist for assessing the in vivo effectiveness of test products versus the transient microbial flora. (C) It is recognized that a generally accepted or standardized method that may be used in conducting in vitro time-kill studies is not available, but the agency encourages the submission of proposed methods that may be considered applicable to this test. Many variables that should be considered in the development of a method have been addressed for antibiotics and are also applicable to these products. Such variables are described by Schoenknecht, F. D., L. D. Sabath, and C. Thornsberry, ``Susceptibility Tests: Special Tests,'' in the ``Manual of Clinical Microbiology,'' 4th ed., edited by E. H. Lennette et al., American Society for Microbiology, Washington, pp. 1,000&hyph;1,008, which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies are available from the American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC, or may be examined at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, 7520 Standish Pl., suite 201, Rockville, MD, or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol St. NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. (D) The procedure to be used is to incorporate the recommendations described on page 1,004 of the chapter in the ``Manual of Clinical Microbiology'' cited in paragraph (a)(1)(iv)(C) of this section with the following modifications. Because the time frames of greatest interest for antiseptic drug products intended for health-care personnel handwash, surgical hand scrub, and patient preoperative skin preparation use are 1 to 30 minutes, the time-kill studies are to focus on these time frames and are to include enumerations at times 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 20, and 30 minutes. Enumerate the bacteria in the sampling solution by a standard plate count procedure such as that described in ``Standard Methods for the Evaluation of Dairy Products'' (available from American Public Health Association, Inc., 1015 15th St. NW., Washington, DC 20005), but using soybean-casein digest agar and a suitable inactivator for the antimicrobial where necessary. The suitability of the inactivator is to be demonstrated using a procedure such as described in E 1054, ``Test Methods for Evaluating Inactivators of Antimicrobial Agents Used in Disinfectant, Sanitizer, and Antiseptic Products,'' in ``Annual Book of ASTM Standards,'' vol. 11.04, which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies are available from The American Society for Testing and Materials, 1916 Race St., Philadelphia, PA 19103&hyph;1187, or may be examined at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (HFD&hyph;810), 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD, or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol St. NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. The battery of organisms selected is to represent the resident microbial flora most commonly encountered under actual use conditions of the test product and the transient microbial flora most likely to be encountered by health-care professionals in clinical settings. Therefore, the micro-organisms to be used in these time-kill studies are to be the standard ATCC strains identified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section. The drug concentration to be tested should be a tenfold dilution of the finished product. (2) In vivo testing. The following tests, approximating use conditions for the clinical evaluation of each label claim of the finished product, are to be carried out using the finished product for the product classes specified. (i) Test method for the evaluation of surgical hand scrub drug products. The procedure to be used (paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section) is a modification of the standard testing procedure for the evaluation of surgical hand scrub drug products published by the American Society for Testing and Materials, ``Standard Method for Evaluation of Surgical Hand Scrub Formulation, Designation E 1115,'' in ``The Annual Book of ASTM Standards,'' vol. 11.04, American Society for Testing and Materials, Philadelphia, pp. 201&hyph;204, 1986, which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies are available from The American Society for Testing and Materials, 1916 Race St., Philadelphia, PA 19103&hyph;1187, or may be examined at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, 7520 Standish Pl., suite 201, Rockville, MD, or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol St. NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. (ii) Test method for the evaluation of health-care antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash drug products. The procedure to be used (paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section) is a modification of the standard testing procedure for the evaluation of health-care antiseptic handwash drug products published by the American Society for Testing and Materials, ``Standard Method for the Evaluation of Health Care Handwash Formulation, Designation E1174,'' in ``The Annual Book of ASTM Standards,'' vol. 11.04, American Society for Testing and Materials, Philadelphia, pp. 209&hyph;212, 1987, which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies are available from The American Society for Testing and Materials, 1916 Race St., Philadelphia, PA 19103&hyph;1187, or may be examined at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, 7520 Standish Pl., suite 201, Rockville, MD, or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol St. NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. (iii) Test method for the evaluation of patient preoperative skin preparation drug products. The procedure to be used (paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section) is a modification of the standard testing procedure for the evaluation of patient preoperative skin preparations published by the American Society for Testing and Materials, ``Standard Test Method for the Evaluation of a Patient Preoperative Skin Preparation, Designation 1173,'' in ``The Annual Book of ASTM Standards,'' vol. 11.04, American Society for Testing and Materials, Philadelphia, pp. 205&hyph;208, 1987, which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.

(b) Specific testing criteria _(1) Effectiveness testing of a surgical hand scrub. A surgical hand scrub drug product in finished form suitable for topical application will be recognized as effective provided that the formulated drug product at its recommended use concentration: (i) Contains an ingredient in ยง333.414 (a) or (b).
