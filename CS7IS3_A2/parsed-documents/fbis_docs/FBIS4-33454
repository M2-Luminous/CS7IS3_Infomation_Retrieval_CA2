We offer a synopsis of the text: The revolutionary government's agreement, which states that workers' cafeterias will cover costs with their own income, will become effective 1 July. The deadline may be extended until 31 August, based on exceptions for justifiable cases, to guarantee better implementation of the measure. The newspaper TRABAJADORES also stated in today's edition that it is therefore necessary to consider this measure closely linked with the efforts exerted [as heard] so that no cafeteria closes, which would be a severe blow to the workers and revolutionaries, wherever it occurs. Quite the contrary, the goal is to make the measure, in an effort to improve the product's quality, into a challenge -- even motivation -- during these difficult conditions in which a salary proves insufficient to fulfill this need. The newspaper then says the main idea on which to concentrate is that the government's measure strives to make cafeterias feasible -- that is, self-sufficient. Those that produce a profit will be able to use it to improve their own product. The TRABAJADORES editorial added: Another essential view is that once we know how much a cafeteria costs, we must struggle so its feasibility is the result of an improved product rather than a mechanical increase in prices. The TRABAJADORES editorial concluded: To fulfill this measure, which affects us so directly, in an exemplary way, will prove the steadfastness with which the Cuban labor movement endorses the policy we have outlined, including the participation of all workers, and which our government now implements to overcome the crisis and come out well ahead, stronger, and victorious.
