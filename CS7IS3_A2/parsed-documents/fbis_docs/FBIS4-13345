FBIS4-13345 "drnes076_c_94021" FBIS-NES-94-076 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 Egypt Poll Probes View of Arab-Israeli Relations Poll Probes View of Arab-Israeli Relations NC1504202294 NC1504202294 BFN [Editorial Report] Cairo AKHBAR AL-YAWM in Arabic on 9 April carries on its front page a 500-word summary of the results of a public opinion poll commissioned by AKHBAR AL-YAWM and carried out by the Administrative Development Center of Alexandria University's Commerce College. The poll deals with Egypt's regional policy, particularly its relations with Israel following the Cold War. On pages 3 through 6 the paper carries a 3,000-word report, illustrated with graphics, listing the questions and answers in the poll. On page 4 the paper writes: "This is the second time--the first was during the vote on a third presidential term--that the public opinion unit of the Administrative Development Center in the Commerce College of Alexandria University and AKHBAR AL-YAWM has cooperated in exploring public views on the strategy that Egypt should follow in light of new developments taking place during a critical juncture in the history of the Middle East." The paper notes that the poll was designed to shed light on the public response to an article by Chief Editor Ibrahim Sa'dah published on 26 January 1994 under the headline "Welcome to Challenge." The article was followed by a debate in the same paper among writers assessing the implications of the peace process. Sa'dah, the paper recalls, sees a "challenge" in which the country has to choose among the following courses: "1. Holding on to the cold peace with Israel until a comprehensive, just, and acceptable peace is achieved in the Arab region. "2. Turning the cold peace into a warm one and fully and promptly normalizing political and economic relations between Egypt and Israel, in view of the urgency with which others are moving to normalize their relations with Israel in one form or another. "3. [Selecting a course lying within] the spectrum defined by the two above-mentioned options." The pollsters, the paper explains, sent a three-part questionnaire to "a random sampling of 5,000 individuals from various parts of the country." To a question in part one of the questionnaire, 4,879 respondents, or 98 percent, say they read Sa'dah's article. Some 3,335 respondents, or 81 percent, say they agree with Sa'dah's call for "a new thinking in Egypt's relations with the countries in the region, including Israel." To questions in part two of the questionnaire, 3,885 respondents, or 94 percent, say they are "ready to get over the scars of Arab-Israeli relations and transcend the pain of the war." Those who are not ready to forget the past number 230, or 6 percent. Those who believe that "transforming relations between Egypt and Israel into warm cooperation is conditional on the signing by all parties of the peace agreements" number 3,250. Those who do not see a need for such a condition to be made number 865. [percentages not given] Some 3,916 respondents, or 95 percent, think that "Egypt's relations, communications, and cooperation with the countries of the region without exception should be conducted publicly." Those who do not share this belief number 199, or 5 percent. Agreeing that "Israel's repeated aggression reflects negatively on relations among the countries of the region" are 3,257 respondents, while 858 disagree. [percentages not given] Some 3,315 respondents, or 81 percent, believe that "the emergence of a Palestinian entity in accordance with the recent agreement will have a positive effect on relations within the region," while 800, or 19 percent, disagree. Those who believe that Egypt should "wait for the features of the new international order to take clear shape before it changes its current policy of maintaining a `cold peace' with Israel" number 261, while 3,845 respondents think that Egypt should not wait for this to happen. [percentages not given] Disagreeing with Menachem Begin's view that "peace could be achieved with Jewish brains and Arab money" are 3,969 respondents, or 96 percent. Some 146 respondents, or 4 percent, agree with Begin. Some 688 respondents, or 17 percent, think that Israel "should disavow its `from the Nile to the Euphrates' claim as a condition for cooperation and joint efforts." Those who see no need for Israel to disavow such a claim number 3,427, or 83 percent. Agreeing that "the Egyptian role in building a new regional peace and security system will diminish" are 154 respondents, while 3961 do not believe in a diminished Egyptian regional role. [percentages not given] Those who believe that Egypt "has dealt efficiently with the challenges of peace so far" number 3,416, or 83 percent. Some 3,586 respondents "believe they have stopped classifying countries in the region into foes and friends," while 529 still adhere to this categorization. [percentages not given] In the third part of the questionnaire, the respondents are asked the question: "What are the issues that you believe the important dialogue [commentaries written by intellectuals in response to Sa'dah's article] has left out?" The respondents cite the following issues: "1. The ability of the leaderships in the region to understand the new developments and deal with them intelligently and prudently. "2. The water problem. "3. Disarmament and regional mutual security arrangements. "4. GATT and its effect on Egypt and the region and the interaction of economic relations in the area."
