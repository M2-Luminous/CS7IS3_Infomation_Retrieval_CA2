The new parliament is more clever, more intellectual, and more politically competent than the previous body of Soviet power, Yeltsin said at a meeting with leaders of departments of the presidential administration that took place in the Kremlin Thursday [30 December]. The year was difficult, he said, but the country has had for the first time free elections and has a democratic Constitution. An Interfax correspondent reports that the president has stressed the need to improve the analytical work of the presidential apparatus. Emphasis should be put on the quality, not quantity, of materials prepared by experts, he said. The president has spoken out in favor of a reduced presidential apparatus. At the stage of discussions, he said all presidential staff members should advance proposals for decision-making, but once a decision is made, they should all be in agreement.
