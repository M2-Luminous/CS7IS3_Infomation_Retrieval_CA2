FR941128-0-00042 FR941128-0-00012 NWF asserts that the proposed rule is deficient because: (1) It is excessively permissive in delegating decision making to the regulatory authority without a meaningful check based on specified criteria or site characteristics guiding reductions in frequency; (2) there is an absence of binding criteria for ``tailoring'' inspection schedules for sites requiring more than the minimum one inspection per year, but less than currently required 12 per year; and (3) while OSM indicates in the preamble that regulatory authorities may subsequently readjust a reduced frequency as new information about the conditions at a site become available, there are no criteria for what would trigger such a readjustment. NWF agrees, however, for some abandoned sites, rigid adherence to the inspection requirements under Section 517(c) of the Act may be a poor expenditure of limited inspection resources and to the extent that the change to the definition of ``abandoned site'' enables regulatory authorities to make limited reductions in inspection frequencies without offending the language of Section 517(c), the rule is a sensible one. However, they state that any change to the definition of ``abandoned site'' in order to allow reductions in inspection frequencies must be accompanied by a comprehensive regulatory program such as that they outline below. They assert that failure of OSM to promulgate abandoned site inspection rules fitting this description would offend the purpose of the Act as a whole, even where the ``covered by each permit'' definitional change of ``abandoned site'' has rendered Section 517(c) no longer at issue. NWF asserts that, as part of their suggested program, any attempt to reduce inspection frequencies must begin by creating a categorical exclusion for which there can be no reduction from the existing requirements of 12 inspections per year. This exclusion should at a minimum include sites with potentially unstable structures, such as impoundments or hollow or valley fills, and sites with existing on-or-off site impacts, such as acid mine drainage. Moreover, NWF urged that, where abandoned sites are not categorically excluded from any reduction in inspection frequency, they should remain subject to an absolute minimum frequency of one complete inspection per year and not have their inspection frequencies eliminated altogether as the rule would allow. The comprehensive detailed inspection program suggested by NWF would also need to include the following: (1) Quantitative inspection requirements like the existing rule including an absolute minimum (e.g. one complete inspection per year); (2) a standardized or regionalized protocol so that criteria are applied consistently across different inspectors and different regulatory authority jurisdictions or regions; (3) specific written findings for all relevant on-and-off site performance standard parameters and public health and safety concerns; (4) based on quantitative inspection data charted over time, a published table for which the regulatory authority could proceed to the appropriate coordinates to determine the appropriate inspection frequency and trigger any necessary subsequent adjustments; and (5) traceable written documentation relating to inspection frequencies at abandoned sites amenable to administrative review. Finally, NWF's suggested comprehensive program also would include opportunities for structured public participation in the decision making process. NWF contends that OSM's regulation should begin with a rebuttable presumption that inspection frequencies should not be reduced from currently required levels unless that presumption can be overcome by an affirmative showing of reasonableness and general public notice, specific personal notice to identifiable parties that might be adversely affected by on-or-off site impacts, and public comment periods for all proposed changes in frequency. Also, if the regulatory authority demonstrates that a reduced frequency is appropriate, NWF asserts that there should be a general provision granting reasonable citizen access, when requested in writing, to inspect any areas of the site that would otherwise be inaccessible except to the regulatory authority. NWF charges that the absence of any discussion of why OSM has not developed a more comprehensive and structured abandoned sites inspection program is offensive to established principles of administrative law. Citing National Wildlife Federation v. Hodel, 839 F.2d 694 (1988), NWF points out that the court condemned precisely the type of conclusory rulemaking OSM has undertaken with its current proposal, ``The Secretary *␣*␣* if he determines that there is no need to `flesh out' the statute, must `flesh out' his explanations so that we can review the rationality of his decision.'' In light of this clear directive, NWF asserts OSM must at a minimum, repropose this rule and explain to the public why it is declining to establish a detailed regulatory program. OSM set forth an adequate explanation of its rationale underlying the proposed rule that has been greatly supplemented with the preamble discussion and response to comments in this final rule. OSM appreciates NWF's views and has decided to adopt most of the elements of NWF's program in this final rule. OSM will include in the final rule NWF's recommendation for an absolute minimum inspection frequency of not less than one complete inspection per calendar year, criteria for ``tailoring'' inspection schedules for sites requiring more than one inspection per year, and a requirement for specific and traceable written findings by the regulatory authority based on relevant environmental and public health and safety concerns and newspaper advertisement providing the opportunity for public comment on any proposed reduction in inspections of abandoned sites. These adopted provisions are discussed below and under the discussion of final §§840.11(h)(1)/842.11(f)(1). OSM considered, but is not adopting, NWF's request for quantitative fixed inspection frequencies in the form of categorical exclusions, standardized or regionalized protocols, published ``matrix'' tables, or public access to abandoned sites for inspection purposes in light of the opportunities already available under existing regulations. Under this final rule the responsibility for selection of the appropriate inspection frequency necessary to comply with this rule rests with the expertise and judgment of each regulatory authority, guided by specific written findings required in the final rule. With site-specific historical knowledge at hand and through their experience with local conditions and informal consultations with affected residents, the regulatory authorities are well qualified to identify sites with the potential for harm and to carefully tailor an appropriate inspection frequency for individual abandoned sites, each of which is unique, both in terms of its physical environment and the problems it presents. This rule will maintain the regulatory authority's responsibility for administering its regulatory program consistent with congressional intent to have primary regulatory authority rest with the States.
