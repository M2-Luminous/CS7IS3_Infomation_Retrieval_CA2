Wu Jiapei, deputy director of the State Information Center, said that China should seize the chance to develop the information market during the current reform drive. Now a vast number of institutions offer information services. At the least, there are 12,000 professionals in the state-run economic information system, which has branched into the country's 30 provinces, metropolises and autonomous regions. Statistics show that Shanghai, China's largest industrial city, boasts over 5,000 information organs, six-fold the number for 1991. Information departments have been set up in almost all industries. Moreover, information exchanges have increased. For example, trading volume reached 24.51 million yuan at an information meeting in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province last year. An expert from the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences said that China's reform drive has resulted in a soaring demand for information, which is considered key for companies to outpace their rivals. The information institutions also have to improve themselves to survive in tough competition. Many of them have provided specialized information, with some becoming authoritative consultants in certain industries. Meanwhile, more advanced equipment has quickened information delivery. With the development of the economic information market, legislation has topped the agenda in the field, with a set of national regulations in the making. North China's Hebei Province was the first in the country to formulate and enforce a set of regulations on the economic information market last December. Wu said there is still much room for improvement, as most information currently offered is regional and far from comprehensive.
