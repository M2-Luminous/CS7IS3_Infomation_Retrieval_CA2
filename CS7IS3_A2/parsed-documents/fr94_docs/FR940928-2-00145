FR940928-2-00145 FR940928-2-00075 2. Section 26(b) of the 1940 Act makes it unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding the security of a single issuer ``*␣*␣* to substitute another security for such security unless the Commission shall have approved such substitution. The Commission shall issue an order approving such substitution if the evidence establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of this title.'' 3. Applicants state that the purposes, terms, and conditions of the Substitution are consistent with the principals and purposes of Section 26(b), do not entail any of the abuses that Section 26(b) is designed to prevent, including costly forced redemptions, and are consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the 1940 Act. Applicants further state that the Substitution has been determined by Jefferson-Pilot to be in the best interests of Contract owners for the following reasons. 4. Applicants state that the objectives, policies and restrictions of the J&hyph;P Money Market Fund and the VIP Money Market Portfolio are substantially similar_both are money market funds that seek to comply with Rule 2a&hyph;7 under the 1940 Act. Further, given Rule 2a&hyph;7 requirements, the credit quality, maturity and diversification requirements applicable to each Fund are identical. 5. Applicants state that, due to the J&hyph;P Money Market Fund's relatively insignificant total net assets ($21,116,119 at March 31, 1994), J&hyph;P Management has had greater difficulty making appropriate investments than it would have had if that Fund had greater assets. Applicants submit that, due to the VIP Money Market Portfolio's larger asset size, it is not expected to experience the type of difficulties experienced by the J&hyph;P Money Market Fund with its smaller asset base in adhering to diversification requirements applicable to money market funds under Rule 2a&hyph;7. Additionally, Fidelity Management, the VIP Money Market Portfolio's investment adviser, has specialized in the management of mutual funds since 1946 and is a widely recognized expert in money management. 6. Applicants state that the expense ratio of the VIP Money Market Portfolio (.27%) is lower than that of the J&hyph;P Money Market Fund (.65%), which has remained relatively high for this type of fund. Further, because a large portion of the J&hyph;P Money Market Fund expenses is fixed and the size of the Fund is relatively small and unlikely to grow significantly, these fixed expenses currently represent, and may continue to represent, a relatively large percentage of the Fund's average daily net assets. In contrast, the expense ratio of the VIP Money Market Portfolio has remained at or near the .27% level for many years and is likely to continue to be lower because of the Portfolio's larger asset base. Consequently, Applicants assert that, following the Substitution, Contract owners will not be exposed to higher expenses and should benefit from the VIP Money Market Portfolio's lower expense ratio. Additionally, lower expense ratios generally indicate higher possible investment returns for Contract owners. For the seven days ended May 31, 1994, the yield and effective yield were 3.338% and 3.43%, respectively, for the J&hyph;P Money Market Fund, and 4.09% and 4.18%, respectively, for the VIP Money Market Portfolio. 7. Applicants states that the assets of the J&hyph;P Money Market Fund on March 31, 1994 were $21,116,119, and that the Fund has not exceeded a $25 million asset level during the past ten years ended March 31, 1994, a level that the Fund is not expected to exceed in the future. In comparison, the VIP Money Market Portfolio's assets at March 31, 1994 were $572 million and are expected to increase. Further, while shares of the VIP Money Market Portfolio are offered to separate accounts of insurance companies, whether or not affiliated with Fidelity Management, shares of the J&hyph;P Money Market Fund are actively marketed only to Jefferson-Pilot. Applicants thus submit that the VIP Money Market Portfolio is more likely to increase in size than the J&hyph;P Money Market Fund. 8. Applicant state that the Contracts reserve Jefferson-Pilot the right to replace shares of the J&hyph;P Money Market Fund held by the Separate Account with shares of another registered investment company, such as the VIP Fund, if (i) shares of the J&hyph;P Money Market Fund are no longer available for investment by the Separate Account, or (ii) in Jefferson-Pilot's judgment, subject to Commission approval, further investment in the J&hyph;P Money Market Fund should become inappropriate. Jefferson-Pilot represents that further investment in shares of the J&hyph;P Money Market Fund is no longer appropriate in view of the purposes of the Contracts. 9. Contract owners will incur no transfer fees in connection with the Substitution. Applicants represent that the Substitution will have no adverse federal income tax consequences for the Contract owners. Additionally, the Substitution will in no way alter the insurance benefits to Contract owners or the contractual obligations of Jefferson-Pilot. Contract owners will continue to look to Jefferson-Pilot with regard to their rights under the Contracts.
