SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On December 30, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the Federal Register (58 FR 69336) the preliminary results of administrative reviews of the antidumping finding on tapered roller bearings (TRBs), four inches or less in outside diameter, and components thereof, from Japan (41 FR 34374, August 18, 1976). We have now completed these reviews in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act). Scope of the Reviews Imports covered by these reviews are TRBs, four inches or less in outside diameter when assembled, including inner race or cone assemblies and outer races or cups, sold either as a unit or separately. During the review periods such merchandise was classifiable under item numbers 680.3932, 680.3934, and 680.3938 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated (TSUSA). This merchandise is currently classified under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) item numbers 8708.70.6060, 8708.99, and 8482.99.4510. These TSUSA and HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes only. The written description remains dispositive. These reviews cover TRB sales by Koyo Seiko Company, Ltd. (Koyo), for the periods 1979 through 1986, NSK Ltd. (formerly Nippon Seiko, K.K.) (NSK), for the periods 1980 through 1986, Mitsubishi Corp. (Mitsubishi), for the periods 1980 through 1985, Sumitomo Yale Co., Ltd. (Sumitomo Yale), for the periods 1980 through 1985, and Sumitomo Corporation (Sumitomo Corp.), Nachi-Fujikoshi, Niigata Converter, Toyosha, Toyota, Yamaha, Suzuki, and Maekawa Bearing Manufacturer (Maekawa), for the periods 1985 through 1986. Nachi-Fujikoshi and Niigata Converter claimed no shipments during the 1985&hyph;86 period of review (POR). Consequently, for both firms we have used each firm's rate from the last prior period in which they had shipments. Finally, as stated in the preliminary results, for these final results we are terminating the reviews of Nissan, Mazda (formerly Toyo Kogyo Co. Ltd.), and MC International.

We received written comments from petitioner, the Timken Company (Timken), and respondents NSK, Koyo, Mazda, and Sumitomo Corp. Rebuttal briefs were submitted by Timken, NSK, and Koyo.
