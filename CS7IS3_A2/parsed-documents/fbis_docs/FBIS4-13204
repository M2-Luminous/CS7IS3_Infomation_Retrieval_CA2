Once formally installed in office, the "board of executives" will meet one of the key demands of international donors and the World Bank which have been pressing the PLO for "credible" Palestinian institutions to channel aid to support the Palestinian self-rule envisaged under the Sept. 13 accord between Israel and the PLO. The executives will take direct charge of the nitty-gritty details of economy, such as customs and tariffs, taxation, social security, currency and monetary affairs as well as other aspects of financial administration of the occupied territories under the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction (PECDAR). In essence, PECDAR is expected to be the Palestinian ministry of finance in the occupied territories pending final-status negotiations with Israel after the interim period as stipulated in the September accord. The PLO officials said a PECDAR committee selected the executives, who will in effect be heads of departments, who had responded to advertisements in Jordan, Tunisia and the occupied territories. Many of the interviews were conducted in Amman early this month, they said. "The names of the successful candidates have been forwarded to the PLO leadership, and we are now awaiting approval from Tunis," where the PLO is headquartered, said a senior PLO official. But the official declined to characterise the recruits. But other PLO sources said most of those recommended by the interview committee were of Palestinian origin who have had extensive experience in financial administration in the Gulf states and elsewhere. "They more than meet the basic requirements and qualifications that enable them to be the key figures in the executive side of Palestinian nation-building," said one source. "Many of them have done [work] in the Gulf states, contributing to setting financial administrative structures there and made a success of it." The list of recruits has to be approved by PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, PLO officials said. The World Bank, which is directly in charge of channelling pledged international aid of up to $2.4 billion to help support Palestinian self-rule has been insisting that expertise, rather than political loyalties, guide the selection of key officials in the autonomy structure. Mr. 'Arafat chairs PECDAR. His immediate deputies are Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO's Political Department and the de facto foreign minister of Palestine and Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, head of the Economic Department of the PLO. Ahmad Quray' a PLO economic strategist and one of the key figures in the secret Oslo negotiations that led the autonomy accord, and Sari Nusaybah, a university professor from the occupied West Bank, are the senior-most executives of the 13-member council. Several other members who are professional economists have complained that 'Arafat loyalists rather than people with expertise dominate the council. Some of the critics have announced their suspension of membership in the council, but PLO officials said they had not submitted formal resignations. Among them are Dr. Yusuf Sayigh, a Beirut-based Palestinian economist who led the Palestinian side to multilateral talks on economic cooperation. Samir 'Abdallah, a noted professor of economics from a West Bank university and member of the multilateral group, has also been critical of the way the PLO leadership was handling its economic approach and the overall peace negotiations with Israel. The council is expected to meet soon in Tunisia to discuss practical measures to coordinate with the World Bank to channel aid to the self-rule areas, the PLO officials said. That meeting will be followed by the first meeting of the "board of executives" of PECDAR. The board will work under the direct supervision of PECDAR in implementing the decisions and policies of the council," said the PLO official. Jawad Naji, a member of the council and head of the PLO's economic department in Amman, said in a recent interview that the council estimates that it needs up to $400 million in the first year. The donors and the World Bank, in a meeting held in Paris in January, decided to allocate up to $160 million to the council. Dr. Naji noted that the allocation falls short of PLO estimates, but said the organisation hoped to secure further funds once self-rule is in place. "We have to start from scratch in the occupied territories," Dr. Naji said, referring to the almost total absence of self-supporting economic structure in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
