Build a Uniform Market Mechanism Under State Management and in Accordance With Socialist Orientations. Continued efforts must be made to build a new economic structure, bearing in mind the need to persist in the transition to the market mechanism while at the same time increasing the efficiency of state management. Steps must be taken to perfect apparatuses and policies to create necessary conditions for the market mechanism to operate effectively. It is necessary to guarantee the right of autonomy of businessmen. Prices should be set mainly by the market. Market indicators are very important factors for allocating resources to production and business establishments. It is important to adopt incentive measures to encourage everyone to compete in a legitimate and wholesome manner. Steps must be taken to limit monopoly. Business people have the right to earn profits in a legitimate way. The state only sets the prices of a small number of goods and services bearing a particularly important socioeconomic significance or having a highly exclusive nature. In any case, prices must all be set within the limits of the market mechanism. It is necessary to stabilize transporation costs and the prices of electricity, water, fuel, and oil. Steps must be taken to eliminate the system of providing subsidies for losses. It is important to regulate income distribution in a rational way and create conditions for expanding production facilities and for reducing waste of resources. It is necessary to abide by the principle of positive [laix duwowng] interests, closely monitor the rates of inflation, and create favorable conditions for both savings and loans. It is important to regulate currency exchange rates in a satisfactory manner, bearing in mind the need to see to it that the actual rates remain relatively stable but not rigid and henceforth, help promote exports and control imports. Plans must be worked out to determine fees and wages in a rational manner. It is necessary to formulate a selective subsidy policy for agricultural and export products. Appropriate measures must be taken to protect local products and the interests of both producers and consumers. Uniform steps must be taken to form various types of markets, products, services, labor resources, capital, technology, real estate, and so forth. It is necessary to step up state macro-management to direct and guide the overall performance of the national economy. Efforts must be made to create an economic environment and legal boundaries for production and business activities. Measures must be taken to develop positive factors, prevent or contain the adverse impact of spontaneous or negative actions, and overcome the inherent shortcomings of the market mechanism. Henceforth, these will cause the latter to become a really important instrument for distributing and making better use of all sources of strength as well as for distributing or redistributing the national income to guarantee equilibrium between revenue and spending, regulating the interests of the various economic sectors and people of all walks of life, meeting the growing demands of development, and ensuring social justice. The state macro-management system must cover all areas of the national economy and economic sectors instead of the state business sector only. It is necessary to strengthen the concentration and uniformity of government agencies when it comes to exercising macroeconomic management. At the same, it is necessary to increase the responsibilities and power of sectors and localities in case they can work out better solutions to the various problems involved. It is necessary to guarantee the right to autonomy of business establishments. Special ministerial agencies should devote efforts to carry out their functions as development project planners for economic and technological sectors under their charge satisfactorily. They should also provide direction, assistance, and supervision for operations of business establishments belonging to different economic sectors and in different areas of activity as specified under their state management functions. It is important to strengthen the role of interministerial agencies in overseeing the overall performance of all sectors and areas of operations, thus putting all socioeconomic activities under the state's effective macro-management system. Administrative organs at all levels should perform their state management functions in areas under their charge by overseeing the operations of business establishments belonging to different economic sectors, bearing in mind the need not to distinguish between central and local economic organizations. Steps must be taken to perfect the legal system to ensure strict observance of rules and regulations. Efforts must be made to consolidate and strengthen the advisory role of planning agencies so the latter can formulate good plans and projects to serve development goals, calculate and maintain a balanced macro-management system, adjust investment structures, effect economic restructuring, and serve as a venue for coordinating efforts to tap all sources of strength at home and abroad and make effective use of them to realize socioeconomic development goals. We must continue to reform the financial and monetary system fundamentally and comprehensively, while satisfactorily promoting economic activities to increase investment and development. We must strive to ensure uniform management of the national financial system, savings, and expenditure; improve financial work of the state, enterprises, and the population. Efforts should be made to improve budget management at the central and local levels to ensure sufficient allotments for normal expenditure, investment development, and national defense. We must mobilize capital at home and abroad, strive to meet immediate requirements, practice thrift, and promote investment development for long-term interest. We must encourage state-run enterprises to carry out autonomous financial management under close supervision and control by the state. We must strive to keep the budget deficit at lower than five percent of the GDP, make great efforts to increase state revenue to pay for expenditure, refrain from issuing banknotes to resolve the budget deficit, and strive to balance income and expenditure. Efforts must be made to reform the accounting system and improve auditing at the state and private sectors. The central state bank must formulate and implement the monetary policy to ensure effective allotment, transfer, and remittance of money; curb inflation; coordinate with financial, trade, and price agencies to maintain average annual price increase to single digits only; strive to balance international debt while increasing foreign currency reserves. The financial and banking sectors must satisfactorily carry out their functions of establishing funds, and effectively use and provide credits, and strive to meet requirements for economic development. This is to maintain their role as a center for the settlement and circulation of money within society. They must strive to improve the foreign currency management mechanism to create conditions for the Vietnamese dong to be effectively circulated and for it to become the sole currency for the settlement of debt nationwide. 4. Measures to resolve cultural and social issues: Our party and state's guiding thought in carrying out the cultural and social work is to care for, foster, and develop the human factor to create a driving force for revolutionary objectives. Efforts must be made to resolve various current issues to ensure social justice, enhance the people's intellect, promote a healthy atmosphere in society, and protect and develop our national cultural traits. To effectively create sufficient jobs for workers, the state and people must save money for investment development while satisfactorily implementing the socioeconomic strategy. They must encourage all economic components, citizens, and investors at home and abroad to expand branches and occupations to create more jobs for the laborers and reduce the number of unemployed workers, expand foreign trade, and promote the export of laborers. Efforts must be made to organize vocational training for youths to enhance their professional skills. For personnel and workers laid off by administrative agencies and economic units, we must reorganize and provide them with vocational training as well as loans to help them become involved in production and business or to find other jobs for them, while striving to set up consultative agencies to introduce new jobs. We must formulate laws to protect the legitimate interests of both employees and employers at private capitalist business establishments. The laws on labor, wages, insurance, and taxes have been and will be promulgated in accordance with investment promotion, the elimination of social injustice, and opposition against illegal businesses. The statutes, regulations, and disciplines for workers formulated by business establishments must not stand against state laws. It is necessary to say that the economic growth rate should be in parallel with social progress and justice at each stage of development. Social justice should cover areas such as the distribution of the means of production, income in accordance with results in production, and equal opportunity for each member of the production force to develop his ability. We must implement the principle of distributing more income to those who work and contribute more and vice versa, while striving to oppose mediocrity, and a dependence on others. We must ensure income is distributed in accordance with labor. We must encourage and treat competent and capable workers appropriately, and ensure a fair income for investment projects especially in production and business. We should encourage the people to amass wealth through honest means, while fighting poverty and hunger, motivate the rich to participate in economic development; formulate policies to rationally promote credit, taxation, vocational training to create conditions for the poor to be able to progress and to earn enough and become rich. Various former wealthy areas should, together with the state, assist the poor and underdeveloped areas. We must mobilize rich people to contribute in helping the poor by providing loans, equipment, and materials and in the transfer of experience and working methods. We should set up funds to repay those who have rendered meritorious services to the state, formulate appropriate policies for the rich, mobilize business enterprises and private organizations to participate in humanitarian and charitable activities to help the victims of war and natural calamities as well as the disabled, the aged, and the homeless who can no longer work. The responsibility of each citizen in solving their own individual and family problems should be heightened. At the same time, the common sharing of responsibilities in society in general should be intensified to develop our people's humanitarian tradition. The goals and measures set forth in the seventh party Central Committee Fourth Plenum Resolution on education and training, culture, the arts, public health care, and population and family planning work must be continued so that in a few years significant achievements can be recorded in our education service, thereby helping the education service fulfill its role in upgrading the people's mental abilities, creating the people's labor force, and improving the people's skills. At first, compulsory elementary education must be implemented. And, if possible, universal secondary education should be introduced in some localities. Policies to exempt and reduce school fees and provide suitable financial assistance must be applied to guarantee the education of children from poor families, especially those living in isolated, high, and former revolutionary base areas. Existing ethnic boarding schools must be consolidated and more boarding schools must be built. We must reorganize the vocational training system, upgrade the service provided by teachers' colleges, and rearrange the tertiary education system by linking academic training with vocational skills, study with practice, and training and research with production. National university centers must be built with improved goals, curriculums, and education methods to meet national development requirements. Planning for fostering and retraining the contingent of teachers must be established, policies to grant appropriate rewards to teachers must be introduced, and the state management of the education and training service must be strengthened.
