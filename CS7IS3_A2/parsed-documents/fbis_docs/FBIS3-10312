Robaina is accompanied by an official delegation from the Foreign Ministry [Minrex]. Robaina told journalists at Jose Marti International Airport that the trip will include seven Asian countries: Indonesia, Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia, India, Myanmar [Burma], and Vietnam. Robaina is seeking to spread the truth about the Cuban project. [Begin recording] [Pino] What are Minrex's expectations from these meetings? [Robaina] I believe the expectations are part of everything that has been done, I do not want to say in the last year, rather in the past. Nowadays we live at a faster tempo and thus we need to explain more energetically what we are doing and to keep abreast of what is happening in the world. I believe that Asia is no exception in this diplomatic offensive. I plan to listen to many opinions. I believe that there is much to learn from this part of the world and much to contribute. This is the main goal of the trip. [end recording]
