FR940526-0-00007 FR940526-0-00005 During March 28&hyph;31, 1994, eligible fire-cured (types 21&hyph;23) and dark air-cured (types 35&hyph;36) tobacco producers voted in separate referenda to determine whether such producers disapprove marketing quotas for the 1994, 1995, and 1996 marketing years (MYs) for these tobaccos. Of the producers voting, 89.8 percent favored marketing quotas for fire-cured tobacco and 90.0 percent favored marketing quotas for dark air-cured tobacco. Accordingly, quotas and price supports for both kinds are in effect for the 1994 MY. In accordance with section 312(a) of the 1938 Act, the Secretary of Agriculture is required to proclaim not later than March 1 of any MY with respect to any kind of tobacco, other than burley and flue-cured tobacco, a national marketing quota for any such kind of tobacco for each of the next three MYs if such MY is the last year of three consecutive years for which marketing quotas previously proclaimed will be in effect. With respect to both fire-cured (type 21&hyph;23) and dark air-cured (types 35&hyph;36) tobaccos, the 1993 MY is the last year of three such consecutive years. Accordingly, marketing quotas for fire-cured (types 21&hyph;23) and dark air-cured (types 35&hyph;36) tobaccos have been proclaimed for each of the three MYs beginning October 1, 1994; October 1, 1995; and October 1, 1996. Sections 312 and 313 of the 1938 Act also provide that the Secretary shall announce not later than March 1 of any MY the reserve supply level and the total supply of fire-cured (type 21), fire-cured (types 22&hyph;23), dark air-cured (types 35&hyph;36), Virginia sun-cured (type 37), cigar-filler and binder (types 42&hyph;44 and 53&hyph;55), and cigar-filler (type 46) tobaccos for the MY beginning October 1, 1993, and the amounts of the national marketing quotas, national acreage allotments, national acreage factors for apportioning the national acreage allotments (less reserves) to old farms, and the amounts of the national reserves and parts thereof available for (1) new farms and (2) making corrections and adjusting inequities in old farm allotments for fire-cured (type 21), fire-cured (types 22&hyph;23), dark air-cured (types 35&hyph;36), Virginia sun-cured (type 37), cigar-filler and binder (types 42&hyph;44 and 53&hyph;55), and cigar-filler (type 46) tobacco for the MY beginning October 1994. Price support is required to be made available for each crop of a kind of tobacco for which marketing quotas are in effect or for which marketing quotas have not been disapproved by producers. With respect to the 1994 crop of the six kinds of tobacco which are the subject of this rule, the respective maximum level of support is determined in accordance with section 106 of the 1949 Act. The announcement of the price support levels for the 1994 crops of the six kinds of tobacco must be made insofar as practicable before the beginning of the planting season. Marketing Quotas Section 312(b) of the 1938 Act provides, in part, that the amount of the national marketing quota for a kind of tobacco is the total quantity of that kind of tobacco which may be marketed that will make available during such MY a supply of such tobacco equal to the reserve supply level. Section 313(g) of the 1938 Act provides that the Secretary may convert the national marketing quota into a national acreage allotment for apportionment to individual farms. Since producers of these kinds of tobacco generally produce less than their respective national acreage allotments would allow, it has been determined that a larger quota would be necessary to make available production equal to the reserve supply level. The amount of the national marketing quota so announced may, not later than the following March 1, be increased by not more than 20 percent if the Secretary determines that such increase is necessary in order to meet market demands or to avoid undue restriction of marketings in adjusting the total supply to the reserve supply level. Section 301(b)(14)(B) of the 1938 Act defines ``reserve supply level'' as the normal supply, plus 5 percent thereof, to ensure a supply adequate to meet domestic consumption and export needs in years of drought, flood, or other adverse conditions, as well as in years of plenty. The ``normal supply'' is defined in section 301(b)(10)(B) of the 1938 Act as a normal year's domestic consumption and exports, plus 175 percent of a normal year's domestic use and 65 percent of a normal year's exports as an allowance for a normal year's carryover. A ``normal'' year's domestic consumption is defined in section 301(b)(11)(B) of the Act as the average quantity produced and consumed in the United States during the 10 MYs immediately preceding the MY in which such consumption is determined, adjusted for current trends in such consumption.
