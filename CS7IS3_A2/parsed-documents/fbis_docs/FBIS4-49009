Relatively young in years--Mr Xu is 38 and Mr Zhang is 40--both are potential successors to Mr Lu. Unlike their chief, however, both have previously done their best to keep a low profile. They seldom respond to questions from reporters at public functions and are therefore rarely sought for comment. However, January's high-level reshuffle at the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, which elevated both to their present posts, has thrown them into the spotlight. Mr Xu is now in charge of political affairs, which covers such crucial issues as the fate of the Legislative Council after 1997 and the future of the civil service, while Mr Zhang's economic remit includes responsibility for the Chek Lap Kok project. Their appointments were out of character for the Chinese bureaucracy, which normally appoints elderly cadres to such key posts. They are also highly unusual in that, unlike most mainland officials handling Hong Kong affairs, both are from Guangdong province and speak fluent Cantonese. Mr Xu, who is said to be highly regarded by Mr Lu, made his mark during last year's Sino- British negotiations on political reform. Although he did not take part in the 17 rounds of unsuccessful talks, he is believed to have played a key role in formulating the Chinese team's counter-proposals on Hong Kong's 1994-95 polls. At the time Mr Xu was deputy director of the Hong Kong affairs office's First Department, later renamed the Administration Department. In this position, he met a wide range of delegations from the territory, and accompanied Mr Lu to meetings with them whenever political affairs were on the agenda. The two rising stars were also classmates: they were part of the second batch of students to begin tertiary studies following the re-opening of mainland universities at the end of the Cultural Revolution. Admitted to the Chinese Language Department of Zhongshan University in Guangzhou in 1978, they joined the newly-formed Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office immediately after their graduation in 1982. Mr Zhang also did a stint as First Secretary at the Hong Kong office of the Chinese Joint Liaison Group team. He returned to Beijing in 1990 and later studied in Britain.
