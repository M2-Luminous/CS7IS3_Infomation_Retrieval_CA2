At around 0920 today, the South Korean puppets illegally brought and installed a 105-mm large-caliber gun 1,800- meters east of the Military Demarcation Line [MDL] Marker 0038 in front of Tongchang-ri, Panmun County, Kaesong City, from the direction of Paengnyong-ri, Paju County. They assumed the firing position toward our side and gravely irritated us. That the South Korean puppets openly brought a large-caliber gun into the DMZ in broad daylight is a preplanned provocation maneuver designed to artificially aggravate the situation in this area where armed forces of the two sides are being deployed acutely. Since such military provocation is perpetrated at a time when the U.S. imperialists and bellicose elements in the puppet military recently made frequent visits to the areas in the foremost frontline and instigated the frenzy for northward invasion, we cannot overlook this provocation. The South Korean puppets should correctly ponder the grave consequences to result from arms buildup maneuvers in the DMZ. They should not act rashly.
