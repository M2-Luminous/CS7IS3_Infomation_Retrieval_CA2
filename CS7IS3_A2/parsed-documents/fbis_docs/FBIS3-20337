Following the second round of the cantonal elections, which did not live up to all that the majority and especially the Matignon [prime minister's office] expected, Edouard Balladur yesterday called together the young leaders of the university and high school student movements which are organizing demonstrations against the CIP (Job Training Contracts). It was a two-hour working meeting which, although it did not defuse the student protest since Thursday's [24 March] protest meeting will take place, opens the door to an honorable compromise to replace the CIP rejected by the young people with another more appropriate system. This is a compromise which enables the government to come out with its head high from this social stalemate, while giving the young people guarantees of "good will." This is a strategic maneuver preceding the final withdrawal of the plan, which the Hotel Matignon wishes to approach in two stages: suspension of the CIP for a week, long enough to start negotiations with the representative organizations; replacement of the CIP after this period by another plan which will have been negotiated and approved. Government spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy said at the end of this working meeting that "the government does not intend to make the CIP a taboo. There are 750,000 unemployed people in France below the age of 25, in other words four times as many as in Germany. Of this figure, there are 690,000 young unemployed people without qualifications. We cannot tell them that we are no longer bothering with them." Therefore, because the CIP presents problems, "it must be replaced by a new formula which addresses youngsters' concerns. The government wishes to succeed" through consultation. "The negotiations are open and young people are not without imagination. All formulas are on the table. When there is good will...." The government is therefore proposing to reopen the issue on the basis of three points: 1. The CIP is suspended for one week. During this time, a mission headed by Michel Le Bon, director general of the ANPE [National Employment Agency], will work on drawing up a new formula in consultation with the employers' and employees' organizations and with representatives of the university and high school students. "Only detailed consultation and the support of the majority will make it possible to find a solution to the problem of youth unemployment," Edouard Balladur stresses. The prime minister is also putting forward the idea of setting up a job-seeking service for young people, which would be equivalent to a youth ANPE. 2. The prime minister wants a general meeting on youth held shortly because "its problems are not limited to employment." He therefore wishes to alert the public authorities, the local councils, the associations, and young people themselves to preparation for such a meeting. It will be organized in the coming weeks by an interministerial committee bringing together the government chief, National Education Minister Francois Bayrou, Higher Education Minister Francois Fillon, and Youth and Sports Minister Michele Alliot-Marie. 3. The government pledges to study new ways of establishing a dialogue with young people which "enables them to participate in a number of bodies, in which they are not currently represented." No `Revealed Truth' Young people have sent us several messages by demanding the abrogation of the CIP, Nicolas Sarkozy added. They are expressing "a desire for dialogue" and a need for recognition. "They are saying to us: Trust us, we have ideas too. We will not hold back this confidence." Under pressure on the one hand from a section of his majority to take a firm stance against the youth demonstrations and to speed up his reform program, and worried on the other about the risks of escalation prompted by the growing number of demonstrations, Mr. Balladur is seeking a way out which enables him to calm things down without giving the impression of "backing down." Last week, speaking to several journalists, he expressed surprise at the tension surrounding the CIP when there was no malice in the government's approach. He remarked that it was not his plan which was being booed in the streets, but the bill amended and rewritten by the deputies. "I do not identify with the idea of revealed truth," he said. "When you realize that a law" does not correspond to the country's expectations, and is not understood "it must be changed." But how to back down without giving the impression of crumbling under the pressure of a minority and without exposing yourself to the criticism of your political friends? The second round of the cantonal elections, which resulted in a drop in votes for the majority, gave him the opportunity to back down without risking too much criticism from a section of the majority. On Sunday evening, Mr. Balladur announced a series of initiatives to help young people. On Monday morning, he telephoned student leaders to invite them to come and talk. They arrived punctually. They put forward three preconditions for the opening of dialogue: withdrawal of the CIP; release of the imprisoned demonstrators; and return to France of the two Algerians expelled. "We have not come here to sidestep the issue," one of the 17 "guests" said as he entered the Matignon. And yet, aside from the FIDL [Independent Federation of High School Students] (organization close to the Socialist Party), which walked out after one hour of discussions, the other groups chose the path of negotiation. "I can only give you an answer on one point," Mr. Balladur told them in substance, "that of the CIP. The other two depend on the legal authorities and it is not for the government to exert any pressure." While maintaining "the pressure" in the schools and universities, the students agreed to participate in the proposed consultation. "We obtained partial satisfaction," Philippe Campinchi, from the UNEF-ID [National Union of French Students-Independent and Democratic]. "We welcome the government's change of tone... We say yes to the mission to extricate young people from unemployment and despair. It is a first step. It must be continued."
