To carry out domestic terrorism, Hoxha built a series of pill boxes throughout the fields and beaches of Albania. [passage omitted] Today Hoxha's "defense system" seems hilarious, but it worked effectively in justifying economic sacrifices and enforcing internal terrorism for decades. Berisha, who is a product of the same system, resorted to the same technique to justify a possible increase in "security measures" in North Epirus. The incident of the murder of two men at an Albanian military camp, if indeed it happened, appears to be a classic provocation or invention. The reports about the infiltration of persons in Greek uniforms who attacked the Albanian military camp reminds one of similar hoaxes by Hoxha's regime, who in 1983, for the last time, made allegations to the international public that foreign agents had invaded the Albanian coast. Their names were never made public, but the security authorities claimed that the suspects were masked and carried foreign currency, Greek drachmas and Italian lira. [passage omitted] The dominant view in Athens is that Berisha was encouraged by Western governments, with particular suspicion centering on Turkey, in order to launch this extremely powerful attack on Greece with verbal charges and letters to the Security Council. What is most probable though, is that the Albanian president attempted to capitalize on the prevailing negative climate to add one more charge that Greece is destabilizing the Balkans. Having limited political experience, however, he went beyond the tolerable limits, which reliable sources say prompted the United States and Germany to intervene to calm things down. This should finally lead to the resolution of the whole crisis, especially following Berisha's retreat on Thursday [14 April] when he noted that the Greek Government may not be completely responsible for the incident at Episkopi. Furthermore, Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi agreed to hold a meeting with Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, proposing 21 April in Bucharest. He said he is open to other dates and venues. In addition, Albania agreed to convene an experts' meeting--which had long been planned--and it will also deal with the border incident. The Albanians have not yet given a positive answer to the Greek Government's proposal for a meeting between the commanders of the Gjirokaster and Ioannina military units. Irrespective of the turn that the Greek-Albanian crisis has taken, however, it is clear by now that the situation could very easily get out of control with very serious consequences for the region's stability as well as the welfare of the Greek minority in Albania. It is clear that the Berisha regime is concerned not simply because of the so-called "politicization" of the minority, but mainly because of the activities of the Greeks which make them the most important economic factor in North Epirus and the whole of Albania. From this point of view, it is not a accidental that the Albanian authorities have recently arrested Greek businessmen for possessing foreign currency (Greek drachmas), changed the customs officials along the Greek-Albanian border, changed signs written in Greek, and exercised tremendous pressure on small businessmen and other residents of North Epirus. It is obvious that the issue of the Greek minority must be dealt with in a new framework, because it is not possible for the Greeks of Albania to be plunged from a being under police observation into being hostages to serve the domestic needs of the regime in Tirana. [passage omitted] Our country's policy toward the Greeks of Albania should have clear goals and firm in tone, and it should at least aim to safeguard all their rights as provided by international agreements. No government or political system in Greece can tolerate the enslavement of the North Epirus residents.
