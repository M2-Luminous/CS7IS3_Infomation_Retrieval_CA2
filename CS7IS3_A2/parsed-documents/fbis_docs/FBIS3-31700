"However, the conditions for reopening the airport cannot be those proposed by French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe," because "his scenario for RS is unacceptable," Buha told Novi Sad radio. Juppe has said that the west would even use force to reopen the Tuzla airport and threatened the Bosnian Serbs with NATO air strikes if they oppose this. "Isn't the experience of the Sarajevo ultimatum sufficient warning to Mr. Juppe," Buha asked. NATO threatened to launch air strikes against the warring sides in Sarajevo unless they withdraw their heavy artillery around Sarajevo to 20 km or place them under U.N. control but, in practice, these threats were directed against the local Serbs only. However, the Bosnian Serbs started pulling out their heavy weaponry from around Sarajevo on Friday only at the initiative of Moscow and after it guaranteed to deploy its U.N. troops along the separation line with the Moslems. The Bosnian Serb Republic agrees to reopen the Tuzla airport only if it receives guarantees that it will not be used to supply the Moslems with arms.
