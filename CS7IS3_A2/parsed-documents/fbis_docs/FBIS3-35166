He said, however, that this does not rule out the existence of a field agreement against the Zionist occupation. Replying to a question by AL-DUSTUR, he said: We welcome coordination with the struggling forces that are opposed to capitulatory agreements. We also welcome joint action in major jihad battles against the occupation troops and settlers. In a statement following his return from Damascus the day before yesterday, Ghawshah added: The central command of the Alliance of Palestinian Forces held two five-hour sessions and discussed the bylaws of the alliance and the organization [tartib] of the effective arenas in the occupied homeland, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan. He said: A major part of the meetings, held last Saturday and Sunday, was devoted to the political activation of the alliance on the official and popular levels as well as initial discussion of visits to some Arab countries by delegations of the alliance forces to explain their views toward the developments of the Palestine question. He added: We discussed the possibility of forming delegations to hold official meetings without specifying certain capitals or dates. Asked about the [PLO-Israeli] Cairo agreement, Ghawshah said: We have not discussed this issue seriously, but a joint statement in the name of the alliance will shortly be issued in this regard. Four Palestinian factions included in the alliance issued a statement a few days ago condemning the Cairo agreement, considering it a step in a series of submissions to the Israeli negotiating terms. Ghawshah indicated that the alliance's central committee members held a lengthy discussion on coordination and ways to bolster it in the occupied territory elections in the wake of the Gaza Doctors Union elections, in which the alliance was defeated due to lack of coordination. Answering a question on Yitzhaq Rabin's call on Hamas to engage in dialogue, he said: The occupation forces continue to seek dialogue with Hamas through some of its imprisoned leaders, but our principled political stand rejects dialogue with the occupation forces. The only dialogue lies in escalating the jihad operations and intifadah activities until the liberation of the Palestinian people, even if this takes scores of years.
