Ye Peida, head of the country's HD TV research team, said, "otherwise, China will lose a tremendous TV market and a golden opportunity to bolster its overall national strength with new technology." Ye is an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). Chinese and foreign experts have predicted that a global market worth several billion U.S. dollars for HD TV sets and related products will take shape by the end of this century. They expect a Chinese market of some 800,000 sets valued at 2.4 billion U.S. dollars a year by that time. Ye said that China has mapped out its strategic development goal for HD TVs, which stipulates that by around the year 2000 it will have set up an experimental telecasting station able to make some programs. By then China will also have grasped the technology necessary for HD TV systems and be able to develop and produce, although in small numbers, HD TV receivers. To achieve that goal, Ye said, China has drawn up detailed plans for two development stages: From now to 1996 China will pool efforts to tackle key technical problems and set up an experimental system for HD TV models. The following five years will see China go all out to develop HD TVs in an all-round way. He said that China is in a favorable position to develop HD TVs, as a digital telecommunications network characterized by optic cables, satellites and microwaves has been formed nationwide. According to him, the ministry of the electronics industry has established an HD TV research center, which conducts research on HD TV model receivers and satellite digital-data receiving systems in co-operation with the country's eight-largest TV enterprises, including the Changhong, Peony and Panda TV plants. The study of HD TVs has undergone great changes since Japan developed the world's first HD TV system in the 1970s. In 1991 the United States surprised the world with an all-digital HD TV system. Experts predict that hd tvs will become widespread by the year 2005. He Zuoxiu, a leading CAS physicist, said that the development of picture tubes and the manufacturing of macro-integrated circuits are the biggest difficulties in developing HD TV systems. "Once the technical problems are solved, HD TVs will have an immeasurable impact on a wide range of sectors, particularly on national defense, telecommunications, scientific research, medical science and the electronic printing industry," he noted.
