He made Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto the target of his criticism and used very harsh words. He said: Ms. Benazir Bhutto is turning away from realities. She has forgotton the atrocities committed on her own people and has lost touch with the culture of the subcontinent. She has also ignored the virtues of benevolence of Pakistan and India as well as of all religions. Otherwise, she would not have ordered the police to open fire on her own mother, brother, and kith and kin, who had gathered to pay homage to her father, the late prime minister, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. Shankar Dayal Sharma deserves respect for being the president of India and because of his diplomatic stature. But, he did not maintain the dignity of his post nor did he fulfill the demands of diplomtic norms. There is no justification for him making the person of Benazir Bhutto the target of his criticism. Benazir Bhutto and the Government of Pakistan have expressed solidarity with the people of Kashmir. They raised their voices of protest against the Indian occupation forces for perpetrating atrocities on Kashmiris and also informed world public opinion of the calamities and hardships befalling the Kashmiris. Do not the heart-rending facts produced by all neutral international organizations, human rights organizations, and mass media on the human rights violations in occupied Kashmir bear testimony to India's belligerant stand and its oppression of the Kashmiris? What did the Indian president unravel by referring to the 5 January incident in Larkana wherein only one person was killed? All the newspapers in Pakistan carried full details of the incident. The occurrence of the incident as well as the motives behind it do not remain hidden in any quarters. Can the Indian president cover up the massacres of thousands of Kashmiri men, women, and children? Can he deny the burning up of scores and hundreds of houses there? Obviously, he cannot do so. Is it the culture of the subcontinent to sidetrack from the pledges made at the time of the adoption of the UN resolutions to implement them? Is the forcible occupation of any region against the will of its people tantamount to the observance of the ideals of goodwill? For the information of the president, the Larkana incident, wherein only one life was lost, was the outcome of the clash between two groups of people. Neither the government nor the local administration has anything to do with it. Indian atrocities in occupied Kashmir are being discussed in all the world fora. What a terrible and abominable culture is it wherein Indian troops are committing excesses on the defenseless people of occupied Kashmir and are crushing their bodies, lives, and their human rights as well!
