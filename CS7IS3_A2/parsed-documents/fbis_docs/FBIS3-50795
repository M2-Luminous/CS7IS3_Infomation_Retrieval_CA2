"There is a climate of trust," one guerrilla source indicated. He added that at the meeting held this morning, Thursday, the two sides agreed on the agenda for the talks to reach a peace agreement in Guatemala. The source, however, refrained from revealing the points in the agenda. "We are advancing much more than we expected. The meeting has been very productive. The climate in cordial," a government source commented in regard to the preliminary meetings that are to last four days and which were called by the United Nations. The meetings, which are being held in a leading hotel in Mexico City, are attended by eight government members (three military officers, three civilians, and two advisers), three URNG Command representatives, two URNG Political-Diplomatic Commission delegates, and the UN-designated mediator Jean Arnault. The preliminary meetings, which were called at the request of the rebels and President Ramiro de Leon Carpio's government, are part of an effort to continue talks that were interrupted in 1993.
