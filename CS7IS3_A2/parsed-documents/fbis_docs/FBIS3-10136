A total of 439 legislators were present, and the measure passed with 372 votes in favor, 61 votes against, and six abstentions. The bill establishing the fund could be promulgated even tonight if a proposal put forth by Deputy Germano Rigotto is accepted. He proposed to vote on a request to give priority to a vote on the political chapter that includes the deadline for incompatibility, and then close the session. A new session could then be convened immediately afterwards to promulgate the Social Emergency Fund. In this case the decision would be published in the congressional newspaper tomorrow. Some political parties are concerned with the reduction of the period on incompatibility for running in the upcoming election. Rigotto's request was approved, although following a request to verify the quorum.
