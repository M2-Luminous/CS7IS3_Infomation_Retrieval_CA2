FR941110-0-00117 FR941110-0-00016 This anticipated damage to Mrs. Case, which is certainly serious, does not compare favorably with the government's interest in the safety of her patients. A nursing facility's ``need'' for patients has nothing to do with the statutory benefits structure. The facility's need is incidental. That a particular nursing facility cannot survive without Medicaid participation was certainly not Congress' foremost consideration in its creation of the Medicaid program. This is not to derogate Mrs. Case's property interest in her expectation of continued participation. We must, however, place that right in proper perspective with regard to the health and safety expectations of the patients, which expectations the Secretary has a valid interest in protecting. The benefits to a nursing home from its participation in Medicaid reimbursement result from nothing more than a statutory business relationship. The above comments on the relationship of providers to the Medicare and Medicaid programs were cited with approval by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in Geriatrics v. Harris, 640 F.2d 262, 265 cert denied, U.S. Supreme Court (1981). Comment: Several commenters offered alternatives to the proposed post-sanction hearings. Some accepted HCFA's goal of applying remedies immediately, but proposed that States should be allowed the flexibility to use pre-sanction hearings in limited circumstances. Some wanted the option to use pre-sanction hearings in cases where deficiencies are minor and States have a high caseload of appeals (presumably making it difficult to obtain a speedy post-remedy hearing); some wanted pre-sanction hearings in all cases unless the facility was substantially out of compliance or the deficiency was deemed life threatening. Some stated that although the residents' interests prevail when the deficiencies impair their safety, the facility's interests should prevail when the deficiencies are less serious, thereby justifying pre-sanction hearings. For example, some commenters agreed that substandard care needed to be addressed expeditiously, prior to any hearing, but other deficiencies could be addressed after an expedited appeals process. Some proposed a balancing test under which the procedures would vary according to the interests at stake. The residents' interests would specifically be balanced against the nursing home's interests on a case by case basis. A post-sanction hearing would be held in cases of immediate jeopardy, and pre-sanction hearings would be held when the threat to residents was less extreme. Some wanted States to have the option of providing pre-sanction hearings in all cases. Some wanted to retain the present State option in the Medicaid program to provide either pre-termination hearings or post-termination hearings which must be completed within 120 days of the effective date of the termination. A few commented that requiring completion of the hearing within 120 days would alleviate HCFA's concern that pre-sanction hearings would delay imposition of remedies. One commenter proposed that an existing State procedure be adopted, whereby the State schedules an appeal within 30 days of receiving a request for a hearing; an impartial decision maker makes a recommendation within 30 days of the hearing, and the Secretary makes a final decision within 10 days. Another proposed a 10 day filing period for requesting an appeal; a hearing held within 30 days of request; and a decision within 30 days of the hearing.
