FBIS4-698 "drafr072_c_94028" FBIS-AFR-94-072 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 14 Apr South African Press Review for 14 Apr MB1404120094 MB1404120094 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR `Increasingly Vociferous' Trade Unions -- "One of the first challenges facing an ANC-led government of national unity will be to deal with the increasingly vociferous public sector trade unions," notes a page-14 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 14 April. "If the new regime submits to threats of mass action, it will not be able to fulfill its ambitious programme of reconstruction and development." THE STAR notes that now South African Communist Party Chairman Joe Slovo "calls for a moratorium on strikes," and Cyril Ramaphosa, former general secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers, "urges similar restraint from striking workers. The irony is palpable." Their exhortations "contrast with their previous silence" when striking civil servants undermined the administrations "of their foes" in Bophuthatswana, Ciskei and kwaZulu. However, as the strikes spread to "pro-ANC polities, Transkei and Venda, causing chaos there, the proponents of mass action appeal for a halt." However, "with people dying in hospitals paralysed by strikes," Slovo and Ramaphosa's please "deserve support." "They should be reminded, however, that dreadful consequences ensue when dragon's teeth are sown." International Mediation -- A second editorial on the same page points out that "at the very moment that the international statesmen arrive to play their part," Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi calls a media conference to "complain about ANC and Government bullying." His arguments "appeared to boil down to one thing: the IFP's desire to have the election postponed and to use the mediation process to achieve this end. Has this become the IFP's chief objective?" The ANC and the government too "are not being entirely transparent in their approach to the mediation. Their tactics appear to have much to do with keeping a potential enemy engaged at the talks table and thus denying it the opportunity to engage in open conflict -- at least until well after the election. The mediators, men of high repute, have travelled a long way -- but they must already be wondering if they were wise to come." BUSINESS DAY International Mediation, Buthelezi -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 14 April in a page-12 editorial remarks that two events "threaten fatally to undermine Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's claims that he is the injured party in South Africa's political process." "The first was his unconditional rejection of the ANC's offer on the status of the Zulu king made at the four-way summit meeting last Friday. The second occurred yesterday when, against recommendations of his own negotiators and the international mediators, he threatened to scupper the mediation process unless it permits discussion of the postponement of the election." BUSINESS DAY believes that postponement of the election "is simply not an option." "The present government has lost the ability to rule and the country could descend into anarchy without a legitimate authority in place by the end of the month." If Buthelezi chooses to use the election issue to block the mediation process, "it will be difficult to argue against those who contend that he is not seriously seeking a constitutional settlement compatible with modern democracy." The "cynical view of Buthelezi is buttressed by his rejection of the ANC's offer to the king. An offer to the king of ceremonial and traditional powers is appropriate. If Buthelezi is, as seems to be the case, demanding legislative powers for an unelected monarch, that would support those who believe his priority is not a settlement but perpetual crisis. And if Buthelezi blocks mediation using the pretext of an election postponement, that would confirm it." BEELD Mediation Cannot Resolve Buthelezi-Zwelithini `Negativity' -- South African elections will take place over a little more than two weeks and a tragedy of epic proportions is unfolding before us. All the role players can see the signs but there is still an unwillingness, or inability, to do something about it," begins a page-8 editorial in Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 11 April. "South Africans should not be led to believe that the situation will improve on its own. This is what people thought about Bophuthatswana until we had the bloody outburst." "The situation will only improve if there is the political will to find a solution." "Instead of a spirit of reconciliation at Friday's summit at the Kruger National Park we witnessed confrontation." "The end of the Buthelezi government is in sight. If the king decides to declare war then he will be engaging in a futile battle which could be more catastrophic for his people than rule by colonial superpowers and indigenous white governments. It seems that a collective stupidity, no longer in the interests of South Africa or the Zulus, characterizes the Zwelithini-Buthelezi campaign. One cannot see how international mediation can resolve this negativity, even with the best will in the world." "We can only hope that every South African leader will wrestle with his conscience in the days ahead and will find the path of reconciliation and understanding so that a disaster can be avoided."
