They believe that the establishment of a 50-seat minimum during the formation of factions will lead to the centrist parties being defeated and to the opposition playing a domineering role in the parliament. The sitting of the State Duma, which opened at Moscow's Mayoralty this morning, focused on the struggle around the establishment of the minimum number of seats in a faction. While representatives of democratic groups favour a 20- or even a 14-seat minimum, the LDPR, the Communist party, the Agrarian party, and the Democratic Party of Russia advocate the introduction of a 50-seat minimum.
