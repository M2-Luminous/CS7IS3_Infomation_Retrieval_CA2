FR940721-1-00004 FR940721-1-00002 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;62&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;30 and &hyph;30F Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;30 and &hyph;30F series airplanes. This proposal would require replacement of cargo door latch spool fitting attach bolts fabricated from H&hyph;11 steel with Inconel bolts. This proposal is prompted by a report of a broken latch spool fitting attach bolt found on a cargo door on a Model DC&hyph;9 series freighter airplane. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent inadvertent opening of a cargo door while the airplane is in flight, and subsequent loss of pressurization and reduced controllability of the airplane. DATES: Comments must be received by October 10, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;62&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments, specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;62&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;62&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion On April 26, 1991, the FAA issued AD 91&hyph;10&hyph;07, amendment 39&hyph;6991 (56 FR 21268), applicable to McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes, manufacturer's fuselage numbers 1 through 379 inclusive. That AD requires inspection of the cargo door latch spool fitting attach bolts fabricated from H&hyph;11 steel and replacement of those bolts with Inconel bolts. That action was prompted by a report of a broken latch spool fitting attach bolt found on a cargo door on a Model DC&hyph;9 series freighter airplane. Broken bolts could jeopardize the integrity of the door locking capability. The requirements of AD 91&hyph;10&hyph;07 are intended to prevent loss of pressurization and reduced controllability of the aircraft due to inadvertent opening of a cargo door while the airplane is in flight. Since the issuance of AD 91&hyph;10&hyph;07, the manufacturer has informed the FAA that cargo door latch spool fitting attach bolts fabricated from H&hyph;11 steel also were installed on 8 additional Model DC&hyph;10 production airplanes. Therefore, these 8 airplanes are subject to the same unsafe condition as addressed by that AD. The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;10 Alert Service Bulletin A52&hyph;212, Revision 4, dated November 3, 1993, that describes procedures for replacement of the H&hyph;11 cargo door latch spool fitting attach bolts and associated hardware with Inconel bolts and associated hardware. Replacing the existing H&hyph;11 material bolts and associated hardware with new bolts made from Inconel material and associated hardware will eliminate the possibility of stress corrosion failures. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require replacement of H&hyph;11 cargo door latch spool fitting attach bolts with Inconel bolts on 8 Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;30 and &hyph;30F series airplanes. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously. Note: The FAA's normal policy is that, when an AD requires a substantive change, such as a change in its applicability, the ``old'' AD is superseded by being removed from the system and a new AD added. In the case of this AD action, the FAA normally would have proposed superseding AD 91&hyph;10&hyph;07 to expand its applicability to include the 8 additional airplanes. However, in reconsideration of the entire fleet size that would be affected by such a supersedure action, and the consequent workload associated with revising maintenance record entries, the FAA has determined that a less burdensome approach is to issue a separate AD applicable only to the 8 airplanes. This AD does not supersede AD 91&hyph;10&hyph;07; airplanes listed in the applicability of AD 91&hyph;10&hyph;07 continue to be required to comply with the requirements of that AD. This proposed AD is a separate AD action, and would be applicable only to eight airplanes listed in the alert service bulletin described above. There are 8 Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 6 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 86 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $10,682 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $92,472, or $15,412 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.
