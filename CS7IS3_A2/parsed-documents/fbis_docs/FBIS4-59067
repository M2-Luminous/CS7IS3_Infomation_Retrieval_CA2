He added that what is helping our Armed Forces decide the situation militarily against the secessionist elements in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] is the fact that large numbers of the forces that were under the control of these elements have joined the ranks of the forces of unity and legitimacy. In a news conference held today, which was attended by a number of Arab and international newspaper, news agency, and radio correspondents, he said that the Armed Forces are now close to the area of Dar Sa'd, overlooking the city of Aden, and that they are continuing their advance toward the dens of the gang that rebelled against legitimacy. He pointed out that the situation in the governorate of Abyan was decided in favor of our Armed Forces on the day before yesterday, and that fighting has come to a complete halt in all combat areas in this governorate. Fighting is now confined to the governorates of Lahij and Aden, where the forces of unity and legitimacy will soon finish their tasks in the two governorates. In this regard, brother 'Abd-al-Ghani asserted that the military base under the control of rebels and secessionists in the area of al-'And in the governorate of Lahij is about to fall into the hands of the Armed Forces, which are conducting a firm siege on this base. He denounced the criminal action that the rebellious and secessionist gang is carrying out by launching missile attacks on the capital, Sanaa, and on the governorates of Ta'izz and al-Hudaydah. These attacks targeted national and vital institutions. The objectives they sought by shelling these institutions were not achieved, and their evil wish foundered, so the missiles fell on mountains, hills, and valleys, as well as on some residential areas, he added. Asked about the mediation efforts of certain states, the brother Presidential Council member said: For our part, we always announced that we support dialogue; we called for dialogue, and we committed ourselves to its results. We are also constantly committed to democratic policy, the constitution, and legitimacy. However, the rebellious and secessionist leaders in the YSP rejected dialogue. We now reject foreign mediations because what is taking place is an internal affair between legitimacy and those rebelling against it. Moreover, we vehemently reject mediation efforts that regard the conflict as one between two different regimes. This is because the conflict is one, the country is one, and the legitimacy exists in the House of Representatives, which was elected by the people on 27 April 1993. Within this context, brother 'Abd-al-Ghani expressed great appreciation for the sentiments of the Arab brethren and friends throughout the world toward what is happening in our country. He asserted that there would be a Yemeni solution to the problem because the conflict is one between legitimacy and the rebellion against it. The world states should support legitimacy and democracy in our country, he added.
