The program includes the elimination of investments in new projects and programs, except for those projects considered to be of utmost importance. According to the decree issued by the government of conservative President Sixto Duran-Ballen, the procurement of new domestic and foreign loans now depends on the existence of specific financing. The government will not agree to any international commitments, agreements, or contracts without first ensuring the existence of funds, and commercial contracts will only be signed once it has been verified that dependable domestic or foreign financing exists to support them.
