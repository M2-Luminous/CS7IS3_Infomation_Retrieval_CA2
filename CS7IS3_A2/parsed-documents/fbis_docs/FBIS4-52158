Ishida said in a press conference that Nagano's "extremely regrettable" remarks that the 1937 Nanjing massacre never happened and that Japan was not an aggressor in World War II "greatly impacted China and other Asian countries." "So it's only natural that he took responsibility for it," he said. Nagano, a 71-year-old member of the coalition's core party Shinseito and former military serviceman, resigned on Saturday after holding the post of justice minister for only 10 days. He was replaced by Hiroshi Nakai of the Democratic Socialist Party. Ishida suggested that Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata undertake some kind of political overture vis-a-vis China in order to put bilateral relations back on a firm footing. He refuted criticism that the Nagano incident reflects the allegedly hawkish nature of the Hata cabinet and said that Nagano's remark was a personal observation. In a separate press conference, Defense Agency Director General Atsushi Kanda said Nagano's remarks were "inappropriate," particularly so in light of the fact that it has recently become the government's clearly established view that Japan waged a war of aggression during World War II.
