We imagine how important this meeting will be, particularly since measures will be taken against the settlers, or, at least, the extremist ones. Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin supplied us with important information. We asked him about the nature of the measures the Rabin government could take tomorrow. [Beilin] Well, I prefer to wait for tomorrow, because decisions will be taken tomorrow. But, I can already say that, for the first time, there was a curfew on an Israeli settlement in the West Bank. It never happened in the past, and I think that we should see whether there are some legal ways to outlaw those very extreme organizations which went out saying that they should act in a violent way against the peace process. [Announcer] As for disarming the settlers, as Palestinians are calling for, Yosi Beilin believes this demand is not realistic. [Beilin] I do not believe this demand is a realistic one. After all, after so many years, we are going to have in the territories, in Gaza and Jericho, a strong Palestinian police. I do not think it is possible and reasonable, when this police will be armed, to disarm the settlers after 26 years. What is important is to prevent the dangerous among them to be armed, and to go for a full solution, so that in the future, something like that will not happen. I think that if any such demand is becoming a condition, it will just delay the process and will be the best prize for those who would not like to see a peace process in our part of the world. [Announcer] There is another Palestinian demand expressed by Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] and Faruq Qaddumi in his interview with our radio, that of sending international forces to protect the Palestinians. Here too, the Israeli deputy foreign minister does not believe this demand is a wise one. [Beilin] I do not believe that now, on the verge of the implementation of the Oslo agreement, it would be wise on both sides to invite international forces. But, you have to take into consideration that in Oslo, we agreed together that as part of the implementation of the agreement, there would be an international presence in the autonomy. So, I do not believe that now speaking about something which is different from that is a wise thing to do.
