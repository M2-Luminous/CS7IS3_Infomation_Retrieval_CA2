[Stetka] Following President Clinton's visit to Prague, how do you view the possibilities for military cooperation among the Visegrad countries? [Baudys] The Visegrad grouping is -- from our point of view -- obsolete. Bulgaria, Romania, and the Baltic states are applying for membership of NATO; perhaps even Slovenia will join them. These countries are asking justifiably, why Visegrad and not us? Close military cooperation among the Visegrad countries narrows down the issue unacceptably. Partnership for Peace is an individual plan, and, therefore, an absolutely correct one. On the other hand, the Czech Republic is the most active propagator of economic cooperation in Central Europe. In my opinion, associating entry into NATO with military cooperation among the Visegrad countries is nonsense. [Stetka] What do you think of Poland's reservations about alleged Czech individualism? [Baudys] I understand President Walesa, because his country borders directly on Belarus and the Kaliningrad Oblast, where there is a large concentration of Russian troops. The question is, of course, whether all the members of the Polish cabinet share Walesa's views. [Stetka] Do you know anything specific yet about Czech participation in Partnership for Peace? [Baudys] Naturally, we have an idea, because we were consulted on the project in advance. We are planning a six-month course for the military experts who will represent us in NATO headquarters. Last year, we planned joint exercises involving Czech units and a French company and now, within the framework of the Partnership, we are also planning exercises with the Dutch. They will be held this year. It is possible that they will be held in our country.
