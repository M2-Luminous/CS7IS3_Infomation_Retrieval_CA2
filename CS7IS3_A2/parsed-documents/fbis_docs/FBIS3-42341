In the opinion of the ministry, the political isolation of the armed groups has been reinforced, while progress has been made in disrupting the operations of their principal factions. The goal for 1994 and 1995 is to take further steps toward neutralizing once and for all the organizations that practice political violence in Chile. Another element that was emphasized in the official report is the fact that in 1993 there were no selective murders, such as those that took the lives of Senator Jaime Guzman and the bodyguards of Metropolitan Intendent [mayor] Luis Pareto. It also predicted that the next phase of the government's strategy will be to isolate the so-called "combatant jail" by building a high-security facility to house terrorist leaders so that they cannot continue to exert influence over the operative cadres that are still free. Before presenting a preliminary report on the matter, Luis Toro, attorney for the Interior Ministry, stated that that public entity is preparing an overall report on the results of the antiterrorist struggle over the past few months. A few days ago, Justice Minister Francisco Cumplido hailed the accomplishments of the government and law enforcement in this area, noting that now there are about 80 members of the Manuel Rodriguez Front and the Lautaro Movement who are being held and prosecuted for various crimes that are subversive in nature. Without citing specific figures, Toro ventured to say that there has been a significant decline in terrorist activities in the last year. He also emphasized that several major criminal actions were discovered in advance. The official indicated that perhaps one of the most serious situations to arise in this regard took place last October when terrorists tried to rob a bank in Las Condes. The ensuing clash with police forces resulted in eight casualties. Another negative development that he mentioned is the various opinions on how much involvement Chilean citizen Sergio Olea Gaona had in the assassination of Senator Jaime Guzman. The case is awaiting judgment in Division 3 of the Supreme Court. Toro noted, however, that major progress has been made in investigating the assassination of the man who founded the Independent Democratic Union (UDI). Some of the conspirators and perpetrators of the assassination have already been arrested, including Front members Mauricio Hernandez Norambuena ("Commander Ramiro") and Ricardo Palma Salamanca ("El Negro"), for whom life sentences have been requested. Except for the case of Olea Gaona, the Interior Ministry attorney stressed that the vast majority of the cases prosecuted by the ministry have culminated in guilty verdicts in the higher courts after two or three years. In his opinion, this is proof that the government's evidence is solid and conclusive. In addition, the government official noted that in the last 12 months, forces have been successful in breaking up the central structure of terrorist factions such as the "Raul Pellegrin Detachment," a military wing of the autonomous Manuel Rodriguez Front. He also cited as an accomplishment of the government the eradication of other political-criminal groups such as the People in Arms Movement. He explained that these are bands made up of former members of terrorist groups who are collaborating with common criminals to carry out their actions. He further contended that the Lautaro group is still suffering major losses in its upper ranks, with the capture of the number-two man in the Lautaro Popular Liberation Forces (FRPL), Claudio Melgarejo Chavez, and later of Delfin Diaz, both members of the top leadership. As a result, the noose has been tightened around the head of the organization, Guillermo Ossandon Canas ("Diego Carvajal"), who still has ties with inexperienced members. "The government's strategy called for an initial phase of politically isolating the terrorist groups, so that the police could then proceed to break them up. That phase is still in progress," he indicated. The official explained that the next step in the immediate future is to isolate the "combatant jail" by opening a maximum-security prison facility inside the former Santiago Penitentiary to house persons convicted of terrorist offenses committed after 11 March 1990. "This is something that terrorist groups are very fearful of, because it would mean that their principal leaders in custody would be precluded from exerting any strategic or tactical influence over cadres who are currently free," he emphasized. He acknowledged, however, that it cannot be said yet that the subversive groups have been neutralized. "This year we will consolidate the great progress we have made toward breaking them up, and we plan to have them neutralized sometime during 1995," he indicated. He explained that the strategy of politically isolating terrorists has been manifested in the gradual severing of ties between these bands and the more traditional left, the widespread condemnation of their actions, and the shunning of the most active militants. Despite this optimistic official approach, various civilian sectors and political opposition organizations have constantly questioned the administration's ability to deal with the issue of citizen security in general, and political violence in particular. The criticism has focused primarily on the Coalition's erroneous conclusion that normalizing democratic life alone would reduce terrorist activity, and on the other hand, the fact that it has sent the wrong signal by granting pardons to people convicted of this type of crime. The latter situation has been aggravated by the president's decision to commute life sentences to exile in Europe for members of extremist organizations that participated in actions resulting in the death of law enforcement personnel, such as the assault on the Lautaro Bakery and the armed attack on the Los Quenes Reserve Post. A total of 19 people have had their sentences commuted to exile. Another 14 individuals are still serving time for subversive offenses; of those, four are candidates for pardon, including the gunmen who attacked Gen. Augusto Pinochet's presidential entourage. Another case has not yet applied for a pardon, and the others are awaiting conviction to be eligible. The last prisoner to receive a presidential pardon, having his sentence commuted to 20 years in exile, was Hugo Gomez Pena, sentenced to 35 years in prison for the death of Carabinero Miguel Vasquez Tobar on 18 April 1986. He went to Belgium on 22 December. During the Aylwin administration, 435 prisoners convicted of subversive offenses have been released. In addition to stressing the negative signal these pardons send, as officials strive to develop an effective strategy against terrorism, political leaders and parliamentarians concerned with this issue also note that certain government circles and the political coalition that backs the government have failed to show consistent political support for the work of the police.
