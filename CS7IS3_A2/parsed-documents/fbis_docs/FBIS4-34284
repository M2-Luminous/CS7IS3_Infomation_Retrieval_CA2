The two countries are located in the vast geopolitical space created by the River Plate basin, which has a history that in many aspects unites them and in other cases separates them, giving each country its own and distinct personality. However, they also have shared economic interests that soon will materialize in Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. As is common in all families, relations between the two nations have had their ups and downs. But if we have to make a list of elements that have not contributed to our family's harmony, it is probable that we will make a rather short list and include mostly minor items and some prejudices, which are unjustified but inevitable in peoples' relations. An outstanding place in the list probably will be occupied by the important and delicate issue of the administration and use of the River Plate. The issue is not new. It started with the Montevideo and Buenos Aires ports' rivalry during the vice royalty. The suspicions and concerns rooted in the origins of our shared history were stirred by an extraordinary theory maintained by an Argentine foreign minister at the beginning of the century. Estanislao Zevallos maintained that Uruguay's borders were marked "by the line of the lowest River Plate tides," that is, the dry coast. We must admit, however, that such an astounding opinion never spread. This fact was confirmed with the signing of the Ramirez-Saenz Pena Protocol in January 1910. During the following decades the two countries advanced gradually and methodically, overcoming more than one political storm, toward the creation of a juridical framework for resolving pending issues constructively. The result of these efforts was the River Plate and Maritime Front Treaty signed by Argentina and Uruguay in November 1973. It can be said that the agreement was the result of particularly favorable circumstances, but it is also true that it represented the final stage of a long and historic process of convergence. The treaty's prologue establishes that the document's main purpose is to iron out difficulties derived from "all situations lacking juridical definition on the exercise of equal rights on the River Plate." The treaty still is criticized in both countries. Those who criticize it are increasingly fewer, however. But no one can deny that the treaty established a solid framework of principles, norms, and institutions (bilateral commissions) that have contributed to the integral use of this vast and shared river and maritime area. There is no doubt, then, that what was agreed on by both parties in the River Plate Administrating Commission on the dredging of the Martin Garcia channel, and the upcoming meeting of Presidents Carlos Menem and Luis Alberto Lacalle to officially present the documents on conditions for bidding on the channel dredging, have a major historic, economic, and political importance. The work that will be implemented jointly by Argentina and Uruguay is not only part of one of the biggest binational projects that will be undertaken within the treaty's framework. The work also will represent a large contribution by both River Plate countries to the vast River Plate basin's development. The future of Mercosur and the Paraguay-Parana Waterway (Puerto Caceres-Nueva Palmira) depend to a good extent on free and cheap access for maritime transport services required to link producers with their trade partners abroad. The key to the river system has always been, and will continue to be, the River Plate's navigation channels. The work also will contribute to the development of Argentine and Uruguayan ports on the Uruguay River, which are not part of the Paraguay-Parana waterway but also have great development possibilities. The Martin Garcia channel's dredging is a job that will benefit all river system users located upriver. Uruguay is only one of them and not precisely the most important user. It also will complement other projects now in the process of implementation. The channel dredging agreement signed between Argentina and Uruguay represents a victory for common sense and the spirit of cooperation. The two River Plate countries' governments have constructively overcome difficult obstacles and agreed in advance to a shared undertaking that will benefit their peoples in addition to all the other people living in the River Plate basin.
