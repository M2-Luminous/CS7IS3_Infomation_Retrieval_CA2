In an interview with Interfax he welcomed the positive reaction by the conflicting sides to the mediatory role of Russia which provides a ceasefire in the zone of the Karabakh conflict on March 1 in line with the four-partite agreement. Oganesyan believes that Russia's mediation goes in line with the CSCE efforts. He said that the main thing today is to achieve a lasting ceasefire, to withdraw the armed units of the conflicting sides. The spokesman said that the mechanism to provide security for the population of Nagorno Karabakh and the non-resumption of the hostilities will be worked out during further talks. Oganesyan expressed hope that the initiative will establish a long-awaited peace in the region. A spokesman for the defence army of Nagorno Karabakh has told Interfax that, contrary to the ceasefire agreement, Azeri troops fired at Karabakh positions Tuesday. Obeying the command's order on ceasefire, Karabakh troops did not retaliate.
