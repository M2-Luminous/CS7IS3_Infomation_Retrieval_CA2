FR940524-0-00034 FR940524-0-00008 3. The Commission initially did not require local telephone companies other than the BOCs to comply with ONA requirements and nondiscrimination safeguards. The Commission stated that it would revisit the issue of applying these requirements to GTE once initial ONA implementation by the BOCs was completed. After gaining substantial experience with the BOCs, on December 2, 1992, the Commission released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to seek comment on its proposal to apply to GTE the ONA requirements and nondiscrimination safeguards that govern the BOCs' participation in the enhanced services market (57 FR 62544, Dec. 21, 1992). 4. In the Report and Order adopted March 8, 1994 (FCC 94&hyph;58), the Commission decided that it should no longer exempt GTE from complying with ONA requirements and nondiscrimination safeguards. The Commission concluded that applying these measures to GTE will extend greater access to the largest non-BOC local telephone company, thus facilitating the provision of additional information age services and greater price competition to consumers. 5. GTE's primary argument against the imposition of these requirements appeared to be the implementation costs. The Commission, however, concluded that the benefits of applying these requirements to GTE substantially outweigh the costs involved based on GTE's estimated implementation costs. The Commission concluded that the implementation costs are not greatly affected by inclusion of GTE's more dispersed, rural service areas because, according to GTE, the costs of implementing ONA are primarily fixed costs related to modifying GTE's centralized systems. 6. In addition, the Commission concluded that GTE, by many measures, is one of the largest local telephone companies in the United States. When compared to the BOCs, GTE ranks second behind BellSouth in total operating revenue, total gross plant, and the number of employees. While GTE has many service areas that are smaller and more rural than those of the BOCs, it has more working loops than Southwestern Bell even if GTE study areas with less than 200,000 working loops are excluded. GTE also serves a number of major urban areas in Florida, California, Hawaii, and Texas, that resemble BOC service areas. The Commission concluded that consumers in GTE's large service areas would benefit substantially from an environment that fosters the competitive provision of enhanced services. 7. The Commission also concluded that GTE's voluntary ONA measures, while commendable, fall short of the BOC standards and cannot achieve the Commission's goals. Specifically, the Commission concluded that GTE's network disclosure and customer proprietary network information (CPNI) programs lack certain important elements contained in the BOC's requirements. Also, GTE's voluntary program does not include disclosure of important information that the BOCs must report. Thus, the Commission required GTE to implement BOC ONA requirements and comply with the BOC nondiscrimination safeguards. 8. Based on the experience gained in implementing ONA for the BOCs, the Commission was able to streamline this process for GTE. The Commission referred GTE to the numerous orders in the Computer III and ONA proceedings that provide detailed review and guidance on how it should implement ONA. The Commission required GTE to comply with the comparably efficient interconnection requirements and all other ONA requirements imposed in the Computer III and ONA proceedings. The Commission did not require that GTE detail these measures in the ONA plan it must submit to the Commission as long as GTE's ONA program follows specific procedures approved for the BOCs and is consistent with requirements set out in the ONA orders. If GTE wants to request authority to meet the requirements in a different way, it must justify the request in its ONA plan. 9. GTE is also required to participate in the Information Industry Liaison Committee (IILC) beginning thirty days after publication of this Order in the Federal Register . GTE also must report to the Commission on its progress on IILC activities as the BOCs are required to do. 10. GTE is required to demonstrate in its ONA plan that its proposed initial offering of ONA services will adequately meet the needs of enhanced service providers (ESPs) in its service areas. GTE also must comply with the ONA deployment projection reporting requirements applicable to the BOCs. This information must be filed with GTE's ONA plan nine months after release of this order. Thereafter, the deployment report must be filed annually with the other annual reports on July 31 of each year beginning July 31, 1996. GTE will also be subject to all of the annual and semi-annual ONA reporting requirements that are applicable to the BOCs, and the reports must be filed on July 31 of each year beginning July 31, 1996. In addition, GTE is required to begin providing the semi-annual tariff report that the BOCs are required to file. The Commission required GTE to begin providing this report to the Commission on September 30, 1995, and every six months thereafter. 11. The Commission also required GTE to comply with the nondiscrimination requirements that govern the BOCs' provision of enhanced services. These nondiscrimination safeguards consist of CPNI rules, network information disclosure rules, and nondiscrimination reporting requirements. The Commission stated that as a Tier 1 local exchange carrier, GTE is already fully subject to the cost accounting safeguards adopted in the BOC Safeguards Order. 12. The Commission required GTE to comply with the CPNI requirements established for the BOCs within fifteen months of the release of this Order. Since GTE may need additional time to implement password ID systems, the Commission allowed GTE two years from the release of this order to comply with the password ID requirements. GTE must describe in its ONA plan how it will meet the CPNI requirements and include the CPNI notification letter it proposes to send to its multiline business customers. 13. GTE is also required to comply with the Commission's Operations Support Systems (OSS) requirements within fifteen months from the release of this Order. The Commission also required GTE to comply with the network disclosure rules effective fifteen months from the release of this Order. GTE is not required to detail how it meets these requirements in its ONA plan as long as GTE's procedures follow specific procedures approved for the BOCs and are consistent with the Commission's requirements in a specific manner already approved for the BOCs.
