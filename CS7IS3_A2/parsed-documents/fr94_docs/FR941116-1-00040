FR941116-1-00040 FR941116-1-00009 (e) Any lender or holder in the medium-risk or high-risk categories, as described in ยง60.14, must submit a default management plan with its application to be a HEAL lender or holder. The default management plan must specify the detailed short-term and long-term procedures that the lender or holder will have in place to minimize defaults on loans to HEAL borrowers. Under the plan the lender or holder must, among other measures, assure that borrowers receive information concerning repayment options, deferments, forbearance, and the consequences of default. (f) A lender with a default rate that exceeds 20 percent (except for a lender with a total loan volume, for purposes of the default rate calculation, of 50 loans or less) is ineligible to make HEAL loans. A holder with a default rate that exceeds 20 percent (except for a holder with a total loan volume, for purposes of the default rate calculation, of 50 loans or less) is ineligible to purchase HEAL loans. 10. Section 60.33 is amended by redesignating paragraphs (g) and (h) as paragraphs (h) and (i), respectively; and by adding a new paragraph (g) to read as follows: ยง60.33 Making a HEAL loan. * * * * * (g) HEAL loans with cosigners. In determining whether a cosigner is creditworthy, a lender must follow procedures for determining creditworthiness that are at least as stringent as those it would follow in making commercial loans or private loans without a Federal guarantee. If a lender does not make commercial loans or private loan without a Federal guarantee, it must obtain and follow creditworthiness procedures that are used by a commercial lender who does make such loans. * * * * * 11. Section 60.35 is amended by revising the introductory paragraph, paragraphs (a)(1) and (2), and paragraphs (e) and (f) to read as follows: ยง60.35 HEAL loan collection. A lender or holder must exercise due diligence in the collection of a HEAL loan with respect to both a borrower and any endorser or cosigner. In collecting a loan with an endorser or cosigner, the lender or holder must apply to the endorser or cosigner collection procedures that are at least as stringent as those it would follow in attempting to collect a commercial or private loan with an endorser or cosigner. At a minimum, in order to exercise due diligence, a lender or holder must implement the following procedures when a borrower fails to honor his or her payment obligations: (a)(1) When a borrower is delinquent is making payment, the lender or holder must remind the borrower within 15 days of the date the payment was due by means of a written contact. If payments do not resume, the lender or holder must contact both the borrower and any endorser or cosigner at least 3 more times at regular intervals during the 120-day delinquent period following the first missed payment of that 120-day period. The second demand notice for a delinquent account must inform the borrower that the continued delinquent status of the account will be reported to consumer credit reporting agencies if payment is not made. Each of the required four contacts must consist of at least a written contact which has an address correction request on the envelope. The last contact must consist of a telephone contact, in addition to the required letter, unless the borrower and any endorser or cosigner cannot be contacted by telephone. The lender or holder may choose to substitute a personal contact for a telephone contact. A record must be made of each attempt to contact and each actual contact, and that record must be placed in the borrower's file. Each contact must become progressively firmer in tone. If the lender or holder is unable to locate the borrower and any endorser or cosigner at any time during the period when the borrower is delinquent, the lender or holder must initiate the skip-tracing procedures described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. (2) If the lender or holder is unable to locate either the borrower or any endorser or cosigner at any time, the lender or holder must initiate and use skip-tracing activities which are at least as extensive and effective as those it uses to locate borrowers delinquent in the repayment of its other loans of comparable dollar value. To determine the correct address of the borrower and any endorser or cosigner, these skip-tracing procedures should include, but need not be limited to, contacting any other individual named on the borrower's HEAL application or promissory note (or the endorser or cosigner's application), using such sources as telephone directories, city directories, postmasters, drivers license records in State and local government agencies, records of members of professional associations, consumer credit reporting agencies, skip locator services, and records at any school attended by the borrower. All skip-tracing activities used must be documented. This documentation must consist of a written record of the action taken and its date and must be presented to the Secretary when requesting preclaim assistance or when filing a default claim for HEAL insurance.
