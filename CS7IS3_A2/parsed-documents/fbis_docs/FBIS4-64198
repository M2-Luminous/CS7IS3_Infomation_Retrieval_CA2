According to an interim report, during the first six months Siemens achieved a yield after taxes of 879 million German marks [DM] (previous year DM877 million). A spokesman for the corporation said, however, upon inquiry, that Siemens still expects a declining annual profit for the 1993-94 business year. During the latest shareholders' meeting Financial Director Karl-Hermann Baumann announced a probably constant operational pretax profit (previous year DM1.055 billion) and a lower financial yield before taxes (previous year DM1.855 billion). The fact that this development of profits has not yet had an effect in the course of this year was justified by the spokesman by good financial results during the first quarter of the business year. As the interim report further shows, foreign business has particularly revived for Siemens. Orders received rose by 8.6 percent to DM44.4 billion during the period under review compared with the same period last year. Orders received from aboard even rose by 21 percent to DM26.9 billion, while domestic demand declined by 6.4 percent to DM17.5 billion. As one reason for the increase in foreign orders, Siemens cites the first consolidation of the U.S. lamp producer Osram Sylvania, but also a strong foreign demand for products of drive, switching, and wiring technology, automobile technology, medical technology, private communications technology, as well as facilities for energy production. Weak domestic demand primarily affected installation and automatization technology, public communication networks, as well as the transfer and distribution of energy. Turnover also developed more favorably for the corporation abroad. During the period under review, overall turnover rose by 3 percent to DM38 billion, with turnover abroad going up 13 percent to DM22.4 billion, while domestic turnover declined by 9.3 percent to DM15.6 billion. However, Siemens points out that, without including Osram Sylvania, corporation turnover would have remained constant. Siemens says that business with modular units and transportation technology are the "supporters of growth." Even though Siemens Nixdorf Information Systems increased turnover abroad, it has not compensated for the weak domestic business with that. In the development of personnel, a clear shift across borders can be seen. At the end of March 397,000 people were employed, which is about 6,000 more than a year ago. The inclusion of new corporation companies for the first time, above all Osram Sylvania, with 14,000 employees, however, disguises the simultaneous personnel reduction of 8,000 people. The number of employees in Germany was reduced by 5,000 to 233,000, while staff abroad increased by 11,000 to 164,000. In conclusion, Siemens reports on a decline of investment during the period under review to DM2.4 (3.5) billion, which is mainly due to lower purchases of shares. According to unconfirmed reports, Siemens transferred about DM1.36 billion for Sylvania to the U.S. GTE Corporation during the period under review.
