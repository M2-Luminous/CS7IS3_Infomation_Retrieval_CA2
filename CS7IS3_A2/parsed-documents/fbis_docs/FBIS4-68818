Palchikov: "Cold Climate for Business"] [Text] Tatarsk--V. Naumovets, general director of a construction association, came to the newspaper's local bureau. I have known Viktor Sergeyevich for a long time: He is a crafty, competent manager. He has extensive ties not only with Russian businessmen but also with near abroad countries. On my desk is a letter to Naumovets signed by Turkmenistan's Minister of Education R. Karayev: "The ministry deeply appreciates your association's help and your personal participation in the production and delivery of technical teaching aids, school furniture, and other equipment for general education schools and other organizations in Turkmenistan." Viktor Sergeyevich himself says enthusiastically on the subject: "What is bad about us attracting foreign investment, creating jobs, and paying taxes into the rayon budget?" Nothing; actually, it is all very good. But why is the businessman in a depressed mood; who has hurt him? "Hurt" probably sounds a little innocent: Who can hurt a person who is economically free, who, as they used to say in classic Russian literature, moves millions? In this case the offending party is the rayon tax inspectorate headed by G. Martyntsova. By the way, a competent specialist and an extremely charming woman. "There are driving us crazy with audits," says Viktor Sergeyevich. "They audit the same things five, 10 times." A lively correspondence ensued between the "adversaries." Here is what Galina Vladimirovna writes to Viktor Sergeyevich: "Dear general director! Point 3 of your statement that the taxpayer Tatarskseluchprofstroy cannot fulfill its obligations and pay taxes for 1993 sounds incomprehensible and absurd." Viktor Sergeyevich responds to Galina Vladimirovna: "Dear Counselor 2d rank of the tax service! I am very grateful for your sincere and speedy reply to my letter. You permitted yourself a remark that the phrase regarding the impossibility of paying taxes for 1993 'sounds incomprehensible and absurd.' You did not read my letter attentively; Captain Nazarenko did not just "violate the form"--he impounded 100 percent of the documentation, including the balance sheet with attachments which you, Counselor 2d rank, kindly mentioned..." This kind of politely cool fencing. As you may have figured out, the issue is simple: taxes. One side demands them; the other believes that it does not have to pay. There have already been appeals to the arbitration court, which made a ruling in favor of the association. A second hearing will be held soon. The tax inspectorate has learned from previous mistakes and is better prepared. It is hard to say in whose favor the ruling will be. Both interlocutors are deeply convinced that they are right. Let us listen to entrepreneurs: In addition to Naumovets, another participant in the conversation is V. Katernikov, chairman of Svyaz Joint-Stock Company and a store owner--he also has problems with the tax inspectorate, only this time the city one. He also won a ruling in his favor in the arbitration court and believes that entrepreneurs are being deliberately hounded--but without them neither the city, nor the rayon, nor the country will get on their feet. An increasingly greater share of revenue comes in the form of taxes from business; as to enterprises and organizations, life is dying there, while unemployment is growing. And the number of budget-financed organizations is growing. Over the past few years alone about 10 new ones were added in Tatarsk: two tax inspectorates, tax police, federal treasury, employment center, pension fund, and so on. Until recently Tatarsk had about 15 cooperatives--construction materials manufacture, leather-, garment-making, and others. They have been crushed by all sorts of arbitration and taxes. Now there are no cooperatives, except those in trade, whose number keeps growing. Where would additional revenue for the budget come from if everybody consumes but nobody makes anything? Galina Vladimirovna has a point, too, however: "We do not want anything beyond what is due. All we want is to collect taxes; this is what the service has been set up for. If businessmen engage in tax evasion, what are we to do? It is not we who make life hard for the association--they have dragged us from one court to another." The reader has probably noticed the entrance of a new actor in our story--Militia Captain Nazarenko, who the general director mentioned. He was the person who impounded the documents for the audit. In turn, Naumovets filed a claim with the Tatarsk People's Court. It is said that the shadow of the recent elections hangs over this whole incident. The association actively helped its candidate to the oblast soviet and was stunningly successful in it. Heads of city and rayon administrations suffered a crushing defeat, after which the incident with the documents allegedly took place. Most likely this is a coincidence, an accidental occurrence, but the fact that the recently emerged structures, needed by the rayon and the country, cannot take root is very alarming.
