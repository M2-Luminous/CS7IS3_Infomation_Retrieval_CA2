Three people, two of whom were young children, were shot dead in the Bhambayi squatter camp near Durban yesterday, and several shacks were set alight. In Empangeni several people were injured in attacks on people returning from the march, and in Stanger an ANC supporter was stabbed after a march. The ANC has blamed the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] for the violence. Meanwhile, the IFP has dismissed as a failure yesterday's ANC march through the Durban city center. The IFP accused the ANC of busing in Xhosas from the Transkei and the Eastern Cape, and said many of the protesters had been too young to vote. The ANC said the rally proved that tens of thousands of Zulus supported participation in the election.
