The American secretary of state, Warren Christopher, was in Paris today. Stephane Manier reports: [Manier] Warren Christopher was not expecting this. He was not expecting the French to bring up for discussion the Bosnian issue with so much insistence, including with President Mitterrand this evening. It was also the case one hour earlier with Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. The French repeated what Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said this morning. [Begin Juppe recording] However precious humanitarian aid may be, it is not sufficient to settle the problem, of course. A political settlement is the only way out. [end recording] It is obvious that the French did not want the Americans to say only that they were ready to bomb Serbian artillery at any time, but that they would become involved on the ground. However, the Americans have not changed their position since the NATO summit in Brussels. [Begin Christopher recording in English with superimposed French translation] The United States is not ready to have ground troops in Bosnia to impose a solution in this conflict. [end recording] So the Americans have appeared really annoyed by the French insistence, and Christopher's entourage speculated this evening: aren't the French trying to make us take the blame for their future withdrawal next spring? It is indeed difficult for the Western side to speak with one voice. As for him, Warren Christopher preferred to get into his limousine quickly.
