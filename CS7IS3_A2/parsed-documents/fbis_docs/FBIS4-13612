Now calling themselves Dalits -- the Oppressed -- the leaders of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), which was swept to power in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh last year, have denounced Gandhi as "the biggest enemy of Dalits". The upper castes who dominate the media, the bureaucracy and the armed forces have reacted with outrage. But conscious of the new-found voting power of the Dalits, India's Brahmin prime minister, P. V. Narasimha Rao, went to Bombay yesterday to unveil a statue of their hero, the late Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar. "Ambedkar carried out the daunting task of demanding rights for the lowest people, but the still more daunting task of implementing his ideals remains," Mr Rao said. "Only when caste discrimination stops and political parties stop getting mileage out of these divisions can we say his dream has come true." Mr Rao was not the only one to cash in on the 103rd anniversary of the birth of Ambedkar, the Untouchable who beat the system by going to the United States and Britain, becoming a brilliant lawyer and drafting India's constitution. The leaders of many states and political parties attended public meetings, to be seen garlanding his statues or unveiling new ones. The day emphasised what last November's elections had shown -- that Dalits are at last demanding their rights. Gandhi, whose trader caste is a sub-group of Vaishnya, third on the overall scale, grew up as an orthodox Hindu, although he opposed the denigration of Untouchables. For much of his life he believed in caste as an orderly system of doing one's duty and "following one's father's calling" which would protect India from the greed and venality of the West. But as a result of his long dispute with Ambedkar, he gradually accepted that the rigid caste system was unjust, and he even advocated inter-caste marriage. To modern Dalit leaders this change was too little and too late. "Our society is still dominated by upper castes who are chelas (disciples) of Gandhi" said Ms Mayawati, deputy leader of the BSP. "These people treat Gandhi as their god. I don't." She accused him of "gestures smacking of tokenism" when he helped Untouchables to clean latrines and shared meals with them -- practices which caste Hindus regard as intolerably polluting. "There is a new awakening among the Dalit masses who realise that they were misled all these years," she declared. "This awakening is bound to result in them becoming more assertive in demanding their rights. If they don't get them, they'll fight." The veteran socialist historian, sociologist and one-time MP Madhu Limaye said the BSP was making a serious blunder. The Dalits' situation was still bad, although, with reserved positions for them in parliament, the bureaucracy and the forces, "it is much better than in my youth". "Mayawati and others are causing great harm to the Dalits because they'll lose the sympathy of millions of Dalits who respect Gandhi," he said. While Gandhi has certainly been idolised in the past, even by many Dalits, the independent country he forged has done little for the overwhelming majority of Dalits. The BSP is the engine of their impatience, but whether it can be the vehicle that will solve their problems, is another matter. Mr Limaye thinks not. He accused the BSP leader, Kanshi Ram, of dismissing questions about his economic policies by saying: "Just give us power, the rest will follow." "A party with no policy for production and creating jobs has no future," Mr Limaye declared. "It may not last for more than three years."
