He is almost 10 minutes late for the breakfast appointment. His program is rushed, the night was a bit short. Juri Luik has been foreign minister of Estonia since the beginning of this year. Together with his colleagues from the two other Baltic states, Latvia and Lithuania, he was recently invited to Bonn by Federal Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. That this invitation was gladly accepted is obvious. A visit to Germany is for Luik more than mere diplomatic routine, for he believes that in the Bonn government he will find especially committed support in the solution of the multifaceted political problems of his still young independent country. Luik's homeland needs intercessors above all vis-a-vis Moscow. In Estonia, which became independent in 1991, now as before Russian troops are stationed--the legacy of the Soviet past. And in Tallinn people rightly fear that they will not have been completely withdrawn by August 31 as originally agreed. At any rate, this is at present the biggest political problem for Estonia's government. And thus for the young foreign minister as well. Juri Luik is just 27 years old. At first glance, his full beard can easily be deceptive in this regard. He is among the guard of young politicians who today steer the political destinies of the most northern of the three Baltic states. His prime minister, Mart Laar, is just 34 years old, in the entire government team no one is over 40 years old. Only Lennart Meri, the state president enthroned above them, is among the seniors. On March 29 he celebrated his 65th birthday. In spite of his youthfulness, Luik, who was born on August 17, 1966, in Estonia's capital Tallinn, already has a notable career to his credit. After studying journalism at the University of Tartu, he worked beginning in 1989 initially as a political editor at the cultural weekly VIKERKAAR, to change from there as an expert for Anglo-Saxon studies at the renowned Estonia Institute. As director of the political department of the Foreign Ministry, Luik, who speaks splendid English and, of course, Russian and Finnish as well, in 1991, the year of independence, moved into the political career. The stages were short: In September 1992, after the first free elections, he was elected deputy of the coalition party "Pro Patria" to parliament; a month later, as minister without portfolio, he then directed the delegation of his country in the delicate negotiations with Russia. In August 1993 he became minister of defense, and since January of this year has held the office of foreign minister. This evolution makes it clear that he regards the withdrawal of the Russian soldiers as the center and pivotal point of the current foreign policy of his country. This is all the more so because Moscow only at the beginning of March let it be known that Russia no longer feels bound to the deadline of August 31 and will decide on the return as it sees fit. "This date, after all, was proposed by the Russians themselves," the foreign minister observes with irritation. Now one can only hope that they will keep to this date, he added with anything but confidence. For Juri Luik there is no doubt that the Russian hesitation tactic has its source exclusively in the will to demonstrate power. In his view, you see, the danger for his homeland does not emanate from a direct threat. "The Russians, after all, today have no more than about 2,500 active soldiers stationed in Estonia. Technically, they would, therefore, be in the position to order the return of such a limited contingent any day." But: "It is nothing but a political question. Russia wants to exert permanent pressure on the Baltic states." And in this delicate situation his country is betting on Europe, in particular on Germany. No, it does not have to be pressure that Bonn and the European Union [EU] should exert on Russia, the diplomat believes. However, gentle, but constant influence should be exerted. It should be made clear to the Russians again and again, he said, that they must observe their own obligations and bring their soldiers home by the agreed deadline. This type of support, he indicated, is "very, very important" for his country. But the minister from Tallinn cannot or will not conceal his scepticism completely. So he agrees completely with his president, who not long ago complained about the German appeasement policy towards Russia. "Yes," Luik says seriously, "that is so, at any rate to a certain degree." But immediately a slight correction follows: "If we are asked whether a German-Russian axis means a danger for us, we say first of all that we do not presume such an axis." Actually, he let it be known, people in Tallinn welcome the friendship between Bonn and Moscow. But, and now again unambiguously: "We do not want to be sacrificed for this friendship." The Estonians, too, if Luik had his way, would like to be friends of the Russians. In his view it looks quite as though the Russians themselves are interested in an integration in Europe. But for this, he pointed out, there are clear criteria after all. "In Europe there are certain rules of conduct, which must be accepted by all countries, large and small. And these norms also apply to the Russians." Of this they must be reminded again and again, and specifically in their own interest: Such admonitions, you see, would also mean a strengthening of the democratic forces in Russia. Luik, of course, knows the thesis that the political key to this does not at all lie in Europe, but rather in the United States, that there can indeed be an accord between Washington and Moscow in staking out their own spheres of interest anew. But in his view it should not terrify. He believes that especially the strong European states, like Germany, have an interest in there not being any new two-power policy: "Such a policy, after all, would be a swindle. After all, there is no longer a second superpower." But even if it would be so, he pointed out, the Europeans are certainly politically and economically strong enough to be able to prevent "a game over their heads." In any case, he does not believe that "the European Allies would allow Washington to do this." For him, the thesis of new spheres of interest is ultimately equivalent to the "sacrifice of border states." Moreover, for the diplomat, this would only be the first step: "History has taught us, after all, that a first sacrifice, as a rule, is followed by others." For him, this would be a genuine policy, for which he understandably sees "absolutely no reason." Luik is firmly convinced that the Western community holds all the cards vis-a-vis Russia, politically, economically, and psychologically. But: "It must only play its hand." That is to say: In an energetic policy vis-a-vis Russia. And here he again emphasizes the positive effect of such a policy for Russia: "We, too, after all, want people like Boris Yeltsin to be supported." At the latest here the inflammatory word Zhirinovsky must fall. Luik: "In the West there must be no inclination of any kind toward the view that (the right-wing radical) Zhirinovsky is something like a good boy, with whom one can perhaps make political deals." And: "Whoever appeases to that extent is a fool!" According to Luik, this is the basic line that one has to follow. What does a young Balt think when he hears from Moscow that all Russians must be protected, therefore also the Russian minority in Estonia? Luik corrects: "After all, Yeltsin said in a speech before the parliament that Russia will protect all Russians, whether they live in the near or the more remote area abroad." For the Estonian, such words are, on the one hand, "quite clear imperialist policy," but, on the other, he does not know precisely what in the final analysis they are supposed to mean: "Does Yeltsin mean by this also Russians who have emigrated to Israel? Are they also his compatriots?" For Luik, the answer to such questions is simply a test case for all of Western democracy. This is all the more so because Moscow links such claims propagandistically with the aspects of human rights and minority rights for the Russians in Estonia, who constitute close to a third of the approximately 1.6 million inhabitants. The foreign minister again takes up Yeltsin's speech before the parliament. To be sure, he talked about Russian interests, but not about how these interests could be pursued by democratic means, by the means of consensus, including with smaller neighboring countries. Luik: "This was completely missing in his speech." Luik further: "Yeltsin says that Russia belongs to Europe, that the Russians do not want to be guests." But for Luik, this, too, is not the point: "No one wants to keep Russia out of Europe. What we want is for Russia to follow the European norms." In Luik's words, those who argue that people want the Russians in Europe, even if its troops are still stationed in the Baltic states, are making a mistake: They ignore, after all, "the rules which those had in mind who formulated the fundamental values of the Council of Europe." That, in view of these grand political atmospherics, Estonia and the other two Baltic countries want to see their future in the EU and in NATO is an entirely logical consequence for Luik. With a view to the EU, he is quite realistic. As he sees it, the first priority here is to bring to completion the so-called Europe Agreement for association by the end of this year. Quite different, by contrast, his opinion about a close linkage to the Western defense alliance. The joining of his country, too, in the so-called "Partnership for Peace," which NATO at its summit meeting in January offered to the East European states as substitute for membership in the alliance, to be sure, he does not wish to be understood as resignation, but "of course, we are not satisfied with that, we want much more." Surely, he suggested, this concept is a sign that NATO is not indifferent to the security interests of the Balts. On the basis of the missing security guarantees in the concept, however, it is not known "what NATO will do if things become dangerous for us." Joint maneuvers in the Baltic Sea, he observed, are after all no guarantees. "Perhaps," so Estonia's foreign minister consoles, "this is even a helpful instability." For him it is certain in any case that the "Partnership for Peace" is an empty cover, which was accepted only because of its political significance. "Totally disappointed" is Juri Luik by the fact "that there is no awareness either in NATO or in other European organizations that time is running." In his view, there have already been excellent opportunities for the preparation of a firm inclusion in NATO and for a reorganization in Europe: "When Yegor Gaidar and Boris Fedorov governed in Russia, when Russia still conducted itself like a democratic country, this all would have been much simpler." Today it would have to be stated that "we have lost a lot of time to change Europe." The young minister from Tallinn evidently tries to ignore the question of why then especially the Americans in the matter of NATO membership of the Baltic states, too, show so much consideration for Moscow. "We have always told the Russians that it would be useful for them if the Baltic states were members of NATO." Then the mutual relations would be much more relaxed. If we felt secure, both sides could also quite easily reach compromises, including on border questions." But, in the words of Estonia's chief diplomat: "We do not feel secure."
