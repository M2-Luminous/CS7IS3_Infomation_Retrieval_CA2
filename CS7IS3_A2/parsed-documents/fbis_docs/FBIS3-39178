However, it is more difficult to decide on actual air strikes, says Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto. [Haavisto] In my opinion, the genocide that has been taking place around Sarajevo ought to be brought to an end somehow, and if this threat is able to end this genocide and as I have understood, at least the Serbs are saying that they will then move their heavy weapons from the surroundings of the city, then that aim has been achieved. [Juselius] In other words, Finland supports in principle this kind of policy? [Haavisto] Well, in my opinion there must at least be a threat of this kind because the European states must have some possibility of preventing genocide of this kind. [Juselius] So you are in practice supporting this threat? [Haavisto] I think the threat is justified, but an actual strike is considerably harder in practice because there are, after all, these UN troops and people doing humanitarian work there so it is far more difficult. [Juselius] So Finland will have to formulate its stance again in the event that arms are actually resorted to? [Haavisto] We will have to see what happens, but I already noted that this threat seems to be quite sufficient.
