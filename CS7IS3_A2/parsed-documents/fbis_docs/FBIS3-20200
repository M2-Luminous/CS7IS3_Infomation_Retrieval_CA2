Erbakan, in a news conference in Ankara today, said that according to results he received from his party's organization, PP is the winner of the elections. Under these circumstances, Erbakan noted, the parties that have shrunk should unite under the PP. Charging that the votes of the coalition government dropped from 48 to 33 percent, Erbakan asked for early elections as soon as possible. He proposed a True Path Party [TPP]-Motherland Party [ANAP]-Social Democratic Populist Party tripartite coalition until the early elections on a trial basis. According to information reaching him from provinces and districts, his party is leading both in the municipal council elections and the mayoral posts, Erbakan remarked, adding that from now on his party will mark 27 March as the holiday of local authorities. He said: [Begin recording] The most important number showing the strength of the parties is the votes for the provincial councils. These results are not final yet. The work is still continuing. Looking at the data so far, we see that the PP is leading with a big majority in the big cities, in the towns, in districts, and in townships. As far as the total provincial council election results are concerned, the three parties -- PP, ANAP, and TPP -- are competing with one another. Any one of them is leading in accordance with the vote counts. We have not yet received the final results. [end recording] [passage omitted]
