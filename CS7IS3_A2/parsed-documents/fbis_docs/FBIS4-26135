The sanctions also include such steps as a halt to economic and technical assistance to the DPRK and a halt to the $15 million in annual aid offered by the UN to the DPRK. Technical assistance to be stopped includes that for a program on the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy. In addition, diplomatic exchanges, as well as cultural, technical, scientific, commercial, and educational exchanges, with the DPRK will be reduced, and air transportation to the DPRK will also be stopped. The sanctions proposal was submitted to the UN Security Council yesterday. The proposed sanctions seem rather mild, because Chapter 7 of the UN Charter on the use of force by states to execute a UN resolution was not applied in this case. First, if force is not used to ensure the enforcement of the UN resolution, then arms can still be shipped freely to the DPRK. Second, as the sanctions bill will be put to the vote in the UN Security Council, China, as a permanent member of the Security Council, may exercise its veto as it has explicitly expressed its opposition to the sanctions. The United States may say that if the proposals are not adopted by the Security Council, the United States and its allies will continue to unilaterally impose the sanctions against DPRK, but the sanctions will become less effective. Third, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter is now visiting Pyongyang, the capital of the DPRK, and he advocates that the United States and the DPRK should establish full-scale diplomatic relations. The U.S. strategy is to combine threats with inducements in order to compel the DPRK to submit. The United States seems tough on the surface, but, fortunately, its real intention is to seek a peaceful solution. The announcement of the sanctions proposal appears to aggravate the tension, but the real situation is not that tense.
