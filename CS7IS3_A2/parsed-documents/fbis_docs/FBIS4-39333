Nedrigaylo, Ukrainian first deputy minister of internal affairs, unexpectedly made an appearance on Crimean television to explain that the Crimean MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] has finally been disbanded, transformed into a Main Directorate of Internal Affairs, and placed under the jurisdiction of the department in Kiev. But within an hour Vyacheslav Lebedev, the Crimean president's press secretary, and and Valeriy Kuznetsov, the autonomous formation's minister of internal affairs, appeared on television and stated that nothing of the kind had happened and that Mr. Nedrigaylo's speech was bogus and a piece of disinformation. Meanwhile, Ukrainian television described how in Lvov the leaders of the Ukrainian People's Self-Defense are busily turning some of their thugs into "active leisure groups," which will be sent to the Crimea. Since the Don cossacks have gone to the peninsula as "tourists," they say, we have found our own way of assembling forces to protect national interests. Since not one of the Supreme Council's three decrees on the suspension of the Crimean Supreme Council's decisions has been fulfilled, on Wednesday the Ukrainian parliament intends to discuss more effective measures to pressure the autonomous formation's power structures. Kiev cannot tear itself away from the idea of a unitary state that it proclaimed three years ago and cannot fully come to terms with the experience provided by relations between Russia and Tatarstan. Of course, Ukraine is far removed from the popular image of a land of jaunty gopaks and fruit dumplings. But since achieving statehood it has come to grief over what was not the greatest of all stumbling blocks and cannot restore equilibrium, confirming yet again the shortsightedness of the present politicians and the weakness of the idea of nationalism as a state doctrine. This also explains the Ukrainian parliament's indecisive hesitation over one thing, namely, the dangerous choice of which direction to take; either to push Kravchuk into introducing direct presidential rule in the Crimea, or to declare a state of emergency there and disband the local Supreme Council, or to abolish the autonomous formation completely. Any of these decisions will be a call to action for both the Lvov "active leisure groups" and the Don cossacks. God knows what will happen then. Incidentally, there has been a considerable increase recently in the number of people at prayer in the Republic's Orthodox churches....
