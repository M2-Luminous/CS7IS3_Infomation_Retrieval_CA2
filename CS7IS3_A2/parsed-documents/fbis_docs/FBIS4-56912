Through an interpreter, he stressed that Costa Rica will continue its efforts to help the ROC gain deserving status in the international community. He also pointed out that it is appropriate for the ROC to join the UN and that at every occasion Costa Rica will support the ROC, which firmly defends democracy and has traditional ties of friendship with Costa Rica. [Begin Figueres recording] We will always stand on the side of the ROC and continue to fight for the ROC when necessary, so that the ROC will gain deserving status in the international community. We will not only continue our support for our traditional friend, but also render support, at every international occasion, to a country that defends democracy consistently. [end recording] President Jose Maria Figueres also expressed his wish to visit the ROC after he is sworn in and state affairs are in order, so as to draw on the ROC's experiences in every field. President Li Teng-hui expressed heartfelt thanks for the promise by the new Costa Rican Government. Besides, he stressed, as a sovereign state, the ROC is currently practicing pragmatic diplomacy and promoting cross-strait relations. There is no controversy in doing these simultaneously. He hoped the two sides of the strait would achieve mutual understanding. There is nothing inappropriate in the ROC trying to find a way to practice diplomacy and join the UN. [Begin President Li recording] It is very important for the two sides to foster mutual understanding. The ROC, however, needs to find a way to practice diplomacy as a sovereign state. In my opinion, these activities should proceed simultaneously. Since the ROC meets the requirement that a UN member state be peace-loving, it is very appropriate for the ROC to join the UN. [end recording] When answering a question at the news conference about solving the issue of Costa Rica's agricultural development, President Li Teng-hui, an agricultural expert, modestly said that President Jose Maria Figueres, a former agricultural minister, knows more about agriculture than he and surely has concrete plans. Li said the ROC Government and the private sector will help him fulfill these plans.
