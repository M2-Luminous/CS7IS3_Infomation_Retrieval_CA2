From their strongholds in Veliki (Radic), and Grabez, the chetniks have been shelling parts of this UN protected zone with howitzers and mortars, and trying to conceal this behind the [words indistinct] conflict caused by Abdic's traitor clique. Dozens of shells were fired overnight at the outskirts of Bihac, while the defense lines on the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau, Hasin Vrh, and Grabez have been under continuous mortar fire. In decisive counterattacks, the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 5th Corps has recaptured some of the territory on the plateau, inflicting heavy losses on the chetniks in manpower, and capturing a large amount of ammunition and equipment. This must have been the reason for the start of the chetniks' bestial shelling of civilian targets, which also served as a sign to the Kladusa traitor paramilitaries to intensify their own attacks on the areas of [word indistinct], Pecigrad, (Liskovac), and Todorovo.
