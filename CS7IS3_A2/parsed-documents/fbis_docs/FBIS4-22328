FBIS4-22328 "jpusr035___94033" FBIS-USR-94-035 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 7 April 1994 RUSSIA ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS Survey Shows Industrial Production Decline in 1993 Survey Shows Industrial Production Decline in 1993 944E0632A Moscow DELOVOY MIR in Russian No 53, 14-20 Mar 94 p 12 944E0632A Moscow DELOVOY MIR Russian CSO [Article by Vladislav Belyanov, candidate of economic sciences: "A Decline Without Signs of an Upswing: What Monthly Surveys of Industrial Enterprise Leaders Showed in 1993" [Text] DELOVOY MIR regularly acquaints its readers with the results of the monthly surveys of industrial enterprise directors, which the editors of the independent ROSSIYSKIY EKONOMICHESKIY BAROMETR bulletin have conducted since December 1991. This publication is now offering the aggregate results of these surveys during 1993. The editors accumulated the material from two years of statistical samplings. Readers, who are interested in the dynamics of the data obtained, can go to the final publication of the data for 1992 (DELOVOY MIR dated 25 March 1993) and the 1993 quarters (DELOVOY MIR dated 28 August 1993 and 11 January 1994). We would remind you that the respondents are approximately 150 industrial enterprise directors from various regions of Russia. The enterprises are mid-size (the number of workers is 800-1200 people) and the percentage of state ones among them decreased from 50 percent to 25 percent during 1993. They operate basically in the domestic market. Speaking briefly, they are typical Russian enterprises devoid of monopoly benefits which found themselves one by one in the market. One should emphasize the reliability and high accuracy of the directors' evaluations. A good knowledge of actual economic practices, competence and responsibility for their judgments are displayed in the appraisals. Let us compare the directors' appraisals of management results in 1993 with their forecasts of the expected results for last year and the first six months of 1994 (see Table 1). Table 1. Some Final Indicators for 1993 and the Forecast for the First Half of 1994 (%) June 1993 as a December 1993 as a Forecasts Made in January percentage of percentage of June 1994 December 1992 1993 Forecast Actual Forecast Actual March 1994 June 1994 made in made in as a as a January July 1993 percentage percentage 1993 of December of December 1993 1993 1.

Financial condition of the enterprise was (actual; percent of those replying): a) Good - 1 - 0 - - b) Normal - 39 - 21 - - c) Poor - 59 - 79 - - First of all, let us point out that the data is convincing evidence of the high accuracy in the directors' forecasts. Differing somewhat from the actual results (this is completely normal), these forecasts reliably reflect general development trends. On the whole, these appraisals are not noted for optimism although they contain details of no small importance, which deserve attention. There is, perhaps, only one noticeable deviation from the indicators in official statistics. The directors' appraisals of the actual volume of products, work and services practically do not state their decline (as it follows from the State Committee for Statistics data) but rather reveal a marking time. A previous survey made the assumption that this is explained by the specific nature of the responding enterprises: Being mid-size, they display greater stability than large and small firms. Spot conversations with the enterprise directors apparently confirm our version. Other indicators correspond to the description of the situation as a typically crisis one. The number of workers is frozen or is being reduced. A general increase in prices, in whose structure purchase prices are outstripping sales prices, is continuing. The financial condition of the enterprises is worsening. The labor costs (wages) are lagging behind price increases in their growth. A certain slowdown in the growth rate of prices (and this means of inflation also) is reassuring to some degree: During the second half of 1993, these rates decreased and, during the first half of 1994, the directors expect a further, although small, slowdown in price increases. It is also impossible not to see that the percentage of those, who expect a worsening of the financial situation in their enterprises by the middle of 1994, has decreased 1.5-fold. However, the situation with investments, which are rapidly being reduced, is extinguishing this weak spark of hope. In such a case, where can one expect an upswing if there is no growth in capital investments and no modernization of the production system? According to the survey data, the actual volume of capital investments in June 1993 was 61 percent of the December 1992 level and in December 1993 it was 52 percent of the June 1993 level. The directors expect that it will equal 41 percent of the December 1993 level in June 1994. These data correspond to the long-term estimates of demand for production capacities and manpower (see Table 2). Table 2. Availability of Production Capacities and Complete Manpower Staffing Relative to the Demand for Enterprise Products, Expected in the Next 12 Months (as a percentage of those surveyed) Possible answers When answer obtained June 1993 September 1993 December 1993 A. Availability of production capacities: 1. Surplus 21 32 38 2. Normal 55 40 47 3. Insufficient 25 28 15 B. Complete manpower staffing: 1. Surplus 16 29 32 2. Normal 57 49 56 3. Insufficient 26 22 22 As we see, the percentage of those enterprises, which possess surplus material and labor resources, increased during 1993 and the percentage of those enterprises, which experienced a shortage of them, decreased. A conclusion about the non-typical nature of the Russian crisis suggests itself. The fact is that the prolonged slump (despite a certain slowdown in it) is not displaying the beginnings of an upswing. The directors steadily predict that approximately another five years are required before the crisis ends. This is very similar to the fact that an upswing is generally not expected on the Russian economy's present path. It is simply slipping down to another, narrower and primitive, level of development -- to another, narrower, orbit of economic life from which, as the historical experience of developing countries confirms, it is practically impossible to set off for the heights of civilization. The Tenacious Noose of the Financial Crisis Table 3 reflects the answers to the question on the causes hindering production growth. It was proposed that the respondents name 3 of the 12 possible types of reasons. Table 3. During the Last Six Months, What Has Primarily Hampered Production in the Enterprise (as a percentage of those answering) Possible reasons When answer obtained January April July October January 1993 1993 1993 1993 1994 1.

Shortage of 2 5 7 6 0 equipment,production capacities, premises 12. Low worker skills 3 - - - - 13. Other reasons 8 7 3 6 7 The answers received do not contain any justification for other interpretations: The crisis in the financial area and the sales crisis connected with it hindered production during all of 1993. Let us point out that, among the financial reasons reining in the economy's normal functioning, it is not strictly market factors but an administrative smothering of growth that is showing through more and more clearly. Indeed, whereas the impact of the price factor (59 percent of those answering in January 1993) occupied first place at the beginning of 1993, this factor moved to second place in the middle of the year despite the continuing increase in prices, yielding first place to the shortage of financial assets in the enterprises. It had moved to third place by the end of the year, having been passed by high taxes. Moreover, the impact of the two leading factors (in the opinion of 65 percent of those responding) was so strong by the end of 1993 that it began to restrain the role of the price factor (it decreased to 52 percent). This aggravated the sales problem and made the effect of the resource factors (equipment, manpower, raw materials, etc.) as well as that of management and the privatization process practically insignificant. Thus, from the middle of 1993, the centralized establishment of high prices and refinancing rates became the main reason slowing down economic growth, especially investment dynamics. An unpleasant fact like the intensification of the trend toward in-kind exchange, was also detected (especially during the second half of 1993). The percentage of barter deals in the enterprises' turnover grew during the second half of the year from 9 to 11 percent. The proportion of enterprises marked by an increase in this percentage rose from 18 to 34 percent. There is a basis for assuming that these data are objectively underestimated even if only because mutual deliveries in accordance with clearing agreements are normally not stated as an in-kind exchange. I will repeat the conclusion contained in the previous survey: The primarily monetarist approach to stimulating the market is beginning to kill the market itself. In this situation, one cannot exclude an alternative where the growing uncontrolled nature of the economy will make a shift to strictly centralized regulation inevitable. Stress on Stimulating Production Table 4 sums up the directors' appraisals of ways to adapt to the management conditions that have taken shape and, consequently, of ways to get out of the crisis (here, it was also necessary to select 3 of the 12 suggested answers). Table 4. What Enterprises Primarily Need To Adapt More Quickly to the Conditions That Have Taken Shape (as a percentage of those answering) Possible When answer obtained answers December February May August November 1992 1993 1993 1993 1993 1. Obtain 61 60 50 55 58 money from product buyers 2. Look for 52 46 54 49 55 new sales markets 3. Pay off 35 24 33 35 34 debts to suppliers 4. Change the 32 36 32 28 32 composition of products produced 5. Pay off 20 17 29 21 24 debts to banks 6. Make 11 13 10 16 15 adjustments in enterprise leadership 7. Find 16 29 22 15 15 suppliers of raw materials and materials 8. Expand 16 13 12 22 14 production capacities 9. Reduce the 7 5 8 8 10 number of workers 10. Privatize 15 19 15 7 4 11. Other 2 6 4 3 6 12. Everything 0 3 1 2 1 is normal In this table, the concentration of factors is less rigid than in Table 2; however, we see even here the priority of the money factor -- primarily, nonpayments by buyers and the difficulties in repaying loans to suppliers and banks. At the end of the year, a strengthening in the requirements of commodity markets appeared: The percentage of respondents, who mentioned finding new sales markets and changing the composition of produced products as the leading ways to adapt to actual conditions, grew somewhat. At the same time, the problems in finding raw material suppliers slackened off. Unfortunately, these changes hardly signal a sudden change in the economy's dynamics. Rather, the present sales problems connected with the search for solvent buyers is having an effect here. It is regrettable that the problems in the production area are still being moved to one of the last places: In November 1993, only 14 percent of those surveyed saw the way out of the situation to be the expansion of production capabilities. This indicator had significantly decreased in comparison with August when it was 22 percent. The actual economic situation is not disposed to expanding production. Only one percent of the respondents said: "Everything is normal." These same people, when they were asked: "In your opinion, what is most important now for the Russian economy?" replied almost unanimously: "Stimulating production" (see Table 5). Table 5. In Your View What Is Most Important Now for the Russian Economy? (as a percentage of the number answering) Possible answers When answer obtained October 1993 November 1993 1. Stimulating production 66 73 2. Slowing inflation 27 18 3. Difficult to say 7 9 The following generalization suggests itself. The answers contained in Table 4 show short-term and tactical estimates of ways for enterprises to get out of the serious condition in which the crisis and volitional variants of the economic reforms have placed them. The data in Table 5 state the long-term and strategic plans of true experts on economic activity, whose confidence in the priority of a concern for stimulating production is rapidly growing: In October 1993, 66 percent of the respondents thought this and, after only a month, in November -- 73 percent. Of course, they are not supporters of an inflationary element. They simply do not believe in the miracle-working nature of monopolizing the manipulation of monetary levers. The Main Danger Is the Destruction of the Production System Alarming phenomena in the area of production characterized last year. An increase in the irreversible processes destroying the production system became more and more evident. The prolonged decline is holding out fewer and fewer chances for the system's rapid rebirth in an ultra-modern form. An absolute decrease in production capacities occurred during the entire year: In December 1993, their volume was 10 percent less than in December 1992. Approximately seven percent of the existing capacities will never be used in the opinion of the respondents. Those who answered listed another 15 percent of operating production capacities with those incurring losses during the second half of 1993. This means that they are candidates for retirement. Even the remaining, more effective, labor weapons are functioning in a weakened condition. According to the data of the monthly surveys, the workload level of production capacities was within the 70-75 percent range of the level which the directors estimated as normal. This indicator decreased to 69 percent in December from 76 percent in January-February and 78 percent in March. The percentage of enterprises, where the workload level of production capacities increased, varied little by quarter: 8-13 percent in the first quarter, 9-14 percent in the second, 6-13 percent in the third, and 7-9 percent in the fourth. The percentage of enterprises, where this indicator decreased, grew from 25-31 percent in the first quarter to 38-52 percent in the fourth. However, the trouble lies not only and not so much in such crisis phenomena. It is known that obsolete and inefficient equipment, technologies, etc., should disappear naturally during an economic decline, yielding their place to new and efficient ones. However, the trouble is that the old ones are growing old and new ones are not being born. The Paralysis in Investments Is Robbing the Future In comparison with the corresponding period of 1992, the directors estimated the total volume of capital investments during the first half of 1993 at 59 percent, and during the second half -- at 55 percent. They explain this by the following reasons (see Table 6 where it was necessary to select three of the suggested answers). Table 6. What Primarily Hindered Capital Investments in the Enterprise (as a percentage of those replying) Possible When answer obtained answers January March June September December 1993 1993 1993 1993 1993 1.

Low ruble 6 2 - - - exchange rate 14. Other 6 8 3 8 6 reasons As is evident from the data cited in the table, the financial crisis has fettered the dynamics of capital investment. Again, we observe how the paralyzing grasp of administrative monetarist measures has grown from month to month. The pressure of bank interest rates has increased literally by fits and starts: In January 1993, only 16 percent of the respondents saw in it a barrier on the investment path but, in December, they were 42 percent of all those completing the questionnaire. Before the fourth quarter, the effect of such a market factor as high prices for equipment, construction, etc., dominated. However, the shortage of ruble assets was literally treading on its heels. It won: The answers received in December 1993 put the primacy of the monetary famine into the minutes. Undoubtedly, this is the result of the present tax and credit policy. If one adds to this the pressure of existing debts (75 percent of the enterprises' nonpayments are explained by their lack of assets; the enterprises' debt to banks grew by 64 percent during the second half of 1993), we receive practically a complete set of the main barriers to growth. All of them are related to the monetary area (excluding hard currency relations, about which many spoke but which do not play a substantial role in the national economic mechanism but which are parasitic on it, diverting financial resources to speculative mergers). The effect of the other reasons, including the fashionable privatization processes, are completely insignificant. The Making of the Economic Structure a Primitive One Is Intensifying Last year did not bring any positive changes in the structure of investments (see Table 7). Table 7. Some Indicators of the Structure of Enterprise Capital Investments During the Last Six Months (as a percent of total capital investments) When answer received January March June September December 1993 1993 1993 1993 1993 Capital investment financing structure: a)Enterprise 79 66 72 65 75 internal assets (profit, amortization) b) Attracted 15 42 19 28 25 assets (credits, assets from issuing stock shares, etc.) Relationship between production and nonproduction (social, cultural and everyday living establishments) capital investments: a) Production - 56 65 60 75 b) Nonproduction - 32 30 36 25 3. Model technological structure of production capital investments: a) Passive 43 42 46 54 46 elements (buildings, structures) b) Active 49 46 54 46 54 elements (machinery, equipment) 4. Reproductive structure of production capital investments: a) Expanding 25 30 32 33 33 production capacities b) Reimbursement 63 56 59 65 67 for retirement of equipment, modernization, repairs As is seen from the data in the table, only 25-33 percent of the capital investments went to expand production capacities, and all the rest -- to patching up the obsolete production system. The proportion of expenditures on the passive elements of production capital (42-54 percent) is high. The percentage of investments in nonproduction capital is declining (from 30 percent in the first half of 1993 to 25 percent in the second). This means that social problems are increasing in enterprises. The credit policy has hobbled the possibility for using attracted assets, whose percentage in the form of credits and income from the issuance of stock shares during the first half of the year was only 25 percent among the sources of capital investments. According to the monthly survey data, 47-57 percent of the enterprises, on the whole, did not make any equipment purchases. All of these are serious symptoms of a grave illness fraught with losing the capability for receptivity to advanced technology -- a reduction in the need to use new and the latest scientific and technical solutions. Economic Reforming The answers to the December questionnaire, which contained a number of questions included for the first time, yielded some new information. The absence of its dynamics still does not permit making any generalization; however, the information itself can be of definite interest. Among the enterprise respondents, 69 percent have already undergone the privatization process. The majority (55 percent) prefer its second version, 20 percent selected the first version, and only 2 percent -- the third; 23 percent were inclined to different versions. Among the holders of the sold shares, labor collectives (66 percent of those responding) are in first place; next come the local branches of the Federal Property Fund (38 percent), enterprise administrations (26 percent), investment funds (16 percent), other enterprises (15 percent), banks (3 percent), and other owners (12 percent). A total of 27 percent of the enterprise respondents hold shares of other enterprises, and 47 percent --shares of banks. General stockholder meetings have already taken place in half of the privatized enterprises (49 percent). The majority of privatized enterprise (55 percent) have formed councils of directors. Almost everywhere, their composition includes representatives of the administration (98 percent of the surveyed enterprises) and labor collectives (82 percent) as well as representatives of the Fund for Federal Property (75 percent), other enterprises (36 percent), banks holding shares of enterprises (18 percent), investment funds (16 percent) and other enterprise shareholders (32 percent). Dissatisfaction With the Government's Economic Policy In conclusion, we will cite the answers of enterprise directors, which describe their attitude toward the government's economic policy (see Table 8). Table 8. Attitude toward the government's economic policy (as a percent of those responding) Questions When answer received and possible answers June September December February May August November 1992 1992 1992 1993 1993 1993 1993 A.

On the 24 23 29 22 17 22 25 whole, no 5. No 15 26 17 26 17 30 19 C. What have been the results from implementing the government's economic policy for your enterprise relative to other Russian enterprises? 1. The - 47 44 51 46 42 46 enterprise has lost (or gained less than others) 2. The - 35 46 41 35 46 47 enterprise has held its own 3. The - 18 10 8 20 12 8 enterprise gained (or lost less than others) We have deliberately included in this table the results of all the replies that we have (these questions were on seven questionnaires during the last two years of sampling). This selection over a protracted period convinces us of the persistent constancy of the opinions characteristic of the director body. During the two years that the statistical survey has been conducted (these years embrace the entire period following the price liberalization), less than a tenth of the respondents declared their understanding of the government's economic policy. In the middle of 1992, they were eight percent, and at the end of 1993 -- only four percent. An even smaller part of the directors considered this policy correct: five percent in the middle of 1992 and only one percent at the end of 1993. Almost half of the respondents habitually state that they suffered losses from implementing this policy (in 1993, they ranged from 42 to 51 percent); in turn, those maintaining the opposite were significantly fewer (from 8 to 20 percent). We took the data of the entire period of the statistical survey because they are practically not connected with the change in the composition of the government and with the change in its leaders. Rather, an appraisal is given not of some former or current members or other of the government but of its policy itself. Of course, one cannot ignore the extensive criticism addressed to the director body, whose representatives are the respondents. However, we have no other production directors and they will not appear by magic. Whether one wishes it or not, one must take the opinion of experienced practical workers into consideration. Generally speaking, can one seriously maintain that several dozen and even hundreds of the directors' critics are keeping pace but that thousands and tens of thousands of functioning managers (along with other enterprise management personnel -- hundreds of thousands) are not keeping pace? Brief Conclusions 1. The results of the surveys of directors during 1993 revealed alarming trends in the prolonged decline that are acquiring the features of an irreversible loss, among which the most dangerous are the signs of the destruction of the production system and the privatization of the economic structure. 2. The directors' replies do not reveal any signs of an end to the crisis and the approach of an economic upswing. The continuing reduction in capital investments and the total paralysis of the investment process primarily testify to this. 3. It looks as if the economic reforming, which is being carried out, is beginning to give birth to anti-market tendencies: in-kind exchange, the strengthening of directive financial measures, an increase in feeble monopolistic efforts, instead of a movement toward a market economy. 4. The directors are convinced of the priority of stimulating production and, correspondingly, of the low effectiveness of purely monetary levers. 5. The survey results obtained reveal quite clearly the unpopularity of the government's economic policy among the directors -- an unpopularity with the policy of this or that composition of the government.
