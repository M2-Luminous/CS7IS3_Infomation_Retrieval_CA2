In his opinion these meetings are "a positive sign," evidence of the strength and not the weakness of the Russian Government. Although these meetings were unofficial, competent sources assert that U.S. President Bill Clinton knew of them, just as he knew of the planned meeting with V. Zhirinovskiy. Nixon's talk with A. Rutskoy took place at the general's home. Despite the fact that it lasted about two hours, almost nothing is known about it. Rutskoy is keeping it completely confidential. Just one thing is clear: The talk was conducted around a discussion of the situation in Russia and the opposition's place and role in society. Considering that this is the third meeting between its participants, the talk was quite frank and serious, obviously touching on many personal aspects of Russia's present and future leadership. So far A. Rutskoy is obviously keeping quiet about the prospects of his future political activity. But I am sure that this silence will end soon and we shall again see Aleksandr Rutskoy as a major figure on the political Olympus. As for Richard Nixon's meeting with Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of the Russian Federation Communist Party, here there was far more information. The meeting took place in the State Duma. According to the evidence of the Russian Federation Communist Party Central Executive Committee press service, there was an involved talk about the domestic political and economic situation in Russia, ways of getting it out of the crisis, and the prospects of Russian-U.S. relations. Gennadiy Zyuganov spoke unambiguously of the perniciousness of the shock therapy course and the possibility of a social eruption if it is continued. As G. Zyuganov put it, the Russian Federation Communist Party will not accept either right or left radicalism and is prepared to cooperate with all political forces which advocate the resurrection of a strong Russia. The resurrection of a renewed Union, in his opinion, is only a matter of time. Gennadiy Zyuganov told Richard Nixon about the Russian Federation Communist Party's extensive contacts with the communist parties of former union republics and countries of remote foreign parts. The Russian Federation Communist Party press service reports that Gennadiy Zyuganov stated the party's readiness to cooperate with representatives of all religions and to promote the resurrection of spirituality and thousand-year-old Russian traditions. As for cooperation with representatives of various religions, the Communists have never rejected it, but that does not mean renouncing atheism. In his talk with R. Nixon G. Zyuganov expressed the concern of all Russia's patriots at the United States' unvarying course connected with unconsidered support for the executive power unpopular with the people. It is interesting to note that Zyuganov's denunciation of the policy of the penetration of Western mass culture, the cult of violence, and pornography in the mass media met with Richard Nixon's understanding. Summing up the results of his meeting with the opposition leaders, Richard Nixon told journalists that he is inspired by the fact that the opposition leaders do not want to change the situation in the country with the aid of force.
