FR940602-0-00039 FR940602-0-00016 With regard to the AAR standards referenced in §171.7, the table contains separate entries for ``AAR Specification for Tank Cars, Specification M&hyph;1002, 1988'' and ``AAR Specification for Tank Cars, Specification M&hyph;1002, Section C_Part III, September 1988,'' which are the same standard. The first entry is removed, and the second entry is revised to clarify that this standard is contained in the AAR Manual of Standards of Recommended Practices. These changes were proposed under a separate rulemaking action [Docket HM&hyph;197; May 7, 1993; 58 FR 27257] and were supported by commenters. They are merely finalized under this docket. Sections 172.101 and 172.102 IME and several explosives companies jointly petitioned (P&hyph;1143) to amend the Hazardous Materials Table (the Table) in §172.101 to reinstate an entry for ``Ammonium nitrate fertilizer, UN2067.'' This shipping description was one of six entries for ammonium nitrate fertilizers removed from the Table under a revised final rule issued December 20, 1991 [Docket HM&hyph;181; 56 FR 66124]. Although these descriptions are contained in the United Nations' Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods (UN Recommendations), they were removed because RSPA found them confusing and difficult to use. However, petitioners assert that this shipping description, ``Ammonium nitrate fertilizer, UN2067,'' has been used widely for many years and the domestic industry has relied upon the ``Definition and Test Procedures for Ammonium Nitrate Fertilizer,'' published by The Fertilizer Institute, to ensure the stability of their material. Petitioners stated that their vehicle placards, shipping papers, and industry training procedures, including emergency response training, rely on the identification number ``2067.'' They asserted that it would be a questionable expenditure of time and money for them to convert their placards, documents and training procedures to show a different identification number. RSPA agrees with the petitioners that adequate justification exists for reauthorizing the description ``Ammonium nitrate fertilizer, UN2067.'' RSPA issued an approval (CA 93&hyph;10006) authorizing use of the description ``Ammonium nitrate fertilizer, UN2067'' not meeting Class 1 (explosive) criteria. Therefore, in this final rule, ``Ammonium nitrate fertilizer, 5.1, UN2067, III'' is added to the Table, subject to Special Provision 23. RSPA is also adding Special Provision 23 in §172.102(c)(1) stipulating that material shipped or transported under this description may not meet Class 1 (explosive) criteria. Amalgamet Canada petitioned (P&hyph;1171) to amend the entry ``Titanium Tetrachloride'' in the Table by removing Special Provision N41, which does not allow any packaging material to be made of metal construction. RSPA agrees that removal of N41 would eliminate an inconsistency with Special Provisions B32 and T45, which allow the use of certain containers made of stainless steel. RSPA is amending Special Provision B13 to extend the September 1, 1993 date for construction of cargo tanks that are equivalent to MC 306 cargo tank specifications until August 31, 1995. This change is consistent with a final rule authorizing the continued construction of MC 306 cargo tanks until August 31, 1995 [Docket HM&hyph;183, January 12, 1994; 59 FR 1784]. Section 173.34 Paragraph (e)(15)(i) was revised under Docket HM&hyph;166X [58 FR 50496; September 27, 1993] to allow DOT 3A and 3AA cylinders over 35 years old to be retested every 10 years rather than every five years, provided they were manufactured after December 31, 1945. However, §173.34(e)(15)(v) continues to allow only cylinders less then 35 years old to be stamped with a five-point star showing that these cylinders may be tested every 10 years. Therefore, in this final rule, §173.34(e)(15)(v) is revised, for consistency with paragraph (e)(15)(i), to permit cylinders manufactured after December 31, 1945, to be stamped with a five-point star. Also, because cylinders manufactured on or before December 31, 1945, do not qualify for a ten-year retest period under these provisions, the wording of paragraph (e)(15)(i) has been simplified. Paragraph (e)(17) requires DOT 8 and 8AL acetylene cylinders to be requalified, on a phase-in basis, in accordance with CGA Pamphlet C&hyph;13. Because many acetylene cylinder owners voluntarily complied with CGA Pamphlet C&hyph;13 prior to issuance of the final rule, RSPA granted an exception, in paragraph (e)(17)(ii), for all cylinders requalified and marked in accordance with the CGA pamphlet before January 15, 1993. The time required for RSPA to implement the registration procedures for acetylene cylinder retesters resulted in a backlog of requests. To alleviate unnecessary burdens to industry, RSPA has allowed retesters to continue requalifying and marking the cylinders in accordance with CGA Pamphlet C&hyph;13. Accordingly, the date in paragraph (e)(17)(ii) is revised to reflect an extension to October 1, 1994. Section 173.225 In paragraph (b), in Note 9 following the ``Organic Peroxides Table,'' the reference to ``§173.225(e)(3)(v)'' is corrected to read ``§173.225(e)(3)(ii).'' Section 173.247 In revisions to a final rule concerning the transport of elevated temperature materials [Docket HM&hyph;198A; 58 FR 3344; January 8, 1993], RSPA revised the bulk packaging requirements for the transport of asphalt by highway in §173.247. In paragraph (g)(1)(iii)(B), to ensure that a reclosing pressure relief device is not rendered inoperable by viscous lading, RSPA allowed an opening with a maximum three-inch nominal pipe diameter. The maximum effective area of the opening was incorrectly given as 46 cm2 (7.1 in2). The correct maximum effective area is 48 cm2 (7.4 in2). This final rule corrects this error. Sections 173.302 and 173.304 Sections 173.302(h) and 173.304(g) provide that mixtures meeting Division 2.3, Hazard Zone A, must conform to §173.40. These provisions are revised to clarify that §173.40 applies to a pure gas, as well as a gas mixture, meeting Division 2.3, Hazard A. Section 173.306 In a final rule published on December 20, 1991 [Docket HM&hyph;181; 56 FR 66124], RSPA revised the limited quantity provisions in §173.306(b)(3) to include Division 6.1 Packing Group III materials. Through an oversight, a similar revision was not made to the aerosol provisions contained in paragraph (a)(3). Therefore, in this final rule, RSPA is amending paragraph (a)(3) by adding the phrase ``(other than a Division 6.1 Packing Group III material).''
