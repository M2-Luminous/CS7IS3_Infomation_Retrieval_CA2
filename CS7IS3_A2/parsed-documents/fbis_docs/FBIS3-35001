The offense began when Hizballah launched katyusha rockets at targets in the eastern sector of the south Lebanon security zone. Most landed in open areas without causing either injuries or damage, with Hizballah continuing the attack with RPG antitank rockets. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and SLA [South Lebanese Army] hit back with tank fire, and according to Lebanese radio reports battle helicopters strafed the area of Kafr Shuba in the security zone, while war planes patrolled the skies. Other areas hit by RPG, machine-gun fire, and light weapons fire were al-Hamra' bridge in the western sector, and around Marj 'Uyun. Shaykh Musawi, one of the most prominent Hizballah leaders in the south, died when his car was hit by Israeli helicopter fire near his home in Jibshit. [passage omitted]
