The South Pacific correspondent, Erina Reddan, reports that Fiji's newly elected government wants to rejoin the Commonwealth and reestablish diplomatic links with India. [Begin Reddan recording] Fiji left the Commonwealth in the wake of two military coups in 1987 which overthrew an Indo-Fijian dominated government. It broke off diplomatic links with India in 1989 after accusing an embassy staffer of interfering in local politics. Now elected for a second term as prime minister, one-time coup leader Sitiveni Rabuka says he wants a new era of racial harmony between Fijians and Indo-Fijians. The racist constitution which guarantees Fijians' political dominance over Fiji Indians must be reviewed by 1997. The spokesperson, (Jauna Nakabua), says it could be well enough on the way by 1995 to satisfy the Commonwealth that it meets its protection of human rights principles. [end recording]
