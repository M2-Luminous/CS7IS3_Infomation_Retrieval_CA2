In reply to a question on whether secret contacts were being held with Syria, the prime minister said that some things should be probed secretly before the sides make public commitments. This was how things had been done in the negotiations with Egypt, as well as in those with the PLO. Responding to a question on whether 'Arafat had requested that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] activity in the territories be curtailed, Yitzhaq Rabin said various requests had been submitted, but nothing has been promised. He maintained that the problem lay in people's focusing on gestures, rather than the agreement itself. Our correspondent Qaysar Qabaha reports that the prime minister made these remarks in an interview with Nazareth's AL-SINARAH weekly.
