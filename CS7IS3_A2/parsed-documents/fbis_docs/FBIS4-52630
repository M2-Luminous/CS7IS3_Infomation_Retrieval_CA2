The current annual interest rate of 11-14 percent for savings will also rise by 0.5 percent. This is absolutely unavoidable. Singapore and Hong Kong, among other nations, have also raised their interest rates on loans. Even though they are considered high nominally, Indonesia's rates are among the lowest if you take into account inflation (based on the evaluation of bankers as well as consumer index prices) and foreign interest rates on loans. An increase would definitely impose a heavier burden on economic sectors that acquire loans from foreign banks, because such loans would have to be repaid at higher interest rates. This would not, however, create upheaval in the country's monetary sector or in its macroeconomy. On the other hand, should interest rates on foreign loans remain as they are, an economic predicament will arise. There would be, among other things, capital flight to other countries. As such, a rise in interest rates on foreign loans by the banking sector is not considered a major issue that could agitate Indonesia's economy. The major problem, if there are any within the banking sector, would only relate to the issues of loans and stagnant credit. These issues are currently negating the country's economic and physical development. Such problems are our own domestic issue. The globalization of the economy, information, and telecommunications has brought problems to Indonesia's banking sector with regard to loans and stagnant credit as well as investors and potential foreign investors who are interested in coming to Indonesia. The government is continuously trying to solve major problems. Solving major problems can be time-consuming. We are fortunate because foreign and other potential investors still trust our officials' credibility, capability, and monetary policies in trying to overcome major problems. They are still making careful observations and adopting a wait- and-see [preceding three words in English] attitude as to what steps the government will take in its efforts to solve the problems. The terms "credit policies" and "loans based on notes," which are circulating among them, indicate what approaches they would like to see toward these problems before committing to any investments in Indonesia. What do we need with their approaches when such matters are our domestic concern? In the current era of globalization -- and even more so in the future -- there will be no line drawn between domestic and global concerns. In fact, it will come as no surprise if domestic issues are always taken into consideration. Foreign investors and potential investors are important to Indonesia, and they are part of the global economy. Economic transactions between investors and Indonesia are based on mutual benefit (win-win situation) [preceding three words in English] and will no longer be based on a presumption of winners and losers. In the eyes of foreign investors, Indonesia could lose as a result of problems arising from the acquisition of foreign loans and the stagnant credit faced by banks, which in turn could spur foreign investors to reconsider making investments in the country. Indonesia needs foreign investors, whether it is direct investment in industrial development or in the country's share or capital markets. Instability will definitely send investors flocking to China, India, Thailand, Malaysia, and even the Philippines. Within the context of international economic globalization, no nation can determine on its own what steps it should take. Our problem is how to coordinate Indonesian interests with those of other countries. In the process of economic globalization, we should only acquire through compromise, trade transactions, and investment what belongs to us, while others should only take what belongs to them. Once again, in connection with the problem of foreign loans and stagnant credit within our economy, we suggest that in this era of economic globalization these problems should not be solved according to our own terms.
