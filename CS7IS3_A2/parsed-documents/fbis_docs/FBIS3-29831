The paper says the rural theses is a perfect programme of rural construction which indicates the way of a most successful solution of the socialist rural question on the basis of the chuche idea. It quotes the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as saying: "`Theses on the socialist rural question in our country' authored by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is our party's programme of building the countryside and a bright blueprint for a final solution of the rural question." In the past period the theses has been successfully applied to the rural construction in Korea, demonstrating its great vitality and proving its greatness, correctness and truth, the paper notes, and goes on: The validity and invincible vitality of the rural theses lie, above all, in that it has powerfully accelerated the revolutionization and working-classization of the peasants and immensely strengthened the driving force of socialism in the countryside. All the agricultural working people in Korea are now firmly armed with the great chuche idea of our party and closely rallied behind the party and the leader in ideology and purpose and in-morality and sense of obligation. They are making vigorous efforts to bringing into practice the party's far-reaching plan of rural construction, helping and leading each other forward under the slogan of collectivism--one for all and all for one. This is the noble traits of our peasants. Its validity and vitality are also manifested in that it has constantly consolidated the material and technical foundations of the rural economy and brought a fresh development of the agricultural production. With the successful implementation of the policy of rural technical revolution, irrigation and electrification were flawlessly completed on a high level long ago and a signal progress has been made in mechanization and extensive use of chemicals in Korea. Modern means of agricultural science and technique have been massively introduced into the rural economy and the most advantageous chuche farming method has been applied with the result that Korea reaps bumper crops every year. The validity and vitality of the theses are highly displayed also in that the level of guidance and management of the rural economy has been steadily enhanced and the gap between towns and countryside considerably narrowed in all spheres. Thanks to the chuche-based agricultural guidance system with the county cooperative farm management committee as its center, the guidance and management of the rural economy have been improved and the leadership role of the all-people property over cooperative property enhanced to eliminate the distinctions between the towns and rural areas in ownership and management. The level of the general knowledge of the peasantry and their technical and cultural standards have been markedly raised with the cultural revolution pushed ahead in the countryside, and the gap between the towns and the countryside in cultural living conditions has been narrowed with the introduction of water and bus services into the countryside and the expansion of the TV networks to cover it and the conversion of village clinics into hospitals. Those proud victory and achievements made in rural construction through the successful application of the great rural theses in Korea are entirely results of the wise leadership of the party and the leader, concludes the article.
