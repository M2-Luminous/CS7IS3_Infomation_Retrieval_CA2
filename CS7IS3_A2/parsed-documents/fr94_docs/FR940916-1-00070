FR940916-1-00070 FR940916-1-00016 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, Chief, Motive Power and Equipment Division, Office of Safety, RRS&hyph;14, Room 8326, FRA, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590 (telephone 202&hyph;366&hyph;4094 or 202&hyph;366&hyph;9186), or Thomas Herrmann, Trial Attorney, Office of the Chief Counsel, FRA, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590 (telephone 202&hyph;366&hyph;0628). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: INTRODUCTION Background 49 U.S.C. ยง20141 (formerly contained in Section 7 of the Rail Safety Enforcement and Review Act (RSERA), Pub. L. No. 102&hyph;365 (September 3, 1992), amending Section 202 of the Federal Railroad Safety Act (FRSA) of 1970, formerly codified at 45 U.S.C. 421, 431 et seq. ), by adding a new subsection related to power brake safety which states: (r) POWER BRAKE SAFETY._(1) The Secretary shall conduct a review of the Department of Transportation's rules with respect to railroad power brakes, and not later than December 31, 1993, shall revise such rules based on such safety data as may be presented during that review. (2) In carrying out paragraph (1), the Secretary shall, where applicable, prescribe standards regarding dynamic brake equipment. (3)(A) The Secretary shall require 2-way end of train devices (or devices able to perform the same function) on road trains other than locals, road switchers, or work trains to enable the initiation of emergency braking from the rear of the train. The Secretary shall promulgate rules as soon as possible, but not later than December 31, 1993, requiring such 2-way end of train devices. Such rules shall at a minimum_ (i) set standards for such devices based on performance; (ii) prohibit any railroad, on or after the date that is one year after promulgation of such rules, from acquiring any end of train device for use on trains which is not a 2-way device meeting the standards set under clause (i); (iii) require that such trains be equipped with 2-way end of train devices meeting such standards not later than 4 years after promulgation of such rules; and (iv) provide that any 2-way end of train device acquired for use on trains before such promulgation shall be deemed to meet such standards. (B) The Secretary may consider petitions to amend the rules promulgated under subparagraph (A) to allow the use of alternative technologies which meet the same basic performance requirements established by such rules. (C) In developing the rules required by subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall consider data presented under paragraph (1). (4) The Secretary may exclude from the rules required by paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) any category of trains or rail operations if the Secretary determines that such an exclusion is in the public interest and is consistent with railroad safety. The Secretary shall make public the reasons for granting any such exclusion. The Secretary shall at a minimum exclude from the requirements of paragraph (3)_ (A) trains that have manned cabooses; (B) passenger trains with emergency brakes; (C) trains that operate exclusively on track that is not part of the general railroad system; (D) trains that do not exceed 30 miles per hour and do not operate on heavy grades, except for any categories of such trains specifically designated by the Secretary; and (E) trains that operate in a push mode. Pub. L. No. 102&hyph;365, ยง7; 45 U.S.C. 431(r). On December 31, 1992, FRA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) concerning the possible revision of the power brake regulations (57 FR 62546). The ANPRM provided background information and presented questions on various subjects including: the use and design of end-of-train (EOT) telemetry devices; the air flow method of train brake testing; the additional testing of train air brakes during extremely cold weather; the training of employees to perform train brake tests and inspections; computer-assisted braking systems; the operation of dynamic brakes on locomotives; and other miscellaneous subjects relating to conventional brake systems as well as information regarding high speed passenger train brakes. The questions presented in the ANPRM on the various topics were intended as fact-finding tools and were intended to elicit the views of those persons outside FRA charged with ensuring compliance with the power brake regulations on a day-to-day basis. Following publication of the ANPRM, FRA conducted four days of technical workshops in early 1993 to elicit information and views. Workshops were conducted in Kansas City, Missouri on February 17; in Chicago, Illinois on March 2 and 3; and in Newark, New Jersey on March 9. These workshops were attended by at least seventeen railroads, three organizations representing railroads, four labor organizations and various individual members of the organizations, four manufacturers of train brake-related equipment, and several governmental agencies. Written comments were received from most of these parties or their individual members. In addition to the written comments received from the parties that attended the workshops, written comments were also received from one other railroad, one state public utilities commission, one state transit authority, and one private citizen. FRA has carefully considered all of the oral and written comments offered by the various parties. The resulting Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) is based on these comments as well as FRA's experience with enforcing the current power brake regulations.
