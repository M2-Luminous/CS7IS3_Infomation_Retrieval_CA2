A. Niyazov of Turkmenistan pledged in their formal talks today to expand the scope of bilateral cooperation. The two leaders, in two rounds of talks held at the presidential palace, had an in-depth exchange of views on ways of furthering bilateral relations as well as on regional and international issues of common concern, in what a Chinese spokesman called "a cordial and friendly atmosphere." Li Peng and Niyazov were satisfied with the "steady and smooth" expansion of bilateral ties since the two countries forged diplomatic relations in early 1992, according to the source. Li Peng said President Niyazov's successful visit to China in 1992 "opened a new chapter in the annals of friendship between China and Turkmenistan." The two countries enjoy a good political relationship, and their economic ties are expanding, showing vast potentials for development, Li noted. He added that "with mutual understanding and trust, we have reason to believe in further growth of such ties." Niyazov said that Li's visit is long-awaited, "but this does not mean we have any differences or urgent problems to be addressed. Instead, it shows Turkmenistan's sincerity for developing relations with China." "We admire China's long history, brilliant culture and industrious people, as well as its leadership's wisdom," the spokesman quoted Niyazov as saying. The president said he learned a lot during his visit to China in 1992, which he said is useful reference. However, he added, as conditions in Turkmenistan are different, "we would not simply copy China's experience." Li agreed with that, saying that a country knows best its own history, tradition and characteristics, and instead of copying a foreign mode, should go along a path of development compatible with its own national conditions. "The government of Turkmenistan is doing just that," he said. "China fully understands and respects Turkmenistan's domestic and foreign policy." Li, referring to bilateral economic cooperation, which is only at its initial stage with a modest trade volume, noted that both countries are sincere to expand trade and economic cooperation. Relevant departments of the two countries are discussing ways of expanding the scope and tapping the potentials of such cooperation, he said. With political stability and abundant reserves of oil and gas, Turkmenistan is in a good position to revitalize the economy, Li said, calling the country's on-going economic readjustment "a wise move," which will serve to boost economic development. Touching on potential cooperation in building a gas pipeline, Li said that would be a project extending into the next century, which requires a thorough feasibility study. "If it is indeed feasible, such a project will benefit all parties concerned," he said. "China is willing to explore the possibilities in this regard, together with relevant countries, including Turkmenistan." China and Turkmenistan can cooperate in other fields as well, he said, adding he expected the top Chinese entrepreneurs traveling with him to have close contact with their local counterparts and strive for "concrete results." Niyazov briefed Li on Turkmenistan's relations with other nations of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and the neighboring countries, saying his country maintains good, normal nation-to- nation ties with them. During the talks, Li gave an account of the minority nationalities in China. Owing to China's correct policy on nationalities, the Xinjiang Autonomous Region and other areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups, just like other parts of the country, enjoy political stability, economic development and considerable improvement in people's livelihood, he said. Niyazov said Turkmenistan respects China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, appreciates its policy on nationalities, and opposes national splittism, according to the source.
