Half of them have returned to the country. The public relations office of Iran's Embassy in Bonn reports that these people left Iran without authorization for various reasons, including such things as the fact that they were forbidden to leave, their obligatory military service status was unclear or they were planning to continue their educations. However, following KEYHAN-E HAVA'I's interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Manuchehr Motaki and the clear announcement of the Iranian Government's new policy to grant Iranian visas to all compatriots outside the country lacking identity papers, they went to our country's representative offices in Germany and obtained visas. According to the report from the public relations office of the Iranian Embassy in Bonn, last year more than 1,000 Iranians who obtained visas returned to the country from Germany. Based on the same report, thousands of Iranians living in Germany, using the facilities created for them, are happily reporting to Iran's Embassy and Consulates and preparing to go to Iran with hopes of returning to the embrace of their families. Also, one month prior to this, KEYHAN-E HAVA'I reported the issuance of visas for 150 compatriots living in Rome and the return of many of them to Iran. It is worth mentioning that on page 1 of KEYHAN-E HAVA'I issue 1,078 it was reported that the number of Iranians living in Germany who obtained Iranian visas last year was 1,000, but the correct figure is 2,000.
