According to this plan, 318 kilometers of highways and modern roads will be constructed by 1999, leading from the West (Koper) to the East (Lendava), branching off in the direction of Sezana and Nova Gorica (Italy) and Sentilj (Austria). The project should stimulate a new investment cycle. In July, the State Assembly ratified the transportation agreement between the Republic of Slovenia and the European Union [EU]. (One of six European routes between East and West, the Barcelona-Kiev route, crosses Slovenia.) The EU agreed to provide 150 million ECU's during the next three years. The highway planning, construction, maintenance, and management will be supervised by the newly established Slovene Highway Authority (DARS), which will begin construction this year on nine sections, including Arja Vas-Vransko, Hoce-Arja Vas, and Sentilj-Pesnica, totaling 121 kilometers, as reported by STA [Slovene Press Agency].
