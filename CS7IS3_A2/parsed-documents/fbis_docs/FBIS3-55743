Following recent unlawful actions in respect of the Black Sea Fleet naval engineering service departments in Odessa and Nikolayev, another action has been staged, aimed at having the Izmail region's personnel swear allegiance to Ukraine." The press center of the Black Sea Fleet affirms that the fleet's group of units deployed in Izmail has virtually found itself under economic blockade. To normalize the situation and prevent further negative developments, the Black Sea Fleet Command has called for wisdom on the part of the Ukrainian Navy Command and voiced the opinion that it is necessary to wait until the Black Sea Fleet issues are settled by the Russian and Ukrainian presidents in a civilized manner. The Black Sea Fleet leadership has sent relevant documents on the situation in Izmail to the Ukrainian and Russian defense ministries.
