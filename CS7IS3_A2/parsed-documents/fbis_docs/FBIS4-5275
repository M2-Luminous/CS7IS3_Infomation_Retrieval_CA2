The city, which considers the crashes involving the helicopter and an F-15 fighter to be an issue arising from U.S. military bases existing in central Okinawa, decided at the extraordinary meeting to call on cities, towns, and villages in central Okinawa to take actions to protest the crashes. Meanwhile, the Special Committee on U.S. Military Bases (chaired by Seiei Chimen) of the Ginowan City Assembly (chaired by Harunobu Nakamura) held a session at 1000 on the morning of 7 April to decide that the assembly holds an extraordinary session to adopt a resolution and a statement demanding a halt to flight training by U.S. forces over residential areas and an early return of the Futenma Air Station. The extraordinary session is scheduled to open at 1400 on the afternoon of 7 April. Members of the Special Committee on U.S. Military Bases took a look at the crash site from outside of the Futenma Air Station and confirmed that debris from the crashed helicopter landed on the roof of Mr. Kiuma's house. They then entered the air station through the Oyama gate to tour the crash site. On 7 April, one day after the helicopter crash, Ginowan city remained relatively calm with almost no helicopter noise being heard. The helicopter in question broke into two pieces when it crashed, and it remains that way, with only its debris having been recovered. In the past, the Ginowan City Assembly adopted resolutions protesting against the crash and overturning of a CH-46 helicopter on Futenma Air Station runway in October 1992 and against the dropping of a set of repair tools by a UH-1 helicopter onto the prefectural highway in Nakagutsuku town in October 1993.
