Secretary of State for Education John Patten said effort needed to be made to put mutual relations back into the warm waters. Malaysia barred British companies from bidding for public sector contracts in February following publication of unsubstantiated allegations of corruption against Malaysian leaders in the British media. Speaking to reporters at the British Council here a few hours after his arrival yesterday, Patten said he was disappointed by the effect of reports in the British press on the relationship between the two countries. As Douglas Hurd (British Foreign Secretary) said in the House of Commons last Wednesday, we should not allow the press to come between us, he said. He said both Hurd and Trade Secretary Richard Needham had made it clear that Britain wished to see a resumption of normal relations as soon as possible. Patten added Britain would continue to work vigorously to bring about a situation in which the Malaysian Government felt able to lift its ban on public sector contracts for British companies. Certainly the British press had been pretty quiet on this issue over the last two or three weeks, he said. Asked about Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed's stand on the matter, he said the Malaysian leader had always been a very powerful advocate of Malaysia's case internationally. He said Dr. Mahathir had made his views known especially in a very striking letter to the FINANCIAL TIMES of London a few weeks ago.
