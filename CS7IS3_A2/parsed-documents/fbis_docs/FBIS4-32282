On arrival at the Otopeni Airport, Mr. Tinca said the two tours abroad had ended with positive results. "What counts is that now I feel a stronger sense of responsibility than I used to have before my departure, and that is because the results of these visits invite us to proceed as fast as possible to concrete actions. The time for statements and shows of will is gone, in my opinion. People expect us to join very palpable cooperation actions," Mr. Tinca said.
