Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says that the Japanese reactionaries overheated in their ambition for reinvasion are trying to move up the time of action. The news analyst says: "Studies of an emergency on the Korean peninsula" proposed by Sakuma may be called a plan for a Korean war in the 90s after the end of the Cold War. Such move of Japan is all the more grave because it is timed to coincide with the intensified activities of the United States and the South Korean puppets for a war against the North. Its gravity lies in that Japan has been put in the position of "a party concerned" with a new Korean war. The Japanese reactionaries have chosen the Korean peninsula as the first target of their military aggression overseas. Their haste in "studies of an emergency on the Korean peninsula", in fact, suggests that they, together with the South Korean puppets, are rounding off an operational plan to start a war of aggression in Korea and watching for a chance to carry it into practice. The Korean people will never allow the repetition of the history of aggression by the Japanese imperialists and we are prepared to resolutely react, if anybody attempt to infringe upon our sovereignty and dignity. Japanese samurais must act with discretion, mindful that aggression and war will lead them to destruction.
