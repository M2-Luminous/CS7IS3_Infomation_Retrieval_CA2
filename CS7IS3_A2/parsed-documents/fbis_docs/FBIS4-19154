With voting figures of 101 to 63 she knocked out her main opponent, Sten Dybeck, in the second round of voting. Outgoing party leader Ian Wachtmeister, who supported Dybeck, was most dissatisfied with the outcome of the election. Instead of congratulating his successor, he openly criticized Colliander at the congress for a lack of leadership. "That felt a bit sad. If we are going to have any peace so we can work in the Riksdag group I think it is best that Wachtmeister leaves his seat in the Riksdag," Colliander responded a little later at an improvised press conference. Harriet Colliander is the leader of New Democracy's group in the Riksdag. This is another post she has taken over after Ian Wachtmeister after he announced that he would leave the post of party chairman. Colliander is single, has two grownup children, and is closer to the political center than her predecessor. However, she denied that the election of a new party leader will mean a shift to the left in New Democracy's policies. "But in future we will not be as unconditional in our support for the government as we have been in the past," she said. Harriet Colliander also claimed that New Democracy will become more democratic under her leadership. For example, she is critical of the party organization that was forced through and which means that the Riksdag party only enters into cooperation agreements with local party organizations. "For the party to be able to be strong it must see itself as a whole," she declared, adding that she wants the return of the old arrangement under which local associations were also formally part of New Democracy. The election of a new party leader on Saturday evening had been preceded by a long and bitter power struggle within New Democracy, with one side chiefly represented by Harriet Colliander and Bert Karlsson and the other by Ian Wachtmeister and his supporters. For several weeks the two factions have been fighting each other in the media and at the party's offices in Stockholm. Several people have resigned or taken sick leave after divisive rows. Despite this internal conflict Harriet Colliander believes she can unite the party. "After everything that has happened I believe everyone is longing for peace and quiet. It therefore would be tragic if Ian Wachtmeister were the one in the party upsetting its internal calm," she said. Ian Wachtmeister, who left the party congress immediately after Colliander was elected his successor, thinks that she must give evidence of clearer leadership if the party is to be welded together again. "I think that she will have a much more difficult time uniting the party than Sten Dybeck. Not least because she belongs to one faction and therefore carries a taint. But there is a chance if Harriet sharpens up her ideas and becomes a leader instead of someone who allows herself to be led," said Wachtmeister, who claimed that it is Bert Karlsson who controls the new party leader. [passage omitted] The wounds go deep after the conflict within New Democracy. Ian Wachtmeister himself was only partially successful when it came to winning some redress from the congress, which he has been demanding since the party executive stripped him of all powers as party leader last week. Wachtmeister had demanded that the congress dissociate itself from the majority on the party executive, including Harriet Colliander. Instead the congress only adopted a general statement put together by Bo Sillen to the effect that the executive's decision was incorrect and that it had harmed Wachtmeister.
