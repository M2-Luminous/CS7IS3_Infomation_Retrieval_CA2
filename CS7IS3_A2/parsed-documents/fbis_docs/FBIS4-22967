I. Levchenko, A. A. Savinov, Institute of Mathematics, Moscow; UDC 658.012.011.56] [Abstract] This article proposes an approach to the construction of diagnostic expert systems based on a special matrix representation of fuzzy predicates in a test model of a subject field. A sectioned matrix is a fuzzy analog of a conjunctive normal form of predicate representation. One may use rules, examples, and counterexamples to form the knowledge base. Fuzzy rules are used to interpret elements of a common nonfuzzy set. The most important assertions of the logic of predicates can be generalized to the fuzzy case. The diagnostics problem is understood to be the acquisition of information on possible values of some indicator if there is data on the values of other indicators. The basis of logical deduction is the operation of fuzzy resolution, which is used to find sample disjunctions. An expert system shell, EPID, is implemented on the basis of the formalisms presented here. Figures 3; references 12: 6 Russian, 6 Western.
