The University of Tokyo Science Department Physics Section and the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN) are applying this and the research institutes of the Agency of Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) are introducing the same type of system. Efforts are made to avoid complacency and aim for the Center of Excellence (COE), but will this truly change Japan's research organizations? RIKEN Director General Minoru Oda was asked. Boards of Directors Also the Subject NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN: RIKEN has had a system for evaluation of the results of research in the past. What was the goal of this? ODA: Researchers in charge are reviewed every seven years and leaders of the frontier research system are also reviewed in the middle and at the end of the research period and are exposed to severe evaluation. So, what about in terms of organization management? In the board of directors about three and a half years ago, the subject of possibly reviewing the board of directors as well came up. Immediately, my friend Professor Clark of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology came for about one week, but the areas of research in RIKEN are extensive. An advisory council of fifteen people from in the five areas of physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and medicine was formed and was asked to make a periodic review every two years. NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN: Can appropriate evaluation be made in several days observation? ODA: Two white papers showing in detail the management mechanisms, research headings, and budgets were made and sent in advance. Observation was for three days, but I think they saw well. We showed all the weak and strong spots of RIKEN. Some delegates said that research details were understood and became references. They are also rivals in this research, but if a sincere review is expected, we are resigned to show our capacities without reserve. It was decided to replace one third of the committee to avoid people saying what everyone else said. Without Strict Evaluation NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN: Though a special request was made of the personnel system, there were no strict indications. ODA: With indiscriminate praise for research results, one feels inferior. The indication that public appeals for researchers in charge (lifelong work) have expanded globally is received seriously. Currently as well, we would like to open the gate, conduct conferences in the institute in English, tear down so-called walls, and invite superior human resources. Also, the proposal to raise the age limit to employment of a general researcher (less than 32 years of age as a rule) was a little unexpected. The conscious customary rule is the promotion of young people, but there may be ill effects if operated by hard and fast regulations. In a certain sense, public reports may draw thorns, but for myself, straightforward opinions such as ``this research is not important'' in notes or orally also contribute. The proposal establishes committee meetings in the institute and would like to be related to improvements. Difficulty in National Research Institutes NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN: The chief executive officer has worked on the review of the University of Tokyo and U.S. national research institutes and also has experience on the ``evaluation side.'' Are the opinions of outsiders really viable? ODA: Whether a research organization is lively and whether there are management problems are not understood from papers. External review is important for activation. Of course, if sufficient information is not disclosed, it is incomplete and meaningless because of neglect. It is not said that the accommodation of RIKEN was the maximum, but was made as clear as possible. The attitude of the evaluation makes or breaks the review. RIKEN has a tradition of freely doing basic research and is favored. Before, I was at a university, but at the university I had autonomy and was afraid of external evaluation and contrary proposals. There were many problems difficult to resolve just by the efforts on the part of the university, such as the budget and system. Even so we thought to expand the review system. NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN: The AIST National Institute for Advanced Interdisciplinary Research will soon introduce external evaluation. ODA: This is basically good. But, generally the review of national institutes is thought to be more difficult than for universities. This is because even though the value of research is not superior in national institutes, the themes are those which must advance as national policy. The more facts are known, straightforward review becomes difficult. Isn't there danger of declaring it was done strictly and stopping? Viewpoint: Necessity to Remove Walls in the System [Author Mikio Kamino] The establishment of the advisory council is the so-called ``parting gift'' of Director Oda who is retiring at the end of this month. How to make the most of the review has become the assignment. Because the University of Tokyo and RIKEN both honor students, they have taken the plunge into review. In the future, many other universities and public research organizations criticized of ``lukewarm constitution'' will require strict evaluation, but Mr. Oda also mentions that this is not so simple. Universities and national research institutions introducing external review may increase more, but it is necessary to open the way to reforming systems such as personnel and budget since it may just be a pose of researchers showing ``humility.'' This will just burden with an assignment which cannot be solved and nothing will change.
