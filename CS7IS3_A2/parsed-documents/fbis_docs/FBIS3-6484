Also, it has gained a noble achievement in maintaining the solid unity and cohesion with them. The people's absolute trust in the party is just a true revolutionary ethos in our society. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: Our people only recognize the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] as their political guide and totally entrust their fate to the party. They are also overflowing with a firm resolution to consummate the chuche revolutionary cause to the end under the leadership of the party. The devotion and greatness of our party -- which sacrifices itself to the interest and happiness of the popular masses -- our people's absolute support and trust in the party, and the invincibility of the unity and cohesion between the party and the popular masses have been fully embodied in our social ethos in which the party serves the people, while the people trust and follow it. The party's political leadership for the masses and the people's trust in the party are inseparably related to each other. The people's trust in the party will be deepened only if the party's leadership, the party's politics, serves the popular masses.

Ties between the party and the masses can be maintained based on the people's absolute trust in the party. Also, the people's trust in the party can be consolidated based on the party's people- oriented policy. If the party encroaches upon the interest of the popular masses or carries out a policy running counter to the people's intent, it cannot obtain support from the masses nor maintain close ties of kinship with them. Our party has given priority to satisfying the demands of the people even when it has to adopt a decision.

This is why our people entirely entrust their destinies to our party and fight through fire and water for the party. Our party also wins the people's great confidence by providing all members of society with worthy lives and by trusting them. The party's and leader's trust is the ideological and spiritual source that makes the popular masses trust the party and the leader. People can enjoy worthy lives because they trust the party and the leader. Our people's confidence in the party is being amplified by our party's trust that guides and enables them to glorify their valuable political lives forever.
