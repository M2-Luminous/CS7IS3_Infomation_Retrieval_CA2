A police spokesman, General Leon Mellett, said it was a pity that the ANC had tried to politicize an incident in which the police were pursuing a criminal suspect. He said the suspect was being sought in connection with three murders, eight attempted murders, and the possession of explosives and unlawful firearms. The raid was carried out in response to information that the man had been involved in a shooting with three policemen in Khayelitsha. General Mellett said the ANC should say why it had hindered the police in their search of the building.
