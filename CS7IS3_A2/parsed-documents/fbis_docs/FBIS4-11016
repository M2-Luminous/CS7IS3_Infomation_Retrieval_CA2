Ortega Discusses `Established Opinions' Within FSLN PA1904215794 Managua Canal Cuatro Television in Spanish 0400 GMT 14 Apr 94 PA1904215794 Managua Canal Cuatro Television Spanish BFN [Report by Susy Castillo; from the "Extravision" newscast; passages within quotation marks recorded] [Text] [Castillo] For the first time, and before a battery of journalists, former President Daniel Ortega, FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] secretary general, has commented on the so-called currents of opinion that have emerged within Sandinism in anticipation of the upcoming FSLN congress in May: [Ortega] "Sandinism is the most democratic expression among this country's political forces, as clearly reflected by the many compatriots voicing views that are even contradictory. It is democracy at work." [Castillo] The media have termed the differences among the various groups as currents within Sandinism, but Ortega has called them opinions [estados de opinion]. [Ortega] "We do not call them currents. I call them established opinions. There are no currents established in the FSLN. There are established opinions, established groups. I think these positions are part of the democratic game that has emerged with great force within Sandinism. I think nobody should feel ashamed for his position. "I would be ashamed if I stopped fighting along with the people and the poor, if I became an instrument of Capitalists, of the rich, and the bourgeoisie, and if I surrendered and knelt before imperialism. I would be ashamed by those things." [Castillo] Why is there talk of establishing a new FSLN, a more democratic FSLN? Is the FSLN undemocratic? [Ortega] "This is a new kind of democratic process that started with the previous FSLN congress. We held an election; it was a normal election, normal for political parties, revolutionary as well as Social Democratic ones; it was an election based on tickets [eleccion por plancha]. "Thus, we established democratic mechanisms. For the first time, in 1991, the FSLN discussed a program and statutes; it approved programs and statutes. That had never happened in FSLN history. This was done democratically; that is, democracy made its appearance within Sandinism in a new form in 1991. We must now continue to strengthen democracy. "In closing the 1991 congress, speaking on behalf of the FSLN directorate, I told participants that at the next congress we would have to become more democratic. I added that this would entail incorporating women in all groups of leadership, including the National Directorate, that the elections for all posts should be done by secret ballots, and that there should be individual candidates, not tickets. "Thus, this is nothing new. These are issues we already discussed and announced. We called a congress precisely because we want to renew and increase democracy within Sandinism. This was my initiative. I consulted it with my fellow directorate members on 19 July and announced it in the square, and the Sandinist Assembly approved it later." [Castillo] For the first time, Ortega admitted differences within Sandinism that stem from a confusing position toward the government. [Unidentified reporter] "What is the main difference? [Ortega] "I think the main difference concerns the fact that in 1990, with the change of government, we defined a policy toward this government that was not very clear, a policy that bred confusion. This position prompted a sector of Sandinism to follow one line and another sector to follow another; in other words, our position toward the government has, in fact, divided Sandinists. "This is why when we say that during the congress we must reach a consensus regarding our position toward the government, we must do so with the conviction that it will reunify and strengthen us. Concerning the United States, Sandinists must reach a single position toward this country regarding our methods of struggle. I am talking about very specific aspects that lead to the emergence of different positions, even contradictions, as the ones we have seen. "Thus, we must not overlook contradictions. The way to confront contradictions is through organized and orderly discussions through a (?special) congress, which we already summoned."
