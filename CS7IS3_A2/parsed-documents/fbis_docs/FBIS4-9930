These suggestions were made in an editorial of COYUNTURA ECONOMICA, which will be in circulation within the next few days. According to Fedesarrollo's director, Eduardo Lora, only if those three steps are taken will the government and the Bank of the Republic's board of directors be able to control inflation and avoid revaluation. According to Fedesarrollo's analysis, even though the Colombian economy is behaving very positively, it is essential to introduce corrections in order to slow down the accelerated growth of demand and the entry of foreign currency. Domestic demand for goods and services is growing at 11 percent, while it should not exceed 5 percent. That is, it should grow at the annual rate of the GDP [gross domestic product]. The foundation called Minister of Finance Rudolf Hommes' idea for lowering domestic interest rates in order to reduce the differential with international rates unworkable. "If that is done, it will trigger an acceleration of domestic demand, making inflation even harder to control," said Lora. About a year ago Fedesarrollo had proposed reducing domestic interest rates, but Lora said the circumstances at that time were different, for then there was no excessive demand or much business activity. "A decline in interest rates would accelerate demand and generate higher inflation. Actually, to reduce the amount of foreign currency entering Colombia by equalizing domestic and foreign interest rates, we would need to lower domestic rates by about 10 points, and that would be catastrophic in terms of controlling inflation," said Lora. He added: "If anything should be done to interest rates, they should be raised, or at least kept at their current levels, but not lowered." Even though Fedesarrollo recognizes the success of the government's handling of the economy, he cited the need to introduce tax controls on foreign credit to deter money laundering and slow down the massive influx of foreign currency. The foundation did not propose specific controls, but suggested introducing a 48 percent cash reserves requirement for all foreign credit, not just for loans made for an 18-month term, as in the current procedure. Credit Soaring Fedesarrollo said private sector loans are now at levels of $200 million a month; until October 1993 the average was only $40 million a month. Fedesarrollo also asked the government to make a new cut in public spending by at least the amount announced at the start of this year, equivalent to 360 billion pesos. Fedesarrollo's director, Eduardo Lora, said that one cause of the inflation reported during February is that the government did not cut spending by the amount it had announced. According to Fedesarrollo, the February acceleration of the cost of living was caused primarily by excess demand, not high food prices or educational costs. "Putting price controls on foods is not a sound way to control inflation, for even though people may reduce their spending on food, it is quite certain that they will increase their purchases of other goods," said Lora.
