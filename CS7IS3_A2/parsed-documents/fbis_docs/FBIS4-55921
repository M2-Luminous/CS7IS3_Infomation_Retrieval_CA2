The five-day visit has seen the signing of an outline memorandum on military cooperation. The Czech delegation was familiarised with the structure, management and organisation of the Israeli army, saw soldiers training and carried on a number of negotiations with both state and private military industry companies. Baudys said Israel had a very good quality, highly-organised and well-trained army, and that Israeli weapons companies were offering the Czechs what they needed -- top level technology for modernising the weapons and weapons systems used up till now. Modernisation programmes would bring new jobs and would later allow Czech companies to break into the world market, Baudys said. He stressed that no specific agreements had been signed in Israel, and that cooperation in the near future would be the subject of negotiations between companies. Oskar Sima, director of a military repair company, told CTK that one of the very attractive offers which had been made to his company was technology for the modernisation of T-72 Soviet tanks. An agreement on the supply of the technology was to be signed at the end of May, Sima said.
