In an address to the Jewish Agency's annual assembly in Jerusalem last night, Peres said the Palestinians have the right to run their own lives: [Begin Peres recording] No, I do not see any reason why we should not go ahead with what is being called the early empowerment, particularly in the large cities like Nabulus, Ramallah. Why should we be there as their tax collectors, as their teachers? They have their own curriculum. Why should we force them to read our curriculum? I mean, the idea that their agony is not necessarily our happiness is basic. You know, some people criticize me that while during the negotiations I agreed to give almost a passport to the Gazan people. I did not understand this criticism. What joy does it give us? There will be 800,000 people without passports. We did not want to give them ours. Why should we take away from them the right to have a passport? I never saw a person killing another person by hitting a passport on his head, but I saw a person killing because they did not have a passport. Let us be a little wise and generous. I do not see why should we not let the people to run their daily lives, though I admit I consider that the negotiations with the Palestinians over the principle of early empowerment, which means to hand over some of the responsibilities in the other parts of the territories to their hands, will be very complicated and very difficult, but we have to start and go ahead. [end recording] Peres also said it would be useless to link the release of Palestinian prisoners to obtaining information on missing and captured Israeli soldiers. Israel believes Ron Arad is held by Iran, which opposes the peace process, Peres said. He said the government takes the matter seriously, but he added that telling the Palestinians the peace process will not continue until more information is obtained will not help, since the missing Israelis are not being held by Yasir 'Arafat. [Begin Peres recording] We do not believe that the missing soldiers are in his hands and that the ones who have control over it are not necessarily listening to 'Arafat. So if we shall do it, we shall introduce a service against ourselves. It will be totally counterproductive. [end recording]
