The five books in the second series are: "AIDS: The Plague of the 20th Century," "Shadow Under the Olympic Flame," "the Japanese-U.S. Trade War," "Europe's Powderkeg -- A History of the Balkans," and "A Look at the U.S. Presidential Election." Xu Weicheng said he compiled this series to help readers gain a better understanding of the world. He added that this series strives for veracity and to expose the truth of the matter. The four books in the first series, "Colorful India," "China and the World at the Turn of the Century," "the Rise of Hitler," and "Mafia: the Incurable Italian Disease," were compiled following the afore-mentioned principle. The first series, published by Sichuan People's Publishing House in the end of 1991, were popular with the readers and sales of the first series has reached some 25,000 sets. A book reviewer said these books are of high taste and readable; they are not travelogues recording customs and conventions, nor are they historical documents or academic works; they have their own style. The second series retains the strong points of the first, but places added emphasis on readability. "AIDS: The Plague of the 20th Century" is the first book in China which, written from the perspective of a social scientist, systematically describes the ravages of AIDS. Presented through a true story, "The Shadow Under the Olympic Flame" tells how the spirit of the Olympics is faced with different challenges. Through an analysis of the rivalry between Japan and the United States, two economic powers which practice two different modes of capitalism, "The Japanese-U.S. Trade War" brings forth many issues that give more food for thought than that from the outcome of an economic competition. Through a retelling of the incessant wars on the Balkan peninsula, "Europe's Powderkeg -- A History of the Balkans" lets the readers look into the deeper reasons that produce the contradictions and conflicts. Through the many hubbubs that arose during Clinton's election campaign, "A Look at the U.S. Presidential Election" traces the origin of the democratic system in the West and relates some interesting events during U.S. presidential election campaigns. It has been learned that the compilation of the third "World Outlook Book Series" is now in the works.
