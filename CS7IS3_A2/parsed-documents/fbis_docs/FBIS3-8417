Lexa is state secretary for privatisation and head of the Government Office. The radio quoted Lexa as saying he was informed about the decision in a letter from the Police Investigations Office. Following Slovak President Michal Kovac's refusal last November to appoint Lexa, who is a close associate of Premier Vladimir Meciar's, as the privatisation minister, Lexa publicly questioned Kovac's expertise and morale, which led to the prosecution. After a lengthy investigation, Lexa was found to be innocent under criminal law and was referred to a district court for consideration on a breach of regulations punishable by a fine. His prosecution was sanctioned by the alleged violation of the articles 102 and 103 on defamation of the republic and the president of the republic. Bearing in mind the Helsinki Citizens' Committee efforts aimed at the removal of the two articles from the Slovak Criminal Code, the Slovak Government meanwhile raised the matter in parliament but the passage of a respective amendment was blocked by opposition deputies who thought the government proposal was a ploy intended to free Lexa, a man of the government, of the accusations.
