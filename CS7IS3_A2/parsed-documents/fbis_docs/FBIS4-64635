"It is necessary to increase the number of the council's permanent members. Japan is playing a role fitting to a permanent member state in all fields including politics and the economy. If (Japan) becomes a permanent member, it will fulfill as many duties as it can," said Hata, newly elected as prime minister April 25. He made the remarks to French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur at a banquet hosted by Balladur. On Japan's bid for the permanent membership, Hata went one step ahead from the stand of the government of Morihiro Hosokawa, his immediate predecessor, which said Japan would discharge as many obligations as it can under a restructured United Nations. Along with Japan, Germany is also expressing hopes of acquiring a permanent east on the Security Council, which currently numbers five nations -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States. A UN working group is discussing how to reform the world body and aims to submit an interim report to the general assembly's regular session beginning in the third week of September. In the meeting with Balladur that lasted for about two hours, Hata asked Balladur to visit Japan and the French premier expressed his wish to travel to Japan. Hata also said Japan will dispatch personnel to a mission of the conference on security and cooperation in Europe to Macedonia, a republic of the war-ravaged former Yugoslavia. The Japanese premier also told Balladur that Japan will consider offering 20 million dollars in loans to Albania, bordering Macedonia. Hata arrived in Paris shortly before noon Wednesday from Rome for talks with French leaders on bilateral and international relations and on the July 8-10 summit of the group of seven economic powers in Naples, Italy. He left Japan on Monday on a six-day journey to Europe for official visits to Italy, France, Germany and Belgium.
