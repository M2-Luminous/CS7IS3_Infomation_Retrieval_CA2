It was not planned either for 28 February or 1 March (this information was available to MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS from the president's press service as this issue was going to print). The rumor about the appearance must have been raised by journalists' speculation which presidential aides Baturin and Satarov did not wish to deny, stating that it was "not far from the truth." In principle, the above aides could have said nothing at all because, as Yeltsin's press service officers stated to MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS, all official communiques about Yeltsin's addresses are supposed to come from it. Well, and -- certainly -- from the president himself.
