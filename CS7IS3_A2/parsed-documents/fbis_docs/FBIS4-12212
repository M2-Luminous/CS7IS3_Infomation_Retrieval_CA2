During a meeting today with Nicolas Rodriguez, under secretary at the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Relations, the prime minister added: Iraq has been done a flagrant and monstrous injustice as a result of the arbitrary anti-Iraq resolutions the UN Security Council passed under U.S. pressures. Nonetheless, Iraq has fully honored its commitments toward these resolutions to remove the pretexts and excuses the United States and Zionism are using to perpetuate the unfair embargo clamped on Iraq, and also to expose the aggressive and malicious intentions of the evil and aggressive powers. The prime minister went on to say: Iraq's steadfastness and the firmness of its unique leadership, represented by his excellency the president, have thwarted the enemies' designs and exposed their positions even at the UN Security Council.

For his part, Nicolas Rodriguez said he hoped that friendly bilateral ties will be promoted. He added that his current visit to Iraq is aimed at holding consultations with Iraqi officials to achieve this objective.
