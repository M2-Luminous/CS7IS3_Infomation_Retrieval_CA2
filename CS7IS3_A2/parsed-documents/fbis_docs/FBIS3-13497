[Peres] Look, I think the best way to conduct negotiations is not by constantly acceding to demands but rather by sitting down together to examine ideas. The problem is not whether to accept the PLO demands. The problem is the degree to which the PLO's proposals are effective. For example, even had an multinational force been stationed in Hebron, it is doubtful that it would have been capable of preventing the catastrophe that took place. Therefore, one has to search for ways to prevent the recurrence of such events. [Zissowitz] Such as the outlawing of the Kakh and Kahana Hay movements, for example? [Peres] That definitely constitutes one measure, but it is not the only one. We are taking the entire issue very seriously, without any connection to the PLO's demands. [Zissowitz] Sir, keeping that in mind, are you disappointed that the PLO has failed to respond to Israel's recent steps, even after these movements have been banned and their most radical activists disarmed and interrogated by the police? [Peres] Look, the word disappointment does not appear in my dictionary. I will be very sorry if the Palestinians continue to put off the resumption of the negotiations, considering that they are pressuring us to meet the timetable, especially with regard to wrapping up the negotiations; however, as the Greek saying goes: No one can tell you how long it takes to walk to town if they do not know when you started or how fast you are walking. [Zissowitz] I understand that the steps recently taken by the government, such as outlawing these movements and interrogating their leaders, were designed to placate Yasir 'Arafat and.... [Peres, interrupting] No. These steps were taken to preclude the recurrence of such catastrophes. We are not engaged in placating anyone. We are dealing with practicalities. We would have taken these steps even if we were not negotiating with 'Arafat. This makes no real difference. These are practical issues, and in this case, I believe it is in the interests of everyone, both Jews and Arabs, that people do not shoot worshipers in the back, be they Jewish or Muslim. [Zissowitz] Mr. Peres, do the disappointing results of yesterday's meetings in Tunis mean that the talks will stop or will the dialogue continue on other tracks? [Peres] I do not think that the dialogue has been broken off. Look, people are a bit confused about the negotiations. Let me explain what is being discussed with regard to each party. With the United States, the PLO is mainly negotiating about the impending Security Council resolution. The United States has a problem. It has promised not to change the status quo with regard to Jerusalem. Moreover, the autonomy agreement stipulates that Jerusalem remains outside of its framework. On the other hand, the United States does not want to torpedo the Security Council's resolutions. The Americans say they are prepared to either support the proposed resolution or abstain on condition that the PLO returns to the talks. In other words, the negotiations between the PLO and the United States center around the Security Council. Personally speaking, I believe that the PLO is giving too much importance to the Security Council resolutions. We have seen that Security Council resolutions have not changed the situation in Bosnia or Angola, Somalia, or here. That is one thing. Now, the PLO and Israel are discussing three separate issues. First is the conclusion of the negotiations on the Gaza Strip and Jericho. We have concluded most of them, and we still need a little bit of time to wrap up the remaining details. [Zissowitz] Will we meet the schedule? [Peres] Look, it depends when we start. Two weeks have already been wasted. That is what I am saying. [Zissowitz] Is there still a possibility of completing the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] redeployment by mid-April? [Peres] That possibility is gradually slipping away because Pesach is almost here. Let us assume that we start negotiating next week. We would only have a very short week, because the Pesach holiday starts in the middle. There are also Muslim holidays. So if we do not start work very soon, more time will be wasted. Israel is telling the Palestinians that the best and most impressive thing that can happen between our two peoples is to transform the mountains of agreements and declarations into a new reality. Constantly making additional declarations will not help. I am convinced that the moment the Palestinians start managing their own affairs, everyone will see a real change in the situation with regard to both Arabs and Jews. [Zissowitz] Do you feel that Yasir 'Arafat is trying to exploit the aftermath of the Hebron massacre in order to try to extort concessions from Israel that we had rejected earlier in Oslo? [Peres] I do not like such expressions, which are more suitable for newspaper headlines. I must use more moderate language. In order to complete the picture, I would merely like to add that there is a third issue: What should be done in the wake of the Hebron massacre? We are not denying that the Hebron massacre brought home the conclusion on the need to take steps. These measures, however, must be logical, effective, and within the framework of our capabilities -- and I am also talking about legal constraints, as we cannot just take arbitrary steps. Therefore, we are asking the Palestinians to sit down together with us in order to discuss the agreement on the Gaza Strip and Jericho, as well as the aftermath of the Hebron massacre. Let us have an open exchange of views. One cannot negotiate by fax or in separate meetings. [Zissowitz] Mr. Foreign Minister, with your permission, I would like to ask you one more small question. After the massacre, Furayh Abu-Middayn, one of the senior PLO officials in the Gaza Strip, was quoted by TIME magazine as saying that if the Palestinian police had been operating at the time of the massacre, the Palestinians would have entered the settlements and killed at least 100 people. We will not sit quietly, he said. [Peres] That is a thuggish statement of which there is no shortage in the Middle East. [Zissowitz] But he is considered one of the most moderate of the PLO leaders. [Peres] I am not talking about the man but about the statement he made. That kind of language is intolerable, and if anyone tries to carry out such actions, he will encounter all the necessary resistance. I suggest that we quote people a bit less. The history of the Middle East is so full of words and so void of actions. Everyone is constantly quoting somebody else. A lot of people in our region tend to go off at the mouth, but they are not the ones who decide things. We need less talk and declarations and more actions to change the reality on the ground. [Zissowitz] Thank you, Foreign Minister Peres. [In a report on an interview on Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 0500 GMT on 15 March, correspondent David Ze'ev reports that Foreign Minister Peres said "he believes Prime Minister Rabin's meeting with President Clinton in Washington will be a push in the right direction with the peace talks" and that "while no agreement was reached in consultations between Israeli officials and PLO leaders in Tunis, the fact that they took place at all is a positive sign."]
