The meeting, which started yesterday, discussed the relationship between the administrative and legislative organs of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the method of forming the first regional government and the method and time for the election of the administrative commissioner and how to form the administrative council and its functions and the establishment of a consultative committee after 1997. Leader of the group said after the meeting that as the British side has shut the doors to talks, the preparatory committee will do solid work and start a new "stove" according to the guidelines of the Basic Law and ensure a smooth transition of power and the long-term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. The committee members urged the Chinese Government to publish as soon as possible the truth of the Sino-British talks and clarify the facts distorted by the white paper published by the British side on Feb. 24. They said that it was merely an illusion for the British Hong Kong authorities to attempt to carry the framework it has arranged over July 1, 1997 deadline.
