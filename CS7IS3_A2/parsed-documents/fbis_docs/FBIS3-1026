During the same period, similar crimes were perpetrated on the Agadez-Arlit road. The unfortunate result of these latest attacks are as follows: one dead, four seriously wounded, more than 1 million CFA francs extorted from the victims, and various goods worth several million CFA francs stolen. Vehicles were seriously damaged and peaceful citizens were harassed and humiliated. Taking stock of this situation, one realizes the numerous crimes perpetrated by the rebels against the people of Tillabery, Tahoua, and Agadez. The ignominious acts the rebels are continuously perpetrating are in line with the objectives of their rebellion which include the revival of ethnic hatred in order to divide Niger our beloved motherland. Though determined to solve this issue through dialogue, the Government of the Republic of Niger will not tolerate these deliberate attacks on goods and on the physical and moral integrity of people. In any case, it will not accept the antinationalist objective that is being pursued. The government hereby calls on all patriotic and active forces of the nation to mobilize themselves so that through cohesion, efforts, and sacrifices the Niger people, in unity, will be able to impede and foil the rebels' attempts at secession.
