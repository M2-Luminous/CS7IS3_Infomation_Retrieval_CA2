"Contemporary economic integration underscores the new role assumed by the private sector, which is actively participating in the formulation of economic and social policies," Chamorro added. The Nicaraguan president spoke at the first session of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias, where the heads of state and government of 20 countries have gathered for two days to examine trade mechanisms and regional development. Private enterprise "should become the engine and strength of our economies," Chamorro reiterated. The Nicaraguan president, who attended the past three Ibero-American summits held since the inception of the regional forum in 1991 in Guadalajara, Mexico, said her administration has proven its integrationist convictions. The many summits organized by the Central American countries have generated a dynamic "that will allow us to resolve the problems that for decades have fostered violence in our region," Chamorro said. The Nicaraguan president pointed out that "Nicaragua has undergone a triple transition process that has allowed it to go from war to peace, from a centralized economy to a social market economy, and from a clearly totalitarian regime to a flourishing democracy." "We have changed ration cards for the exercise of free trade through the private sector," added Chamorro, after asserting that in this development process "we have buried the rifles." The Nicaraguan president admitted that there are inequalities in the countries of the region and urged her Ibero-American colleagues to strengthen their ties of solidarity and mutual support.
