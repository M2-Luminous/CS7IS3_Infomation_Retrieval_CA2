Chernomyrdin has signed documents approving the Nizhniy Novgorod version of land reform as the model for Russia. The Nizhniy Novgorod governor, who was counting on nothing less than a "model for Russia," is to be congratulated. The scientific "curators" from the IMF are also to be congratulated -- this is a rare successful project in Russia. (An American expert told me that he had neglected some more important work just so that he would be able to tell his son: "I was involved in privatization in Russia!") Our own "practical workers and theoreticians" should not be forgotten either -- kolkhoz chairmen and scientists from the Agrarian Institute who had started this work earlier in Rostov and Samara Oblasts but were unable to present it to the public as [Governor] Nemtsov has done with the Americans. The Nizhniy Novgorod option may be welcome to the people and the government because it is mild and does not presuppose "giving anybody a hard time"; it is a model for the natural growth of private farms from collective farms that is calculated, as Allan Bigman, one of the American leaders of the project, said, to take 20 years. Essentially this is a mechanism which regularly "opens doors" to those who want to leave kolkhozes and go into private farming, removes political resistance (the displeasure of the kolkhoz chairman), and overcomes economic resistance (the impossibility of building up a decent-sized plot of land and finding the money to cultivate it). It is curious that people with a variety of views like the Nizhniy Novgorod option -- for instance the famous journalist Yuriy Chernichenko and the famous economist Aleksey Yemelyanov, who recently made opposite assessments of the same events. Mikhail Lapshin, chairman of the Agrarian Party and the "chairman body" that he personifies do not like it, but presumably Chernomyrdin's signature will remove the dissatisfaction. A fly in the ointment: The Nizhniy Novgorod model can easily be profaned. There is a natural law in Russia that the most radical reformist decision can be rehashed by the people implementing it until it reaches its exact antithesis. What could be more "dangerous" than a law giving peasants plots of land as their own property? Yet one or two extra features in the decrees, one or two imperfections in the Russian Federation Committee for Land Resources and Land Management's solemn promises to do everything tomorrow -- and suddenly all the plots of land that have apparently been turned into private property can serve to secure the kolkhoz chairman against any encroachments on his farm. He says: On my farm the people own everything. Yet the majority of peasants do not even suspect that they have ownership rights. The Nizhniy Novgorod model presupposes complex calculations, not always comprehensible to ordinary people, and the honesty of these calculations and land and property auctions can be ensured either by a sincere desire on the part of the kolkhoz chairman to seriously reform, or by careful surveillance by American experts. There are not that many reformer-chairmen, and there will not be enough Americans to go around all the Russian kolkhozes.
