I. Romanov, Applied Geophysics Institute, Moscow; UDC62-756.9.004.6] [Abstract] It is well known that enterprises of the chemical industry emit various gases and vapors, many of which are toxic. In case of an accident the quantity of gaseous emissions may increase many-fold from run-off or fire. As a rule, during any significantly large-scale accident, explosion of a gaseous substance causes formation and dispersion of particles, splinters, bits, pieces, and fragments of the substance itself and the ground leading to contamination of the territory and its surroundings. Furthermore, pieces and particles exceeding a certain minimum size present a danger on impact with the personnel of the enterprise and any nearby inhabitants. It has been observed that during the explosion of bombs or artillery shells having compressed explosives, the mass of the fragments is on the order of one gram or less and their initial velocity is about 10[.sup]3[/] meters per second. Each particle is irregular in shape and represents a macro- or micro-structure of the disintegrated material. Many products of the chemical industry and the storage depots of explosive materials are located underground. Accidental explosions at these points could also be sources of harmful mechanical interaction and pollution. The present work is devoted to an analysis of certain characteristics of the impact of the solid phase of explosive emissions where it has been established that these impacts are one of the most frequently encountered traumatic factors. It was demonstrated that particles of less than 5 mm in radius descend at a rate of 40 meters per second and their maximum energy on colliding with a ground-level object does not exceed one Joule. Impact of such particles with living beings is not dangerous. Larger sized particles, however, could result in trauma of varying severity. Figures 2; references 8: 7 Russian, 1 Western.
