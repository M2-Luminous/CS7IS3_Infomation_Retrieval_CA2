Attenuation of Ethyl Alcohol Intoxication With a 2 Adrenoceptor Antagonists Linnoila, M., Lister, R., Durcan, M. (NIAAA) Serial No. 07/512,835 (DIV of 07/294,119) U.S. Patent No. 5,109,007 issued 28 Apr 92 Licensing Specialist: Arthur J. Cohn A new method of treating ethyl alcohol intoxication through the use of antagonists for the a 2 adrenoceptor has been discovered. Drugs based on these antagonists may have none of the potentially harmful sedative effects of the tranquilizers currently used. a 2 adrenoceptor agonists believed useful for this purpose include: atipamexole, idazoxan, imiloxan, yohimbine, Wyeth WY26703, Chinoin CH38083, Glaxo GR50360A, and Daiichi Seiyaku DG5128. Rapid And Sensitive Test For Detecting Hepatitis A Virus Robertson, B.H., Nainan, O.V., Brown, V.K., Margolis, H.S., Khanna, B. (CDC) Filed 31 Jan 92 Serial No. 07/828,444 (CIP of 07/469,143) Licensing Specialist: Girish C. Barua Diagnostic methods with improved sensitivity and specificity to hepatitis A virus (HAV) are needed. This novel assay can be used to test for general HAV infection as well as to differentiate between HAV genotype I, which is thought to be the most common HAV, and HAV genotype II, which differs genetically from HAV I (as well as HAV type III) by about 15%. Free HAV is removed from stool, environmental samples, and other materials by immunoselection of whole virus using high titer anti-HAV antibodies coated onto a solid phase; viral RNA is then denatured in the presence of primers that recognize all known HAV genotypes and that bind to viral RNA for reverse transcription into cDNA. PRC is used to amplify cDNA with Taq polymerase using either labeled or unlabeled primers, depending on whether information on virus type is desired. This novel method is faster and more specific than currently available assays. Production of Isolated Proteinaceous Materials Using Recombinant Avipox Virus Vectors Falkner, F.G., Dorner, F., Bodemer, W., Scheiflinger, F., Moss, B. (NIAID) Filed 11 May 92 Serial No. 07/882,768 (CIP of 07/734,741, CIP of 07/339,738) Licensing Specialist: Girish C. Barua This invention concerns the use of avipox viruses as vectors for the expression of foreign DNA in animal tissue culture. The viruses are constructed in the same convenient manner as recombinant vaccinia viruses, by recombination of a recombinant plasmid with wild type avipox virus. They have an advantage over vaccinia viruses in not being pathogenic for humans or mammals. The recombinant avipox viruses can, however, infect mammalian cell cultures as well as avian cell cultures. Eukaryotic Expression Vector System Giri, C.P., Ogawa, H., Harris, C.C. (NCI) Filed 22 Mar 93 Serial No. 08/034,652 Licensing Specialist: Carl C. Floyd, Ph.D. The method presented here allows for the enrichment of full length cDNAs of genes selected by their phenotypes. This is achieved by providing a vector system capable of synthesizing sense and antisense RNAs in vitro to generate RNA probes for use in an RNA:RNA hybridization based subtraction method. It also provides such an RNA:RNA hybridization based subtraction method for enrichment of the rare cDNs of interest. This will allow the selection of rare human cDNAs, for example, where limited amounts of cells are available. DNA Sequence Which Acts as a Chromatin Insulator Element To Protect Expressed Genes From Cis-Acting Regulatory Sequences Chung, H.J. Felsenfeld, G. (NIDDK) Filed 7 Apr 93 Serial No. 08/045,266 Licensing Specialist: Carl C. Floyd, Ph.D. Novel method of insulating functional DNA domains introduced into higher eukaryotic cells from the effects of the cell's cis-acting regulatory elements. The invention represents the first pure insulator to be demonstrated to function in human cells. The element promises to be a useful tool in gene therapy, gene transfer techniques, and studies involving gene regulation and other gene expression technologies. Peptide Inhibitors of Protein Tyrosine Kinase_SH2 Interactions Roller, P.P. Burke, T.R., Otaka, A., Nomizu, M. (NCI) Filed 8 Jun 93 Serial No. 08/072,946 Licensing Specialist: Carl C. Floyd, Ph.D. The invention relates to synthetic peptides which are inhibitors of protein-protein interactions, specifically that interaction between a protein having a src homology domain (SH2 domain) and a protein having a phosphorylated tyrosine that is recognized by the SH2 domain. This type of interaction occurs during cellular signal transduction cascades. These cascades are central in the regulation of cellular proliferation and therefore their control is of importance to chemotherapeutic approaches to antitumor therapy. Phosphonoalkyl Phenylalanine Compounds Suitably Protected for Use In Peptide Synthesis Burke, T.R., Smyth, M.S., Lim, B.B. (NCI) Filed 8 Jun 93 Serial No. 08/073,088 Licensing Specialist: Carl C. Floyd, Ph.D.
