Zhang Yishan, vice-representative of China to the commission, said that the reason why so many countries have called for rationalizing the commission's work is that it has deviated from the UN charter's purpose and principles in many cases. Such deviations are not good for the promotion of international cooperation in human rights and the general realization of human rights and basic human freedom, he said. China supports such calls for rationalization, he added. He said it is imperative to eliminate such malpratices and abnormalities such as politicizing human rights issues, employing double standards toward other countries, and using human rights issues as pretexts for interfering in other nations' internal affairs. He said that some countries are extremely self-important and relentless in attacking others for human rights violations while still claiming that they are following the international standards of human rights. He noted that the practice of exerting pressure on some nations by adopting resolutions is absurd and will not truly help improve their human rights records. He pointed out that for some countries, it seems to be their god- given right to accuse others of human rights violations except themselves. He said that this is both anachronistic and unhelpful for the efforts to truly promote human rights. He also asked the commission to fully discuss the issues that concern the developing countries most. He said one of the few achievements of the commission last year is that it recognized the indivisibility of all kinds of human rights, including the right to development and the right to have different economic, culture and social systems.
