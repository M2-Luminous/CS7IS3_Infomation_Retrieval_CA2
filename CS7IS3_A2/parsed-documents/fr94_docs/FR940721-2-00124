FR940721-2-00124 FR940721-2-00071 [Release No. 34&hyph;34390; File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;01] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by New York Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to Approval of Member Organizations in Other Than Partnership or Corporate Form Under Rule 311(f) July 15, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on February 22, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The NYSE is proposing to amend Rule 311(f) as follows, with italics representing the language added: Rule 311 (f) Every member firm shall be a partnership and every member corporation shall be a corporation created or organized under the laws of, and shall maintain its principal place of business in, the United States or any State thereof. The Exchange may, in its discretion, and on such terms and conditions as the Exchange may prescribe, approve as a member organization entities that have characteristics essentially similar to corporations, partnerships, or both. Such entities, and persons associated therewith, shall, upon approval, be fully, formally and effectively subject to the jurisdiction, and to the Constitution and Rules, of the Exchange to the same extent and degree as are any other member organizations and persons associated therewith. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 1. Purpose The Article 1, Section 3 of the NYSE Constitution states that the term ``member organization'' includes a ``member firm'' and ``member corporation.'' A ``member firm'' is defined as a partnership. Recently, the Exchange has received requests from several member organizations to permit them to reorganize as business trusts or limited liability companies. Neither of these organizational structures is currently specifically included in the definition of a member organization. The proposed amendment would enable the Exchange, in its discretion, and on such terms and conditions as the Exchange may prescribe, to approve business trusts, 1 limited liability companies, 2 and other organizational structures as member organizations. However, any such entity would be required to have characteristics essentially similar to corporations or partnerships. 1 The term ``business trust'' is generally used to describe a trust in which the managers are principals, and the shareholders are cestuis que trust. The essential attribute is that property is placed in the hands of trustees who manage and deal with it for the use and benefit of beneficiaries. Black's Law Dictionary 180 (5th ed. 1979). 2 A limited liability company (``LLC'') combines various characteristics of both corporations and partnerships. For example, an LLC is a non-corporate entity under which neither the owners nor those managing the business are personally liable for the entity's obligations, however, the LLC is treated as a pass-through entity for federal income tax purposes. See Robert R. Keating et al., The Limited Liability Company: A Study of the Emerging Entity, 47 Bus. Law. 378 (1992). Noncorporate or partnership entities would have to be structured in such a format that would qualify as a broker or dealer registered with the Commission pursuant to the Act, since this is a prerequisite to becoming an Exchange member organization. The NYSE staff would review each application on a case-by-case basis as it does with all member organization applicants. However, prior to approving any such organization for membership, the staff would have to be satisfied that: (1) the Exchange would legally have appropriate jurisdiction over such an entity; and (2) the permanency of the entity's capital is consistent with that required of other member organizations.
