The country's growth is expected to continue." This was the sensational statement by IMF Director Michel Camdessus. Albania grew by almost 11 percent in 1993, with its program of economic reform, fast privatization especially in agriculture, and the liberalization of trade, prices, and currency exchange. "The agricultural sector grew fastest," IMF Representative in Albania Wei Ding told GAZETA SHQIPTARE. "This branch is also the largest single component in the GNP." [GAZETA SHQIPTARE] What is the GNP in 1993 expected to be in absolute figures? [Wei Ding] It is estimated that it will turn out to be approximately $1.1 billion. On the basis of a population of 3.3 million this corresponds to an average income of about $330 per person in 1993. Construction grew fast at 31.5 percent, transportation at 13 percent, and trade, tourism, and services at 1.5 percent. The 10-percent decline in industrial production has influenced the final total, but it must be borne in mind that the growth of the GNP of a modern economy is not measured solely by manufacturing production. Added value in all forms, i.e. selling for more than you bought, counts as growth. Here, one must also count for example what peasants produce for their own consumption. [GAZETA SHQIPTARE] Will growth continue in 1994? [Wei Ding] Growth will continue. It is planned to be about 8 percent this year. We hope that industrial production will not continue to fall. Thus, Albania may be again be among the countries with the highest growth rates. [GAZETA SHQIPTARE] What work will the IMF do in Albania in 1994? [Wei Ding] Our program is a continuation of last year's. It aims at technical assistance for the government in formulating its medium-term economic reform program. We also aim to mobilize international support for Albania. [GAZETA SHQIPTARE] Inflation is expected to reach 20 percent in 1994. How will this figure affect the revival of the economy and foreign investments? [Wei Ding] Albania's inflation figure was not very high in 1993 either. The figure of 20 percent expected for 1994 indicates economic stability, and will attract foreign investors. They will want their long-term interests to be met, that is to profit from their investments, which they can only do in a stable economy. [GAZETA SHQIPTARE] What do you think of the banking system in Albania? [Wei Ding] In my experience, this is the most difficult sector to reform not only in Albania but in all the countries of the East, because this was the most old-fashioned sector. The banking system in Albania has not been divided into two levels, with the Central Bank and the merchant banks. We would also like there to be private secondary banks that would service various branches of the economy. This would also help the process of bank privatization. [GAZETA SHQIPTARE] Will private banks be opened in Albania? [Wei Ding] In fact you have one private bank, the Italo-Albanian Bank. Its example shows that improvements to this system cannot take place overnight, because they involve the customers, the staff, the management, and the banking infrastructure. Meanwhile, we must decide what will be the best privatization scheme, and work is being done on this in cooperation with the government. There are applications to open private banks from Italy, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, and Malaysia. I hope that Albanians too will have opened private banks by the end of this year. Perhaps some of these currency exchange bureaus will be turned into banks. There are still technical problems, such as the amount of starting capital that Albanian private banks must have. These matters are still under discussion.
