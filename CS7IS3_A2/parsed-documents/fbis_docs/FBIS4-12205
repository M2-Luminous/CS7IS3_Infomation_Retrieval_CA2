For only yesterday, he threatened to impose economic sanctions on the PRC, which is currently enjoying most favored nation status. The reason is not the PRC's rejection of U.S. conditions, foremost among which is accepting the U.S. concept of human rights. We would like to say it again that Clinton's threats against the PRC were prompted neither by human rights issues, nor by the PRC position that the new Korean crisis created by the United States should be resolved peacefully. What then could be the reason? This time, Clinton seeks to reaffirm that he has departed from the realm of common sense and entered the realm of the irrational. He has threatened the PRC, saying that it will be subjected to economic sanctions if does not halt its extermination of a certain species of tigers. Just imagine the waffling president, heir of criminal George Bush, seeking to impose economic sanctions on the PRC just to preserve Chinese tigers that are threatened with extinction. The waffling President Clinton has become too blind to see his own lack of common sense and good reasoning. Nonetheless, when the survival of Chinese tigers is at stake, he too becomes vulnerable. He becomes willing to launch an economic war against China. By contrast, he is unwilling to halt the massacres he helped unleash in Iraq, Palestine, Bosnia-Herzegovina, the former Soviet republics, and elsewhere, in which scores and hundreds of people are killed every day. The reason is that the United States seeks to colonize the world after it has caused catastrophes, tragedies, genocides, and the rape of hundreds of thousands of women. Have you ever heard of such nonsense? We have seen a semblance of waffling President Clinton's kind-heartedness on the face of his envoy Rolf Ekeus when he wept as skillfully as an actor, and then wiped his tears so he could proceed with his work, which is justifying the cold-blooded and heartless genocide targeting Iraqis. Has humanity ever stooped so low? Have we ever seen a hypocrite, a liar, and a double-faced man as waffling President Clinton, who is defending animal rights while butchering and torturing thousands of people every day?
