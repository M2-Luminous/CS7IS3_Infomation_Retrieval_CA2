On behalf of the Ukrainian side the agreement was signed by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko and on behalf of the Japanese side by Japan's ambassador to Ukraine Shoji Suezawa. "This is the first agreement between Japan and independent Ukraine since the establishment of diplomatic relations between our two states in 1992. Japan hopes Ukraine will confidently travel the road of rejecting nuclear weapons and will accede to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as a non nuclear state," Suedzawa stated. Zlenko pointed out that Japan was one of the first countries to have signed such an agreement. In his view, "this document will promote stronger cooperation between our countries. The signing of this agreement is a certain contribution to implementing the trilateral statement by the Ukrainian, U.S. and Russian presidents, signed on 14 January." A UNIAN correspondent has been informed by the Japanese Embassy in Ukraine that the final sum of Japanese aid to eliminate nuclear weapons in Ukraine has not been determined yet.
