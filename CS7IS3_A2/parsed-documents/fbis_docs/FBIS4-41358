He begins by asking listeners to vote for the candidate who spoke the truth irrespective of whether it is convenient or not. He says that he has never changed his views for the sake of personal gain. Speaking about the kind of state he wants to build, Oleksandr Moroz says: "We should build a strong, flourishing, and democratic state in which its citizens will be proud of their citizenship regardless of where they are. This will not be easy, because all the negative things that you are experiencing in your lives are proof of the complexity of the matter. We are talking about the poverty that is being felt today by the majority of the population, the crippled fate of many people, the disrespect on the part of the state toward veterans, pensioners, those who fought in the war, and invalids. I experienced these difficulties over the course of many years and would like to say that the highest officials in the state should care first and foremost for those people who cannot look after themselves." He goes on to say that as regards the others the state should create the right conditions for them to be able to realize their potential. He says that the majority of people do not have this possibility: "This means that the policy of the state's development, which the authorities chose in the last few years, has not completely corresponded to the interests of the people. I would even say that it does not correspond to the interests of the people to an even bigger extent, and undoubtedly this policy must be changed." Speaking on the economy, Oleksandr Moroz said that priority must be given to restructuring and to encouraging enterprises to produce for export as well as to produce goods for the population: "You will agree with me that today such goods are food products." He added that the right infrastructure must also be created. He makes a special appeal to Ukraine's youth, students, and young people in general: "It is not easy for you today. There is an easy temptation to go into business, to make some money, and by doing so to support one's independence economically. It is possible to understand you because the state created no other conditions, but it should create them in order for you to be guaranteed your independence for your entire lives and not only in this difficult stage of transition. This guarantee should be based on new jobs, new labor relations, and on the opportunity to earn a living worthy of you." Moroz says that during his election campaign he has visited many enterprises and organizations and was asked the same question everywhere which was difficult to reply to: "This question is connected with whether there will be work for tomorrow, why are enterprises stopping production, how can one live on such a paltry wage, will apartments be built, will the housing waiting lists be made longer or will they be reduced, will there be social guarantees for free education, labor, health care, cultural achievements, and so on and so forth? People are worried by simple everyday problems and it is difficult for me to give a reply today but the state must reply to these questions because otherwise there will be no trust in the state." Speaking on the Chernobyl problem, Oleksandr Moroz says it is not simply a Ukrainian problem but a problem for the whole world. On nuclear weapons he says: "We gave a unique example to the world of how to solve the problem of civilization. We are the only country in the world, throughout its history, that took specific steps to reduce military security, particularly nuclear security." Concluding his election broadcast on Ukrainian radio, Oleksandr Moroz says: "I hope that those who are still undecided today will not be frightened by my views or by my candidacy. Dear compatriots, what I support today I supported two and even three years ago. What I warned you against has now become reality and you see it around you and in your families. This should elicit fear and some thoughts as to which candidate to support. On 26 June we are not just electing a president. Look at who is fighting for deputies' mandates at the local level, at rayon and oblast councils, and the city of Kiev and why." He adds: "Think before you cast your vote and come without fail to the elections. It is an exceptionally important matter for society. Once again I would like to stress that I believe that we will build a strong Ukrainian state which is respected in the world, but in order to do this we need a joint political will and a desire to work together, an understanding that we are all equal, that we have one motherland and that we can only build it if we build it for all who live here."
