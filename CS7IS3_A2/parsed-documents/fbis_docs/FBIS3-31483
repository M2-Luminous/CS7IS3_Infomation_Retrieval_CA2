The new provision requires that the chairmen of the Supreme Court of Cassation and the Supreme Administrative Court, the prosecutor-general and the director of the National Investigative Service have 14-year service in the legal profession, of which at least five years as judges, prosecutors or investigators. According to jurists, the incumbent prosecutor-general Ivan Tatarchev and Supreme Court Chairman Ivan Grigorov, both of them lawyers, are ineligible for a second term. Thus only people linked to the former Communist Party will qualify for the top positions in the judiciary. Asked by BTA what will become of the lawsuits against the culprits for Bulgaria's economic catastrophe if he is dismissed, Tatarchev said in his view they would sink into oblivion. Supreme Court Chairman Ivan Grigorov said the full recommunization of all areas yesterday hit the judiciary. "God save the non-Communists in Bulgaria," Grigorov added. The new provision was sponsored by Asen Michkovski MP of the New Union for Democracy. Zlatka Ruseva, deputy floor leader of the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), described it as discriminatory and aimed at recommunization. She said the SDS would approach the Constitutional Court with a request to repeal the law. The bill is unlikely to be enacted in the near future, according to MP's, because many points remain to be debated.
