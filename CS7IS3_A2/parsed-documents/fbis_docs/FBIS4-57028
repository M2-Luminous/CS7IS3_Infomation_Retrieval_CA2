[Begin Guatemalan President De Leon Carpio recording] As president of the Republic, as the ombudsman for Human Rights, as a Guatemalan citizen committed solely and exclusively to his country and its people, I once again express my deepest conviction that Guatemala must change. Each step we take to strengthen democracy, reaffirm human rights, fight impunity and corruption, reestablish lost moral values, and regain the credibility of our institutions will allow us to advance in the right direction -- toward our common well-being and comprehensive, complete human dignity. This is one of those steps that will allow us to walk serenely on the road to a comprehensive peace; peace not only as the absence of war, nor as the end of the internal armed conflict which, thank God, is about to end; but peace as an achievement that includes justice and social stability. [end recording] Valladares Molina will have advisory and consultative functions in various government activities. He will also conduct a special project involving tax evasion, and will have to deal with the eradication of corruption in the Customs Department. Cuestas Gomez will be responsible for judicial investigations in order to facilitate the fair administration of justice. [passage omitted]
