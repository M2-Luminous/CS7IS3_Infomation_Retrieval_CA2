FR940613-0-00068 FR940613-0-00015 State tire loading regulations are intended to limit the use of single tires or wheels designed for dual tire applications. This is a practice which results in higher pavement stress and shorter pavement life, and greatly reduces the safety margin provided by dual tires. Depending on the pound-per-inch limit chosen, these regulations may also restrict the use of some ``super single'' tires. The Washington State DOT included in its docket comments a copy of a report of research on the effects of wide based single tires on flexible pavements conducted by the FHWA at our Pavement Testing Facility during 1989 and 1990. Dual 11R22.5 radial tires, previously identified as one of the most common truck tires in use today, were tested against a 425/65R22.5 wide base single tire. Under a load rating methodology established by the United States Tire and Rim Association, the load ratings for the duals and the single are equivalent; however, the footprint on the pavement is significantly different. The approximate footprint of an 11R22.5 tire is 8.5 inches. Thus, two sets of duals (four tires) can result in approximately 34 inches of tire being available to transmit an axle load to the pavement. For the 425/65R22.5 wide base tire, the footprint is approximately 11 inches, which would make approximately 22 inches available to transmit an axle load to the pavement. The research demonstrated that the 425/65R22.5 wide based single tire was significantly more damaging to conventional flexible pavements than the traditional 11R22.5 dual tires. The Federal axle weight limits on the Interstate System were adopted to protect the tremendous Federal investment in that System. Restrictions on the weight a tire may carry, based on its width, are consistent with that goal and not forbidden by Federal law. It would be anomalous to adopt axle weight limits to protect Interstate System pavements and then prevent States from blocking the use of tires so narrow that much of the protection was lost. In addition, a pound-per-inch tire limit does not directly limit the weight that an axle may carry, since additional or wider tires may be utilized. Therefore, unless such restrictions operate so that, as a practical matter, axles cannot be loaded to the Federal weight limits, they are not inconsistent with 23 U.S.C. 127. We believe that laws limiting tire weights as low as 500 pounds per inch width of tire or tread width will allow axles to be loaded to the Federal axle weight limits without particular difficulty. Steering axles must be treated differently, however, since they cannot always be equipped with wider or additional tires. The FHWA has already recognized a different standard for steering axles by not requiring States to allow truckers to load them to 20,000 pounds when the manufacturer's weight rating is less than that. Therefore, States may not impose pound-per-inch restrictions that would reduce the allowed weight of steering axles on the Interstate System to less than 20,000 pounds or the manufacturer's weight rating, whichever is lower. Arizona, Montana, and Oregon also suggested that proposed ยง658.17(f) be amended to allow temporary weight restrictions based on climatic conditions or emergencies. Some northern States have for decades enforced lower axle limits during spring thaw. When moisture in a pavement's sub-base, frozen during the winter months, begins to melt, the load-carrying capacity of the pavement structure is reduced until the moisture drains. The degree of reduction is a function of the overall pavement structure thickness, the type of underlying material, amount of moisture, and depth of frost penetration. Federal weight restrictions apply only to the Interstate System. The standards to which the System has been built include pavement designs developed with the strength to allow maximum legal weights year round. The FHWA does not agree that there is a need to provide regulatory flexibility for climatic conditions. The pavement design parameters of the Interstate System preclude the need for this authority. However, the States do retain the authority to establish such restrictions for highways that are not part of the Interstate System. ``Emergency'' weight restrictions requested by States generally are not restrictions at all, but rather the lessening of restrictions to allow heavier weights. For example, when natural disasters occur, carriers, relief agencies, or States would often like to allow trucks carrying relief supplies to exceed normal weight limits. Federal law simply does not allow waivers of this kind. On the other hand, if a flood or earthquake has seriously weakened a bridge or stretch of pavement, it remains within the police powers of the State or municipality to close or limit access to the facility in order to protect the public. Of the three exceptions to ยง658.17(f) sought by commenters, the FHWA agrees that States should retain the authority to enforce the tire loading restrictions, but does not concur in the request to provide climatic or emergency restrictions. Accordingly, ยง658.17(f), as proposed in the SNPRM, is amended to read as follows: ยง658.17 Weight. * * * * * (f) Except as provided herein, States may not enforce on the Interstate System vehicle weight limits of less than 20,000 pounds on a single axle, 34,000 pounds on a tandem axle, or the weights derived from the Bridge Formula, up to a maximum of 80,000 pounds, including all enforcement tolerances. States may not limit tire loads to less than 500 pounds per inch of tire or tread width, except that such limits may not be applied to tires on the steering axle. States may not limit steering axle weights to less than 20,000 pounds or the axle rating established by the manufacturer, whichever is lower.
