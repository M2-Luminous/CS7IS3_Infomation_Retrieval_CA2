FR941206-0-00060 FR941206-0-00009 DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS 38 CFR Part 3 RIN 2900&hyph;AH02 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 AGENCY: Department of Veterans Affairs. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This document amends the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) adjudication regulations to extend the date concerning limitation of pension benefits for veterans and surviving spouses receiving Medicaid-covered nursing home care. This amendment is necessary to conform the regulations to statutory provisions. EFFECTIVE DATE: This amendment is effective August 10, 1993, the date Pub. L. 103&hyph;66 was signed into law. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lorna Weston, Consultant, Regulations Staff, Compensation and Pension Service, Veterans Benefits Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20420, (202) 273&hyph;7210. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 8003 of Pub. L. 101&hyph;508 required VA to reduce the pension benefits of any veteran having neither spouse nor child who receives Medicaid-covered nursing home care to $90 per month. These statutory provisions expired September 30, 1992. Section 601 of Pub. L. 102&hyph;568 reestablished this requirement, effective until September 30, 1997, and required an identical reduction in death pension payments to surviving spouses having no children who receive Medicaid-covered nursing home care. Section 12005 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, further extends these statutory provisions with respect to both veterans and their surviving spouses until September 30, 1998. VA accordingly hereby amends 38 CFR 3.551(i) to reflect this statutory change. VA is issuing a final rule to amend 38 CFR 3.551(i) to be consistent with the provisions of Pub. L. 103&hyph;66. Because this amendment merely corresponds to the provisions of section 12005 of Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, publication as a proposal for public notice and comment is unnecessary. This regulatory amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities since it merely reflects a statutory amendment.
