Even the human factor (the pilots and the specialists) represent an important heritage that needs to be optimized; this leads to the need to unite the research centers dedicated to in-flight testing, the chemistry of materials, armaments, computers, and aerospace medicine under a single command in the aeronautical research, study, and testing center that is located near the Pratica di Mare base, on the Lazio coast south of Rome. Rather than being a large military unit, the testing center is a complex laboratory where the aircraft and all related systems (including armaments and electronic equipment) are tested before being assigned to the flight divisions. Under certain aspects the Pratica di Mare division can be defined as being the Italian version of the Edwards Air Force Base, because among the 687 military and civilians that work there are also 15 testing pilots whose responsibility it is to test the Air Force aircraft and helicopters in flight, but also those of the other armed forces and government bodies. The in-flight tests are conducted not only on newly-acquired aircraft (the more recent ones are the AMX fighter bomber and the P180 executive twin engine), but also the modifications that experience suggests should be made, and the upgrading during the operating life. The most complex phase definitely concerns the flight tests and prototype approval: thanks to a sophisticated telemetry system, up to 400 parameters ranging from the aerodynamic performance to engine temperature and performance, to the behavior of external loads (bombs, missiles, containers for recognition instruments) are transmitted to the aircraft, processed by a series of computers and displayed on the monitors of the ground stations. Here it is possible to follow the behavior of the aircraft moment after moment, and to intervene, suggesting to the pilot which corrections should eventually be made. One of the most interesting divisions is the laboratory for the chemistry of materials, which courts resort to increasingly for the delicate technical appraisals and investigations following aircraft accidents. The center works closely with the leading Italian universities involed in aerospace research such as the Milan Polytechnic, La Sapienza University of Rome, and the University of Pisa, as well as with companies working in the sector of aeronautical constructions and advanced materials. The studies often have a direct spin-off in the civil sector: this is the case of research into new fuels and lubricants that are of interest to the automotive industry for new generation engines, or into composite materials where it is important to explore the break points with revolutionary methods of investigation, such as laser holography. The most interesting programs underway include the modification of some Tornados into an electronic war version using Texas Instruments antiradar Harm missiles for the suppression of enemy antiaircraft defense, and the testing of defense systems against infrared missiles (attracted by the heat of engine exhaust gases) for possible use on the G-22 twin-engine transport aircraft. An aircraft of this kind belonging to the 46th Pisa Air Brigade was shot down by a SAM-9 Soviet infrared missile during a humanitarian flight to Sarajevo two years ago. The laboratories of the division even determined what the missile was by analyzing a 5-millimeter shell found in the engine exhaust nozzle, thanks to the use of an electronic microscope. An important section is the aeronautical and space medicine division that has focused its studies primarily on stress and immunity and on the problem of the sleep-waking rhythms and the attention levels. This research began with the pilots used on the Tornados during the Gulf War (1991) when the missions began at four o'clock in the morning. The consequent need to rest during the day, at the end of the flight, led to the identification of a drug that lets people sleep at unusual hours without any collateral effects on the organism. This drug can also be taken by students suffering from stress before an exam.
