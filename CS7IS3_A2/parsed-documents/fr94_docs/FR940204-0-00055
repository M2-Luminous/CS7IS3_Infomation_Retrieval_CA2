FR940204-0-00055 FR940204-0-00021 Previous Federal Action Federal government actions for one of these four plants began as a result of section 12 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to prepare a report on those plants considered to be endangered, threatened, or extinct. This report, designated as House Document No. 94&hyph;51, was presented to Congress on January 9, 1975. In the report, Erysimum teretifolium was recommended for threatened status. On July 1, 1975, the Service published a notice in the Federal Register (40 FR 27823) of its acceptance of the report as a petition within the context of section 4(c)(2) (now section 4(b)(3)(A)) of the Act and of the Service's intention thereby to review the status of the plant taxa named within. The Service published an updated notice of review for plants on December 15, 1980 (45 FR 82480). This notice included Erysimum teretifolium as a category 1 candidate (species for which data in the Service's possession are sufficient to support proposals for listing) and Chorizanthe pungens var. pungens as a category 2 candidate (species for which data in the Service's possession indicate listing may be appropriate, but for which additional biological information is needed to support listing). In the September 27, 1985, revised notice of review for plants (50 FR 39526), E. teretifolium was again included as a category 1 candidate, and C. pungens var. pungens as a category 2 candidate. In the February 21, 1990 (55 FR 6184), notice of review for plants, E. teretifolium was retained in category 1 and Chorizanthe pungens var. pungens and Chorizanthe pungens var. hartwegiana in category 2. Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Endangered Species Act, as amended in 1982, requires the Secretary to make findings on certain pending petitions within 12 months of their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 amendments further requires that all petitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated as newly submitted on that date. This was the case for Erysimum teretifolium because the 1975 Smithsonian report was accepted as a petition. In October 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, and 1990, the Service found that the petitioned listing of E. teretifolium was warranted, but that the listing of this species was precluded by other pending proposals of higher priority. On May 16, 1990, the Service received a petition from Steve McCabe, president, and Randall Morgan of the Santa Cruz Chapter of the California Native Plant Society to list Chorizanthe robusta var. hartwegii as endangered. Based on a 90-day finding that the petition presented substantial information indicating that the requested action may be warranted (55 FR 46080), the Service initiated a status review of this taxon. During that time the Service also reviewed the status of Chorizanthe robusta var. robusta. This final rule constitutes the Service's final finding that the listing of C. robusta, inclusive of var. robusta and var. hartwegii, as endangered, is warranted, and that the listing of Erysimum teretifolium as endangered is warranted. On October 24, 1991 (56 FR 55111), the Service published a proposal to list Chorizanthe pungens var. hartwegiana, Chorizanthe pungens var. pungens, Chorizanthe robusta var. hartwegii, Chorizanthe robusta var. robusta, and Erysimum teretifolium as endangered species. That proposal was based, in large part, on the survey information, occurrence data, and information on pending projects that would adversely affect the five plants. C. robusta consisted of varieties hartwegii and robusta at the time of the publication of the proposed rule. Because the two C. robusta varieties, hartwegii and robusta, qualify for endangered status, this rule lists the entire species. Hence this rule lists four plants, yet discusses each of the five varieties separately. The Service now determines C. pungens var. hartwegiana, C. robusta (inclusive of vars. hartwegii and robusta ), and E. teretifolium to be endangered species, and C. pungens var. pungens to be a threatened species, with the publication of this rule. Summary of Comments and Recommendations In the October 24, 1991, proposed rule (56 FR 55111) and associated notifications, all interested parties were requested to submit factual reports or information that might contribute to the development of a final rule. A 60-day comment period closed on December 23, 1991. Appropriate State agencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations, and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. A request for a public hearing was received from Allan Butler of APC International, Inc. On May 15, 1992, and again on May 26, 1992, the Service published notices in the Federal Register (57 FR 20805 and 57 FR 21993) announcing the publication of the proposal, the public hearing, and the reopening of the comment period until July 15, 1992. A notice announcing the publication of the proposal and the public hearing was published in the Santa Cruz Sentinel on May 18, 1992. The Service conducted a hearing on June 4, 1992, at the Santa Cruz County Government Center in Santa Cruz. Testimony was taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Twenty-one parties presented testimony.
