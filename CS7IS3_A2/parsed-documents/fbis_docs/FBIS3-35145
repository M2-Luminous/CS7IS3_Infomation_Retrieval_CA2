He said the foremost concern of the so-called opposition is now an attempt to impose sanctions against Sudan. He added that the meeting in the British House of Commons in which the scattered remnants of the opposition are participating is not of concern. He said the opposition's talk of a war of extermination taking place in the south is completely devoid of truth and that Sudan denies the prejudiced allegations against it. He said what is going in the south at present is fighting between the various factions of the rebellion and that the Sudanese Army is doing its duty to spread security and to preserve the unity of Sudan.
