In the letter, President Izetbegovic thanked Prime Minister Major for his letter of 21 April. I am pleased that the Minister of State Douglas Hogg will visit Sarajevo during the first week of May. We will welcome him and wish him success in his mission. As you suggested, during the visit we can agree on the date and the program of my and my prime minister's visit to London. I also wish to thank you for your message regarding the tragedy of Gorazde and for your government's active role in passing the latest UN and NATO resolutions. These resolutions have considerably alleviated the situation for the tens of thousands of Gorazde citizens but unfortunately peace and safety from Serb attacks are still far away. I am glad to hear that your government shares the view that a peaceful solution to Bosnia-Herzegovina implies the withdrawal of Karadzic's Serbs from the considerable part of the occupied territories. In our view, these are the areas with the majority Muslim and Croatian population before the aggression, President Izetbegovic says in conclusion of his letter to British Prime Minister John Major.
