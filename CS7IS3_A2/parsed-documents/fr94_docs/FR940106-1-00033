FR940106-1-00033 FR940106-1-00008 III.D.10.b. (formerly C.5.) would be revised to clarify what is meant by the outer 2/3 of the chart range. III.D.10.c. (formerly C.14.) would be amended by revising the corrective action. It would no longer require recordation of the ``as found'' and ``as left'' readings, which are meaningless. III.D.11.a., b., and c. (new) would be added as requirements for Electronic Flow Computers (EFCs). The requirements for EFCs would be no more stringent than those for chart recorders. The current static pressure, differential pressure, and temperature would have to be displayed on a continuous basis, and the EFC would be required to have a back-up power source capable of retaining data collected for a minimum of 35 days. III.E.3. and 4. (formerly C.25. and 26.) would be amended to make them read as requirements rather than as descriptions or definitions, as they appear to do in the existing Order. Other editorial changes have been proposed to correct errors in the existing Order and cross-references that must be changed as a result of the proposed reorganization of the Order. The principal authors of this proposed rule are Lonny R. Bagley, Inspection and Enforcement Specialist, Montana State Office, Richard Estabrook, Petroleum Engineer, Ukiah District Office, California, Michael Kolling, Petroleum Engineering Technician, Dickinson District Office, North Dakota, Will Lambert, Petroleum Engineer, Grand Junction District Office, Colorado, and Larry Bray, Petroleum Engineering Technician, Roswell Resource Area Office, New Mexico, assisted by the staff of the Division of Legislation and Regulatory Management, all of the BLM. It is hereby determined that this proposed rule does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, and that no detailed statement pursuant to Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) is required. The Bureau of Land Management has determined that this proposed rule is categorically excluded from further environmental review pursuant to 516 Departmental Manual (DM), Chapter 2, Appendix 1, Item 1.10, and that the proposal would not significantly affect the 10 criteria for exceptions listed in 516 DM 2, Appendix 2. Pursuant to the Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR 1508.4) and environmental policies and procedures of the Department of the Interior, ``categorical exclusions'' means a category of actions that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and that have been found to have no such effect in procedures adopted by a Federal agency and for which neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The Department has determined under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ) that it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities for the same reasons. The rule codifies industry standards that apply to all entities in the industry, regardless of size. The Order would not require a substantial amount of additional information or monitoring. Some additional equipment may be required in certain cases, but the total cost of these changes would not approach the threshold specified in the Executive Order. Costs to the public should not increase at all as a result of the Order. The Department certifies that this proposed rule does not represent a governmental action capable of interference with constitutionally protected property rights. There would be no taking of private property without due process. Failure to abate violations could result in assessments under the Mineral Leasing Act and/or penalties under the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act, and possibly lease cancellation if the failure continues, but not without due process. Therefore, as required by Executive Order 12630, the Department of the Interior has determined that the proposed rule would not cause a taking of private property. The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that this proposed rule meets the applicable standards provided in section 1(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12788. The information collection requirement(s) contained in Part 3160 that relate to this Order have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and assigned clearance number 1004&hyph;0134.

For the reasons stated above, under the authority of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended and supplemented (30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.), the Department proposes to amend part 3160, Group 3100, subchapter C, chapter II of title 43 of the Code of Federal Regulations as set forth below: PART 3160_ONSHORE OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS 1. The authority citation for part 3160 continues to read as follows: Authority: 43 U.S.C. 1733; 30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.; 30 U.S.C. 351&hyph;359; 30 U.S.C. 301&hyph;306; 25 U.S.C. 396; 25 U.S.C. 396a&hyph;396q, 397, 398, 398a&hyph;398e, 399; 43 U.S.C. 1457; see also 40 Op.Atty.Gen. 41; 40 U.S.C. 471 et seq.; 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.; 43 U.S.C. 6508; 30 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.; and 25 U.S.C. 2101 et seq.
