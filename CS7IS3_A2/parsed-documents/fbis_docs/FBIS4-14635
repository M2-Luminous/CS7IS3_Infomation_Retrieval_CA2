They recommend that G-7 countries provide appropriate technical assistance to Ukraine. The delegation visited nuclear power plants at Chernobyl, Zaporozhiye and Rovno and met representatives of the Yuzhno-Ukrainsk and Khmelitsk stations. At a final meeting with officials of the Ukrainian state committee for nuclear energy (Gosatom), Commission members praised the Ukrainian system of personnel training, though the training scheme for operational and maintenance staff was based on outdated methods and instructions worked out while the former Soviet Union still existed. Gosatom deputy head Nur Nigmatulin said that many of the mistakes could be avoided if local nuclear power plants had "full-scale accident simulators", but there was only one simulator, at the Zaporozhiye plant. However, he said the basic training scheme was in many ways superior to its western counterpart. At the same time, Nigmatulin said that Ukraine was soon expected to receive such kits for the Rovno and Yuzhno-Ukrainsk plants, largely due to help from the French government. Twelve instructors will undergo training this year.
