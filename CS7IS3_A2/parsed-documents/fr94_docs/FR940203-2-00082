All workers were separated from the subject firm more than one year prior to the date of the petition. Section 223 of the Act specifies that no certification may apply to any worker whose last separation occurred more than one year before the date of the petition. Consequently, further investigation in this case would serve no purpose, and the investigation has been terminated. Signed at Washington, DC this 25th day of January, 1994. Marvin M. Fooks, Director, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;2421 Filed 2&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;30&hyph;M
