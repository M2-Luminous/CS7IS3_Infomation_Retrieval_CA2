Article 3 1. Children whose parents at the moment of the child's birth were both citizens of both Parties become citizens of both Parties on birth. Before these children reach the age of 18 years their parents may choose for the children citizenship in one of the Parties by renouncing citizenship of the other Party by joint written declaration. If one of the parents has died or been deprived of parental rights before the child reaches the age of 18 years, the other parent keeps the right to choose the citizenship of the child. In both parents acquire the citizenship of both Parties or if their citizenship in both Parties terminates, the citizenship of children who have not reached the age of 18 years changes accordingly. If the citizenship of both parents in one of the Parties terminates and citizenship in the other Party is preserved (the same for both parents), the citizenship of children under the age of 18 years changes accordingly. If one of the parents who is a citizen of both Parties ceases to be a citizen of one of the Parties, citizenship in the Party for children under the age of 18 years is determined by written agreement of the parents. A change in the citizenship of children in the age bracket from 14 to 18 years is done only with their written consent. 2. Upon reaching the age of 18 years a person who is a citizen of both Parties may keep both citizenships or choose citizenship in one of the Parties by renouncing the citizenship of the other Party in a written declaration of renunciation of citizenship offered during the first year after reaching the age of 18 years. 3. The provisions of Points 1 and 2 of the present Article also apply to children where at the moment of the child's birth one parent was a citizen of both Parties and the other parent was a person without citizenship or unknown, as well as to adopted children who acquire citizenship in both Parties or lose this citizenship from the moment of adoption. 4. The declaration of renunciation of citizenship in one of the Parties according to Points 1 and 2 of the present Article is given to an authorized organ of the Party whose citizenship is being terminated. Depending on the place of the child's permanent residence such authorized organs may be internal affairs organs who deal with citizenship matters or a diplomatic office or consular institution of the appropriate Party. Article 4 Persons who are citizens of both Parties terminate citizenship in one of the Parties according to the laws of the Party whose citizenship is being terminated. No professional or other activity by persons who hold citizenship in both Parties can be grounds for terminating citizenship in either of the Parties.
