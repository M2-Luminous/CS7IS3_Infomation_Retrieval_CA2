It is reported that Hong Kong businessman Tsui Tsin-tong has lost HK$20 million [Hong Kong dollars] since he became a partner of the magazine early last year. Lao Chi-san, the magazine's general supervisor of the editorial board, formally informed the staff two days ago of the board of directors' decision that the magazine will "temporarily suspend publication" after its last edition on 1 June. Lao said last night that the magazine was shut down primarily due to its unacceptable financial losses. He believed that the remaining 20 workers will be laid off and paid in accordance with the labor decree, adding that he has no idea whether the boss has another publication plan. The magazine was set up by local literary figure Hu Chu-jen in early 1980's. A total of 280 issues were published despite financial difficulties until early last year, when Tsui invested in it. To expand circulation, the semimonthly was changed into a weekly magazine on 2 April last month, more workers were hired, and more color pages were added. The magazine was changed back into a semimonthly again in November last year to reduce losses. A source close to the magazine said that Tsui openly had said he would invest $HK30 million when he became a partner of the magazine a year ago. The magazine's losses have amounted to HK$20 million. The source added that Tsui had decided to invest in the magazine to keep the business going due to his close relationship with Hu, the founder and the boss at the time, when the magazine was in financial straits a year ago. Tsui was also eager to run the magazine better and increase the circulation so that the magazine would continue to be published as it had been. After failing to increase circulation through increasing investment, changing the semimonthly into a weekly, and altering policy, the management decided to change it back to a semimonthly. The board of directors finally decided to close the magazine because it had incurred losses of HK$1 million a month. The number of workers had increased to 70 or 80 after Tsui's investment, but it had gradually decreased to 20, the source added.
