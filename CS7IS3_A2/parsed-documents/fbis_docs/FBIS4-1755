Mayor Li Qiyan serves as the leader, and Vice Mayors He Luli and Duan Qiang deputy leaders. In his speech, Li Qiyan emphasized the need to have a full understanding of the important significance of family planning, a basic national policy, and the need for the entire party and entire society to make concerted efforts to strengthen overall management and win greater achievements. In carrying out the family planning work in 1993, Beijing made persistent efforts to emancipate the mind, seek truth from facts, and pioneer the way forward and fulfilled the annual population plan and family planning tasks fairly successfully. Compared with 1992, improvement was achieved in leading persons' efforts to attach importance to family planning, in all the family planning cadres' quality and law-enforcement level, and in the masses' awareness in practicing family planning; and propaganda and education, grass- roots management, management according to law, and comprehensive improvement were strengthened. According to the 1993 statistics of various districts and counties, among Beijing's permanent residents, the birth rate declined by 3.43 percent from 1992, and the multiple birth rate declined by 8.2 percent; and their family planning rate was 99.76 percent, one-child rate 94.24 percent, and late childbirth rate 90.42 percent, up 0.01, 0.84, and 0.18 percentage points, respectively. Li Qiyan pointed out in his speech that Beijing's hard-won great achievements in family planning last year should be attributed to the great support provided by central organs and the army units stationed in Beijing, the great efforts of all levels and all departments in the municipality, and the hard work of the comrades in charge of family planning. He said: Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out that practicing family planning will help develop socialist productive forces, enhance overall national strength, and improve living standards. We should fully understand the important significance of population growth control in accelerating socialist modernization and achieving a fairly comfortable life ahead of schedule. While developing the economy, we should bring population growth under strict control. Otherwise, the endeavor of achieving a fairly comfortable life ahead of schedule will be affected. Leaders and the masses have gained an ever-deeper understanding of this, but they nevertheless should enhance understanding. Judging from the current situation, family planning work is still difficult, and some people still have confused and erroneous ideas. Top party and government leaders should regard family planning, a basic national policy, as a major task, intensify investigation and study, strengthen propaganda, conduct ideological education to counter problems, clarify confused ideas, and remove the ideological obstacles to family planning. [passage omitted] Li Qiyan emphasized the need to achieve success in managing the family planning of transients and the people with permanent residence registered in Beijing who work in other localities. He pointed out: This work is the weak link. We should strengthen management and never turn Beijing into the base area for "multiple birth guerrilla forces." He urged: All family planning departments should report family planning work and problems to major party and government leaders on a regular basis. The municipal family planning commission should summarize the situation continuously and give reports to the municipal party committee and government. All departments should conscientiously implement the responsibility system and make sure that arrangements for family planning are made, work is divided and inspected, rewards and punishments are meted out, and criticisms and commendation conducted.
