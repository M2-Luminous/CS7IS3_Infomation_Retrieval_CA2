In this context, we note that the authorities have been carrying out a storming and arrest campaign over the past 24 hours. The campaign encompassed the areas of al-Arz, Sadd al-Bawshariyah, Mayruba, 'Amshit, Jubayl, Jadayil, al-Buwar, Sinn al-Fil, al-'Uqaybah, Juniyah, Zuq Mikha'il, and others. The authorities took the liberty of violating the sanctity of homes in a manner deemed impermissible by law, tradition, the Constitution, and human rights. The Lebanese Forces would like to note a few things. 1. The following persons have been arrested: Sharbil Zena Rahmi, Kamil Khalil, Faris Matta, Zuhayr 'Ubayd, Tony Hanna Basil, George Nakhlah Khalifah, As'ad 'Ubayd, Joseph Anis Rizq; 60-year-old Joseph Faddul, chief of the Bsharrah region in the Phalangist Salvation Committee, and his sons Tony and Fawzi; Sharbil Bulus, Edgar al-Ris, John al-Risa, Isiah 'Utayyiq, Tony Jabbur, 'General Jabbur, Tony Jum'ah, Joseph Jum'ah, Jack Jum'ah, Sahwqi al-Dakkash, Elie al-Ra'i, Rafiq Tawq, and Louis 'Abd-al-Satir. They all belong to the Lebanese Forces or the Phalangist Salvation Committee. 2. Among the stormed homes were the homes of Walid Sulayman, Tony Abu-Yunus, Sharbil Abi-'Aql, Wisam Bulus, Romeo 'Awwad, John Habib, and Tarabayh Rahmi. 3. Despite what is happening, the Lebanese Forces have repeated their call to officials to respect the laws and Constitution and international traditions. They reiterate their confidence that the rule of law and justice must eventually prevail no matter how difficult things might be and regardless of how citizens are targeted, how much partisan activity is restricted, and how democracy and the people's rights are violated.
