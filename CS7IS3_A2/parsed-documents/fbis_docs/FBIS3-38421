Police in the canton St. Gallen announced on Monday [31 January] that the likelihood "has increased considerably" that cesium or rubidium might be on board. However, all water samples taken at the Swiss banks near Altenheim have so far been negative. Rumors have meanwhile been confirmed that two of the five passengers who died in the crash were allegedly involved in illegal deals with radioactive materials. Two German businessmen reportedly acquired an unknown quantity of cesium and rubidium in the Latvian capital Riga in October 1993. They allegedly transported the material to Prague. There Interpol lost track of the dealers. It is not known whether the radioactive substances were really loaded onto the Cessna plane. According to reports, the plane was to stop at Altenheim airport (Switzerland); money for refueling had been transmitted from Prague. Besides the pilot, the plane carried two women -- possibly from the Czech Republic. Authorities believe that the men may also have been involved in the smuggling of women. The businessmen from Berlin, a former owner of a construction company and a sports official of the former German Democratic Republic, apparently wanted to transport radioactive material to France via Switzerland, as was reported. The cause of the crash was still unclear on Monday evening. The pilot made a contact flight because the weather was good. The plane is probably at a depth of 120-180 meters. The Swiss authorities hope to find the wreck with a special German ship in the next few days. A total of 4 million people in Switzerland and Germany up to the Stuttgart area are supplied with drinking water from Lake Constance.
