Avchiyeva, A.Yu. Vinarov, I.A. Kozlova, National Scientific Research Institute of Protein Compound Biosynthesis, Moscow; UDC 576.8.095] [Abstract] Extensive uses of citric acid--an important organic acid for the food, medical, and pharmaceutical industries--due to its low toxicity and easy metabolism and the advantages of glucose in citric acid production by fermentation are noted; moreover, the use of glucose during Aspergillus niger fermentation greatly facilitates research into the patterns of citric acid biosynthesis under continuous fermentation. Today, the Charles Pfizer Inc. and Miles Laboratories Inc. companies, both in the United States, are the largest citric acid producers. Despite considerable successes in the citric acid production methods by periodic fermentation, search is underway for a continuous method utilizing both A. niger and n-paraffins with Candida lipolytica, yet persistent problems of the continuous cultivation method, e.g., a drop in the citric acid concentration in the medium with a transition to continuous operation, prompted a comparative study of the biomass and citric acid biosynthesis by the A. niger culture from glucose under periodic and continuous fermentation. To this end, the A. niger fungus is used. The cultivation procedure is outlined. It is noted that in order to optimize the nutrient medium composition and avoid precipitating heavy metal salts thus eliminating the possibility of using the fungal biomass as a feed additive, the fungus was cultivated in a specially selected water-mineral medium containing glucose as the carbon source. The citric acid biosynthesis yield under these conditions depends on the cell concentration in the medium, the medium dilution rate, and diffusion properties of the culture. The study reveals the possibility of realizing two-stage fermentation: a biomass accumulation stage and induced citric acid excretion stage. The latter is facilitated by dimethylsulfoxide which is continuously added to the medium at the second fermentation stage at a 0.5% concentration. As a result, the citric acid concentration is higher that after conventional two-stage cultivation without induced excretion. The findings make it possible to develop stable and intensive citric acid production. Figures 9; references 13: 7 Russian, 6 Western.
