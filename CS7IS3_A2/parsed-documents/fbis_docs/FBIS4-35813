He said: "I can say that, among other things, there is an assurance in the letter that the Palestinian institutions in the city will not be harmed." However, he declined to disclose the contents of the letter, saying: "This letter was written in such a way as not to be public." In a lengthy interview with AL-NAHAR, he stressed that the Jerusalem committee has not yet been formed because this requires certain measures. He noted, however, that this does not mean that the components of the committee are not operating. He said that he will visit the Gulf countries and Saudi Arabia in the next few days to obtain support for the Jerusalem committee to perform its tasks in the face of the challenges imposed on the Palestinian institutions in Jerusalem by the Israeli Government. When asked if Palestinian President 'Arafat will visit Jerusalem, he said: " I believe that 'Arafat will visit Jerusalem under Palestinians banners." [Arna'ut] A few weeks ago, Israeli Prime Minister Rabin denied that he gave 'Arafat a letter of assurance on Jerusalem, but a few days ago, he affirmed that there was such letter. There is talk about two letters exchanged between the two parties regarding Jerusalem. Is it true that such letters were exchanged? [Al-Husayni] Yes, there is a letter of assurance. Among other things, the letter reassures us about the status of Jerusalem and the institutions there. I do not want to talk further on this issue because this letter was written in such a way as not to be published. But, I can say that, among other things, the letter includes assurances that the institutions in Jerusalem will not be infringed upon. [Arna'ut] So why this Israeli campaign against the national institutions in Jerusalem? [Al-Husayni] I believe that the campaign is partly a reaction to the moves of the Israeli right wing. There is a Palestinian move not only in response to the Israeli statements but to Israeli practical measures. These statements by both parties triggered a very sensitive situation. Rabin seems to be trying to protect his political image before the Israeli right wing and to change some of his stances. When we consider these stances we see that they contravene the nature and spirit of the [Palestinian-Israeli] agreement [as published] [Arna'ut] Did the meetings between you and Israeli Police Minister Moshe Shahal take place on the basis of the letter of assurance? [Al-Husayni] The fact that we said that the talks over the future of Jerusalem can be discussed at a later stage does not mean that the issue of Jerusalem cannot be discussed at present. The talks on the future of Jerusalem were postponed to discuss the situation in Jerusalem and Palestinian-Israeli relations in Jerusalem. We agreed to discuss these issues which were the topics of discussion between me and Shahal. However, these meetings and their effectiveness are affected by the general political atmosphere. If the negotiations in Paris face a crisis, they affect the meetings in Jerusalem. Similarly, a crisis in the negotiations in Cairo and Oslo and the setbacks in implementing the Gaza-Jericho agreement indirectly affect the meetings in Jerusalem. [Arna'ut] Are these meetings continuing? [Al-Husayni] Yes. [Arna'ut] How can Shahal, who is the chairman of the committee on saving Jerusalem, be your counterpart in discussing facilities for the Jerusalem public? [Al-Husayni] I am also the chairman of the Jerusalem committee which is also a committee for saving Jerusalem. [Arna'ut] How? [Al-Husayni] We are both interested in the issue of Jerusalem. The one who speaks for Jerusalem is supposed to be representative of the authorities and not a Palestinian envoy to the Israelis. The official facing us is representative of the Israeli authorities with their good and bad sides and hence we are aware that he has a certain status and a say in matters and he steers this committee. We agreed to hold talks with him to determine the steps that can be taken. [Arna'ut] What is your information on the Israeli committee on saving Jerusalem? [Al-Husayni] This committee was formed by the Israelis because they felt that the time for deciding on the issue of Jerusalem is approaching and so they want to avoid placing this issue on the agenda. Hence, they are trying to take measures to strengthen their position when the negotiating process begins. This is what prompted us to form the Jerusalem committee to demand that the Arab and Islamic world support it, because the Israeli committee is not only supported by Israel but by the whole world. [Arna'ut] Certain Palestinians say that a bylaw was prepared for the Palestinian Jerusalem committee but no practical measures have been taken. [Al-Husayni] We announced that we want to form this committee but have not yet done so because this requires certain procedures. However, this does not mean that the components of the committee are not operating. The Jerusalem committee in the old city is functioning to defend and renovate the buildings in the old city within the means available. When we say the Jerusalem committee we do not mean the major Jerusalem committee with the same resources given to it. We are working to establish an initial budget through which the Jerusalem committee can function and expand its work. We do not mean a major committee whose expenses we cannot afford. [Arna'ut] Does this mean you will kick the ball back into the Arab court to gain support for the Jerusalem committee? [Al-Husayni] Yes. I will visit the Gulf and Saudi Arabia in the next few days to end this matter. [Arna'ut] Has Saudi Arabia extended aid to the Jerusalem committee before? [Al-Husayni] Saudi Arabia has given specific aid, but not to us directly. It provided aid to the PLO to assist some existing institutions and to meet its obligations and needs for the implementation of the agreement. Everybody knows that the PLO needed this aid to begin the implementation of the agreement. [Arna'ut] A few months ago you stated that in the next two years Jerusalem residents must launch a battle to prove that Jerusalem is Arab and Islamic. What measures did the Palestinian side take in this regard? [Al-Husayni] A number of things. The battle of Jerusalem is a political, diplomatic, economic, social, educational, and cultural battle. On the political and diplomatic levels, we are doing our best. This place, the Orient House, is one of the areas that has made a great effort toward that end. I believe that we gained a preliminary presence. This place has turned into a meeting place for the Palestinians with foreigners as well as among the Palestinians themselves to discuss several internal issues. At the economic level, this center has endeavored to call for an economic workshop on Jerusalem, and I believe we must convene such a conference in Jerusalem as soon as possible to send a message to the Israelis that Jerusalem's importance is not just religious. The Israelis must realize that this is the Palestinians' religious, political, economic, and educational capital. Conferences must be held in Jerusalem and funds must be obtained for economic projects, educational seminars, and conferences of this nature so that the Israelis may realize that Jerusalem's fate is not a foregone conclusion. Finally, the Palestinian capabilities, skills, and expertise must be geared toward defending Jerusalem. At the present stage, I believe that we must think of establishing a new college, for instance, to be part of the Jerusalem university and not part of other Palestinian universities. If there is a possibility for renovation or new investments, this must be done in Jerusalem. Jerusalem needs at least 30,000 housing units on an urgent basis to meet its requirements, and this requires more activity than what we are doing now. For this reason, we thought of establishing the Jerusalem committee, which will comprise shadow institutions for all the other institutions existing in Jerusalem. Each department within this committee will follow up the work of its Israeli equivalent to pursue things and put pressure to gain the Palestinian rights in Jerusalem. [Arna'ut] However, the Palestinian institutions are meeting in Ramallah and Bethlehem instead of Jerusalem. [Al-Husayni] This is one of the serious mistakes, where committing them is tantamount to acknowledging a fait accompli, something that we do not wish to do. [Arna'ut] It seems that the Israeli side views the Orient House as the link between the foreign consulates in Jerusalem and the Palestinian authority in Gaza and Jericho? [Al-Husayni] The Orient House had a specific role to play before the agreement was signed and it will continue to play this role. We were offering services to the PLO in Tunis at the political level, and we are ready to offer these services to the Palestinian authority in Gaza and Jericho. [Arna'ut] If the Orient House is transferred, will foreign consulates be opened in Gaza and Jericho? [Al-Husayni] It is very clear that the consulates are present here to represent the Palestinians inside and outside Jerusalem. Thus, under the current situation, it is not enough for them to play their role toward Gaza and Jericho and so they will play their role toward Jerusalem here and then with the authority [sentence as published], and we coordinate with the authority. [Arna'ut] You had your own stand on the Cairo agreement, yet you took part in the meeting held by the leadership to form the Palestinian authority. It was announced that you would be given a ministerial portfolio but this was denied later. Is there any Israeli pressure on the question of the participation of Arabs from Jerusalem in the Palestinian authority? [Al-Husayni] There is not going to be such a portfolio, about Jerusalem. But there are responsibilities in this matter. As to my responsibilities, whether I am in the authority or not, they will be devoted to the Jerusalem issue. [Arna'ut] In the final negotiations on Jerusalem, will you ask Israel to pay the money it has levied from the Palestinians in the city during the years of occupation? [Al-Husayni] Yes. [Arna'ut] That is the arnona [property tax] and taxes? [Al-Husayni] We will ask for the taxes levied on services that have not been given. [Arna'ut] Are you preparing studies and statistics on this issue? [Al-Husayni] Yes. There is a special center for planning and studies. [Arna'ut] Private housing projects are under way in Jerusalem now. But we have not heard about large housing projects by the Palestinian side. Why? [Al-Husayni] Our basic problem is that there are potentially 7,000 building licenses. But building on the land given us is a complicated matter, that is, this land includes common land and some of it is not ready for building upon. I believe that committees should be formed to resolve the problem of these lands. Countries usually confiscate lands in this way. We must conclude an understanding between the owners of these lands and the concerned reconstruction parties in Jerusalem. There must be agreement between the land owners and those concerned and we must find a way to solve the problem of this land. [Arna'ut] Palestinians in Jerusalem are complaining that a services establishment in Jerusalem is encouraging owners to rent their houses to foreigners at the expense of Jerusalem's Palestinians. Has the Jerusalem committee not thought of taking measures against it? [Al-Husayni] I believe that we are not supposed to rush into renting too much to foreign establishments at the expense of the Palestinians. The staff of such an establishment must in fact look for new ways and to contact those who own buildings which are, for example, appropriate to be offices. It is better to let foreign establishments pay to build on the sites that are fit to be office complexes and to leave the houses in Jerusalem. [Arna'ut] Yehuda Olmert said that he will close Orient House. What is your response? [Al-Husayni] He has said so and I believe that what he said does not serve the cause of peace or Israel. [Arna'ut] Do you believe that President 'Arafat will visit Jerusalem? [Al-Husayni]I believe that 'Arafat will visit Jerusalem under the Palestinian flags.
