The West Can Find Jobs for 200,000 Russian Scientists. If Russia Cannot Do It''] [Text] The general mood in many Russian research institutes can probably be characterized as a state of quiet panic. Salaries are held back for months, and the rate is close to the ``zero variant''; the arrival of scientific literature has virtually stopped, there may also be no light or telephone. Every time there is news about the departure of a colleague to work abroad on ``outrageous'' terms, according to our and the Brazilian concept, those left behind fall into even deeper despondency. What is really happening? A recently published study, "Emigration of Scientists From Russia: Today and Tomorrow," by O. A. Ikonnikov (Moscow, 1993, 123 pages, illustrated) strives to answer this question. The study was carried out by order of the Russian Federation Ministry of Science and contains abundant analytical and statistical data on the brain drain problem, and its impact on the Russian scientific potential. We learn that the level of emigration from Russia is not high as yet, even by West European standards. The main form of brain drain is religious-ethnic migration (Germans to Germany, Jews to Israel); nor have so many left for contractual work or to study, according to the fragmentary official data. Thus far, 8.1 percent of all individuals who go to Israel (6.0 percent to the United States, 8.3 to Germany) are scientists and public educators. Perhaps there is nothing to worry about? Nevertheless, there are obvious grounds to take emergency steps on the highest level. What is frightening in today's brain drain from Russia is that it is occurring against a background of mass change from research activities to entrepreneurial, managerial, political activities, loss of job or qualifications. The process will inevitably progress with reduction of State funding of science and obvious difficulties in balancing goals and funds in scientific policy, from the standpoint of priorities. Thus, in 1991, 522,000 people left the field of science and scientific services. But departure abroad of citizens working in this field did not exceed 5,300 people. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

A. Ikonnikov, ``Hypermobility of Scientific Personnel: Problems of Forecasting,'' 1993, No 3, pp 96-107), i.e., excessive movement of scientific personnel when the scientific-technical potential is devastated, confirms the alarm of our scientists and engineers. Is there a chance that decisions adequate to the acuteness of the situation will be made? Alas, only time will tell.
