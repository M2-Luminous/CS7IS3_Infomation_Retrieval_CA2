The crisis in Iran-Britain diplomatic ties assumed a wider dimension when the Iranian Foreign Ministry -- in response to the accusations levelled by certain London officials against Iran -- handed over a protest note to the British charge d'affaires in Tehran, Geoffrey James. In other sharp reactions, the Foreign Ministry's director general for Western Europe, Mr. 'Ali Ahani, and the Iranian charge d'affaires in Britain, Mr. Gholam Reza Ansari, while rejecting Britain's claims in this connection, considered as irresponsible that country's action, which has no evidence. Tehran-London ties have always undergone fluctuations during the 15-year period since the victory of the Islamic revolution in Iran. As the record of these relations indicate, though Iran-Britain ties have been quite widespread on the economic front, such ties on the political dimension and within the diplomatic framework have always been influenced by various factors. Britain's constant siding with the U.S. in countering the Islamic revolution and pursuing policies aimed at isolating Iran on the international scene, as well as Britain's support for Salman Rushdie, the apostate writer of the blasphemous book "The Satanic Verses," are all factors worth pondering in this regard. At present, too, it seems that by resorting to the old tactics in a new shape, under the title of concern over Iran's covert links with the IRA, British officials are trying to (experience) a new cold wave in the two countries' ties. Despite this, political observers believe that, though the outcome of the present crisis in Tehran-London ties is not predictable, it is possible that the London officials' insistence on continuing irresponsible conduct may neutralize the efforts that the two countries have made in opening a new phase in relations since last fall. Tehran officials undoubtedly consider the recent act of British officials as being devoid of any logical justification and unacceptable, because, before reflecting London's concern over Tehran-IRA ties, it is considered as a reflection of Britain's domestic policy considerations and can only please those who want to benefit from the two countries' differences. This is a point not missed by the British press and several analysts have described the recent British act as a tool for justifying its defeat in the Northern Ireland peace talks. According to these analysts, British officials are now trying to link Ireland's republicans to a foreign country in order to deviate public opinion and prepare the ground for the success of the next round of the peace talks.
