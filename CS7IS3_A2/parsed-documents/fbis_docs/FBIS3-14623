A few days ago, three close associates of the leader of this terrorist movement were killed near Medea, some 100 km south of Algiers. Jerome Bastion reports: [Bastion] [passage omitted] We learned today that three close associates of the leader of the GIA were killed by security forces in bushland about 100 km to the south of Algiers, in a region where a secret congress of clandestine Islamic groups was taking place. The congress is said to have discussed the unification of the armed resistance under the banner of the GIA. It was after this meeting that Djamel Zitouni, one of these warlords, was killed, and it seems that it was in retaliation for this blow that the two French nationals were executed on Tuesday evening.
