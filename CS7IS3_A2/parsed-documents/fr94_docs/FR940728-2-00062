FR940728-2-00062 FR940728-2-00046 Superfund Program; Availability of Guidance Document [FRL&hyph;5021&hyph;3] AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Notice of Availability of Guidance Document. Text Section 106(b) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. 9606(b), as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, allows any person who complies with an EPA order issued under section 106(a) of the statute to petition for reimbursement of the reasonable costs incurred in complying with the order, plus interest. Reimbursal is authorized if a petitioner can establish that it was not liable for response costs, or that the Agency's selection of a response action was arbitrary or capricious or otherwise not in accordance with law. The authority to decide whether to grant such petitions has been delegated by the President to the EPA Administrator, and redelegated to EPA's Environmental Appeals Board under EPA Delegation of Authority CERCLA 14&hyph;27 (June 1994). EPA is today announcing the availability of a guidance document, ``Guidance on Procedures for Submitting CERCLA Section 106(b) Petitions and on EPA Review of those Petitions,'' issued by the Environmental Appeals Board on June 9, 1994. This guidance document, which supersedes previous Agency guidance, details both the information a petitioner is expected to submit as part of a petition for reimbursement and the procedures the Board intends to follow in evaluating petitions. This guidance is applicable to all petitions submitted after June 9, 1994, and may also be applied, to the extent practicable, to petitions pending on that date. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For copies of the guidance document or more detailed information on specific aspects of the Section 106(b) program, please contact Stuart Cane Environmental Appeals Board (1103B), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460, (202) 501&hyph;7060. Dated: July 21, 1994. Edward E. Reich, Environmental Appeals Judge. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;18331 Filed 7&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;M
