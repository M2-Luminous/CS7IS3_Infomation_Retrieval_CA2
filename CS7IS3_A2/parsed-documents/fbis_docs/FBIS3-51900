Taking advantage of a news conference held yesterday at PS headquarters, Lewis read a communique explaining the official PS position on the 8 May presidential elections. The PS unsuccessfully tried to forge electoral alliances with the Nationalist Liberal Republican Alliance [Molirena], the Christian Democratic Party [PDC], and the Arnulfista Party, which already have their three-member presidential tickets. Lewis said the party's conciliatory efforts to reach agreements that would serve as a basis for unity and constructive work have been fruitless. According to the Electoral Tribunal, 8 February is the deadline for the political parties to officially announce their candidates. The PS president said that with rare exceptions, resentment, personality conflicts, and the repulsive practice of seeking and proposing alliances to obtain political privileges still prevail in the political parties. The PS announced its proposal "to run independently in the upcoming elections and to appeal to the people and uncommitted political parties to form a grand dignity front to secure an elections victory" to its political organizations. The PS president has not discarded the possibility of an alliance with the National Unity Mission, which is also planning to run alone in the upcoming elections. Solidarity will hold its party convention on 30 January and conventioneers are expected to ratify the presidential ticket proposed by the party's political committee, composed of Lewis, who heads it; Carlos Clement, first vice president; and Marisin Villalaz, second vice president.
