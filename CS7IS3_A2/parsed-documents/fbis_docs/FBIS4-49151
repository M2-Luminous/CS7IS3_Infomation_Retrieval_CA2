The agreement was signed by Huang Qitao, vice-minister of China's State Science and Technology Commission and director general of the National Nuclear Safety Administration (NNSA), and Youki Kawata, director general of the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy under the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
