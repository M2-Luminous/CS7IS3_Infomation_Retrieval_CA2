On 27 January, MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS published an article saying that a meeting took place between Zhirinovskiy and the commanders of several army divisions at a conspiratorial dacha belonging to Russia's external intelligence service, which was being rented by the union's leader Arkadiy Volskiy. The article claims that the conference was of an antipresidential nature. In this connection, the document says, the press service of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs believes it necessary to state that the information given does not correspond with reality and is of a provocative nature. Neither Volskiy nor the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs have rented or are renting any dacha belonging to the external intelligence service, and Zhirinovskiy has never been in the Union's buildings and held any conferences. The document also points to the serious moral and political damage which the publication is inflicting, both on Russia's president and on the union, and says that the leadership of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs is sending the relevant materials to court.
