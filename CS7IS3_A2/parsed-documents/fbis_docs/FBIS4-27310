The sources said the two leaders' talks in Naples will focus on the status of progress in the recently resumed bilateral trade "framework" negotiations, as well as the North Korean nuclear issue. Hata is scheduled to leave Japan on July 7, arriving in Rome later on the same day and then proceeding overland to Naples, the sources said. After Hata and Clinton meet July 8, the two leaders will participate in a G-7 dinner meeting on the same day, they said. The sources said the idea of holding the bilateral summit in Naples was proposed by Washington, but the Japanese side would prefer to have the talks held in another European capital such as London.
