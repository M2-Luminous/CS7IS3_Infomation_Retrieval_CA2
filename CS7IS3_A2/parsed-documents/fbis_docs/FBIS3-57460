INTERFAX has learned that the publication of the newspaper was suspended because it has no money to pay for paper and printing. The situation is explained by the fact that at the end of December the editorial staff took over the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI from the Russian Government. However, the newspaper has not been registered yet and therefore cannot carry out independent financial transactions.
