FR940119-0-00038 FR940119-0-00011 Montana's program revisions include a requirement that conditionally exempt small quantity generators keep records of waste analyses for three years (ARM 16.44.402(2)(d)). This provision is broader in scope than the federal requirement and is not a part of the federally authorized program. Requirements more stringent than those of the federal program are found in ARM 16.44.402(3) and 16.44.109(19). These provisions require annual, rather than biennial, reporting for state generators and treatment, storage, and disposal facilities. More stringent provisions are a part of the federally authorized program. C. Decision I conclude that Montana's application for program revision meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly, Montana is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program as revised. Because the State of Montana and the Environmental Protection Agency may have potential disagreement as to the scope of the State's jurisdiction over certain lands within ``Indian Country'', as defined in 18 U.S.C. 1151, Montana has not requested authorization of its hazardous waste program, as revised, within ``Indian Country'' in Montana. Accordingly, today's decision to grant Montana final hazardous waste authorization, as revised, does not extend to ``Indian Country''. The Environmental Protection Agency retains all hazardous waste authority under RCRA which applies to ``Indian Country'' in Montana. Montana now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders and carrying out other aspects of the RCRA program, subject to the limitation of its revised program application and previously approved authorities. Montana also has primary enforcement responsibilities, although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections under section 3007 of RCRA and to issue orders under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA. Montana has submitted draft applications for the hazardous waste program provisions in clusters non-HSWA V and VI, HSWA I and II, and RCRA I and II. Compliance With Executive Order 12866 The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866. Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to the provisions of 4 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability of certain Federal regulations in favor of Montana's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for handlers of hazardous waste in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.
