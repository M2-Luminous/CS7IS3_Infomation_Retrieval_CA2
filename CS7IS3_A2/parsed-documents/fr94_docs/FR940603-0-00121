FR940603-0-00121 FR940603-0-00029 THE ISSUES AND NCUA BOARD DECISIONS I. Field of Membership Changes To Promote Service to Low-Income Persons A. Comments in General The Board's suggestions for significantly liberalizing field of membership policy to encourage service to low-income persons by any sector of the credit union movement generated a great deal of interest. The first suggestion was to permit credit union chartering and field of membership expansion based on associational groups formed for the sole purpose of making credit union service available to low-income persons, much as is now permitted for existing credit unions seeking to extend service to senior citizens. Nineteen commenters approved of this proposal as a proper method to increase financial services to low-income individuals. However, one association commenter stated that in the case of a low-income credit union, it would oppose a low-income ``association'' seeking to align with such a non low-income credit union if the association's constituents were already eligible for membership in an existing low-income credit union, unless the latter did not object. This commenter asked whether it was NCUA's intent that the individuals of this associational group themselves be low-income or simply have a stated interest in making services available to low-income persons. This commenter also asked what method of income documentation NCUA would require for the association and whether all of the proposed members would have to qualify as low-income or simply a majority. Four commenters opposed this proposal as unnecessary. The Board also requested comment on a proposal to permit occupational, associational, and multiple group federal credit unions to add to their fields of membership communities satisfying the ``low-income credit union'' definition of Part 701.32 of NCUA's Regulations. Thirty commenters approved of this proposal. Most of these commenters believed that it would allow healthy credit unions to help low-income individuals. Two commenters stated that in many cases credit unions are the only financial institutions that are willing to work with low-income individuals in an effort to promote fiscal responsibility. Two commenters believed there was reason to limit this proposal to non-community credit unions. These commenters believed there may be instances when it would be appropriate for a community credit union to serve a non-contiguous low-income community. Furthermore, these commenters suggested that any credit union wishing to serve a low-income group or community should include in its business plan details on how it will serve the group and periodically review how successful its efforts have been. Eight commenters opposed the proposal. Three commenters believed there would be a potential for the credit union to ``cherry pick'' low-income neighborhoods without truly being dedicated to its development. Two commenters suggested that the credit union maintain separate accounting records for the low-income addition, and at a later date, if the low-income addition was successful, it could be spun off and stand on its own. One commenter suggested that ``persons participating in programs to alleviate poverty or distress'' in a designated community also be considered an acceptable group for additions. Five commenters suggested it might be possible to charter new community development credit unions that would immediately operate under the agency's conservatorship policies_perhaps for a minimum period of three years. The commenters also suggested that under NCUA's broad conservatorship powers, NCUA could hire the services of a nearby existing credit union under a management contract to operate the new credit union. One commenter stated that minimum requirements should be instituted for any non-low-income credit unions seeking permission to enter a low-income area to ensure that the community will be adequately served. One commenter suggested that a non low-income credit union be required to provide status reports on its service to such a low-income group. One commenter recommended that no expansion should be granted unless it could be demonstrated that there would be no adverse material impact on existing low-income credit unions in the area, or groups in the process of chartering a low-income credit union. One commenter stated that before an expansion was granted, the federal credit union should be required to perform a study of the credit and depository needs of the low-income group.
