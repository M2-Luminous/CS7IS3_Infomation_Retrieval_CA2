The beginning of the nuclear age was announced by an act of war in the war that the United States neither began nor provoked. It took place at the time when the consequences were not known. The Chernobyl accident took place at the time when the consequences were known. Nevertheless, our subservient state leadership did practically nothing to protect the society against the aftermath of this accident. The crime of public endangerment, which then took place, has not been punished. A journalist must not swallow any bait, nor can he miss any alarming news. The rumors about SS-20 missiles "forgotten" by the occupational power [on Czech territory] are among the things that simply cannot be missed. That is true despite the fact that one must know how to use a flare, or a warhead, and an explosion accidentally triggered by a layman is less likely than by an incompetent manipulation with a hand grenade. The situation was worse when unverifiable rumors referred to a warhead with a chemical warfare agent. It was just the more "poignant" as both the Soviets and Czechoslovakia once promised that they would not keep such warfare agents. Moreover, the treaties in which the USSR and former Czechoslovakia vouch that they will not use bacteriological or virological weapons would make a respectable library. It is not only that they promised not to use the weapons -- they actually promised not to have them. Of course, some disease cultures, bacteria, and viruses are stored and cultivated for scientific reasons, even in the civilian sector. There are, however, long series of treaties and agreements that specify where and how. Under no circumstances, however, at a single location or even a single country. If they have, for instance, smallpox in Stockholm, then they do not have typhoid, which in turn is, let us say, in Milan. These treaties and agreements are also binding for the Czech Republic. Nevertheless, the cultures, and in a form ready for combat use, have been and are here. In our army, completing its transformation and under the leadership of a Christian minister, who should know something about it? Our top brass, as is well known, are founding businesses, consortia, etc. You will find a small civilian business under the name of Klinlab also in the Central Military Hospital building. Similar cultures were brought there from Techonin in eastern Bohemia, where they were cultivated for the Warsaw Pact. They are stored in the Central Military Hospital contrary to all the aforementioned documentation. It is simply a commonplace company, equipped, however, at the expense of the Army, i.e. at the expense of the ordinary taxpayer. All this with the knowledge of the reformed General Nekvasil. Even his economic deputy, Kalousek, knew about it, for he approved the purchase of the equipment for the Klinlab company, which was certainly not cheap. As we have managed to ascertain, the serum banks stored in the Military Hospital building contain gel ready for immediate use. Hence, a catastrophe can be set off by trickling out small pox, bubonic plague, or psitacosis etc., in the subway for instance. An unintentional release could threaten Prague with, at least, the fate of Sverdlovsk (it is now called Ekaterinburg again), where a bacteriological warfare agent was released into the ventilation system of the local "pharmaceuticals factory" and, subsequently, mysterious epidemics broke out in the city. An unknown epidemic pneumonia was the most common cause of death. In the Czech Army, the bacteriological and virological death received the mark PTZD [prisne tajne, zvlastni dulezitost] -- top secret, privileged information. The Central Military Hospital in Prague, in the building of which the Klinlab is located, is a military zone, where the police has no business. At the same time, it is also accessible to hospital visitors on the weekends, and, of course, to outpatients. This means that it is generally accessible. The building itself can even be accessed underground. The building has been visited occasionally by a certain Colonel Zaykov and Mr. Frolov. Colonel Zaykov used to be a KGB attache, while Mr. Frolov was an adviser at the Foreign Trade Ministry. Currently, they both hold valid cards for foreigners with permanent residence here, and engage in business. How about selling these cultures to, let us say, Libya. Let us hope that the appropriate authorities will deal with this case in all seriousness.
