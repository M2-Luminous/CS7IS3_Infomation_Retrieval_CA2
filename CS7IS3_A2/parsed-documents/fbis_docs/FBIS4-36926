Referring to the OPEC oil ministers meeting in Vienna on Wednesday, Aqazadeh told the Persian daily ETTELA'AT that Iran would support every proposal which tended to help boost the prices. He said the meeting has two important topics in its agenda, namely selection of the future secretary general of OPEC, and determination of the OPEC production ceiling. On the former topic, he said there were two candidates from Iran and Venezuela for the post, and that from historical and qualitative points of view iran considered it its to be selected as the next OPEC secretary general. Elsewhere, he said since Iran and Saudi Arabia produce half of the OPEC oil output, adoption of a joint stance by the two countries would certainly help OPEC to make a firm decision. "Experience has shown that the two countries' agreement has had great impact on strengthening the prices," he noted.
