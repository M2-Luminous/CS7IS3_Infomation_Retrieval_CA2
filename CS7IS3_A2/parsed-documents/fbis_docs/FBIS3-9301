The grass is really green; not only narcissi but also pansies are flowering, and the first fruit trees are blossoming. Prague seems to be several weeks behind in this regard. England is--by the way, as always--the real England. The taxis are the same as they were before World War I, and the policemen, too. Respectable gentlemen ride horses early in the morning in Hyde Park near your hotel. You go through precisely the same formalities with John Major in front of No. 10 Downing Street as previously. At dinner in a club with Conservative Party Chairman Norman Fowler, a fire is glowing in a real fireplace (just as in the Rothschild banking house). Quite simply, everything is the way it should be. Only Attali's bank exceeds your expectations because it is even more ostentatious (although in very refined taste) than you had imagined. You again realize that England is and is not Europe. It is the only important European country that is an island. It is proud of the fact that, in the period from 1066 to 1945, it never succumbed to an external onslaught, and it has never lost a war on its own territory. It proceeds from the premise that, in the 18th and 19th centuries, it spread throughout the world the ideas of Locke, Hume, and Adam Smith on individualism, private ownership, a law-governed state, and the market economy, and that these ideas were--and still are--formulated in English, and that, by their intensity, profundity, and ethos, they have left a fundamental mark on today's world. It does not want to abandon these ideas and its indisputable independence, and it is from this angle of vision that it looks at present-day Europe and its unification within the framework of the European Community (or Union). It would be an exaggeration to say that destructive Euroskepticism prevails in England; the British are, on the contrary, constructive Eurorealists, and I have the feeling that we are in the same boat. They believe in European integration; they do not believe so much in European institutions. They do not want a federalist superstate, but this stance is based on something else, something far more profound than rigid and shortighted nationalism. They are, in essence, a unitary state and are watching closely, from this very angle of vision, developments in other European states with regard to today's integrative mechanisms. They are afraid that the Maastricht model will have, paradoxically for its supporters, very strong disintegrative consequences. Apart from the danger of Brussels' bureaucratic centralism, which they are really worried about, they see no less a danger in the gradual disintegration of certain existing European states (they see and hear Catalonia, Lombardy, and their own Scotland; they monitor the Flemings and the Walloons in Belgium, and Bavaria, also) with only one possible outcome--disturbing the status quo and the dawn of a clouded European future. Instead of the European Twelve, several dozen small states may evolve, proceeding more from the concept of the 16th than the 20th century. All of this is important for us, from both the point of view of our incorporation into Europe and that of our domestic territorial arrangement. When I discussed this with Mrs. Margaret Thatcher (this was a couple of hours after the Hungarian foreign minister had proposed in Trieste the cantonal model as a suitable method for the future Central European arrangement), she said "you cannot cantonize the world" and added that it is vital to clarify what the "natural unit of self-determination" is. For her (and for me, too), the nation state is such a unit--that is, not a smaller unit but a larger one. In this sense, the reasoning in the discussion on internal and external integration is in fact concordant. Supporters of regions are supporters of a unionist (if you like, federalist) Europe, while the critics of the excessive regionalization of the small Czech state are, at the same time, critics of the excessive federalization of Europe. English conservatism is, in many ways, close to us, and I think that this feeling is mutual. The successes of the Czech Republic during the past four years are really appreciated very positively there, and the level of mutual understanding is unusually great. When I deliver speeches to the public there (this time in the Royal Institute of International Affairs and the Adam Smith Institute, of which I ceremonially became a member), I have to "sell" our successes, I have to strive for good publicity for our country. At home, we are often, for incomprehensible reasons, criticized for this by our ill-wishers, but I am convinced that, in essence, we are doing so correctly. So as not to make an evaluation myself, I will end this recollection of England with a quote from the influential daily THE GUARDIAN (of 26 February 1994): "Let us imagine that the Czech prime minister takes over the presidency of the European Union and that, at the same time, he becomes involved in a conflict with French farmers, whom he accuses of being spoiled by the state. "The koruna, fully convertible, is attracting extraordinary attention on world stock markets, and the British press, pointing to the further loss of British prestige, is complaining that the Czechs are catching up with us. "Is this a futuristic fantasy? Or is it Europe at the end of this century? "Unless something extremely unpleasant happens in the world, the Czechs have every right to expect that this scenario is very close to reality." We should certainly accept with pleasure this vision of a British journalist, and I believe that each of us is doing, and will do, his utmost to ensure that it is fulfilled as soon as possible.
