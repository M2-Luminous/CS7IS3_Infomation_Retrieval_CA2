The statement, signed by DSU chairman Roman Koval, says, in particular: "The results of the Crimean presidential elections were to be expected: The elected president, Yuriy Meshkov, is a resolute and uncompromising advocate of Crimea's reunification with Russia. His victory became possible not only through the support of Yeltsin and Zhirinovskiy, the Russian fifth column in Crimea, but also because of the weak and indecisive policy of official Kiev. The policy of balancing acts, compromises, and wiles, stems not from the president's stately wisdom, but from his personal human weakness and lack of patriotism. Kravchuk neglected his main duty: The creation of a Ukrainian force that could be relied on to solve important problems. Responsibility for the developments in Crimea also rests with Ukrainian democrats, primarily with the pro-president parties and congresses whose support enabled Kravchuk to pursue his defeatist policy. The Ukrainian leadership is powerless and inefficient. It is incapable of fighting for Ukrainian interests, being accustomed to submitting to foreign will and carrying out decisions taken in Moscow. We call on all political forces to demand Kravchuk's resignation. The Supreme Council must impeach the president even before the March elections.
