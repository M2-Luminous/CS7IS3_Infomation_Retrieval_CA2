It was also done to promote the development of women all over the world, said Chen Muhua, vice-chairwoman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) and president of the All-China Women's Federation. She was answering questions on the white paper entitled "Situation of Chinese Women". "The world has become more concerned about conditions of Chinese women as the world conference on women will be held in Beijing, capital of China, in 1995," she said. Through facts and figures, the white paper reviewed the historic liberation of Chinese women in the course of the new democratic revolution and the socialist revolution under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, as well as their status and role under the socialist system. Chen said that the policy of reform and opening to the world, and the process of building socialist market economy, set a higher demand on Chinese women while bringing their intelligence into full play. Chen called for women all over China to enhance their qualities and to adhere to the slogan of "four selfs" -- self-respect, self-confidence, self-reliance and self-strengthening. She suggested that the government should provide more opportunities for women to engage in administering national, government and social affairs. On the preparation for the world conference, she said China attached great importance to the conference and would do its best to ensure its success. She recalled that an organizing committee was set up in 1992. Its 31 constituent bodies include relevant departments of the State Council, Beijing municipal government and the press. The conference hall has been fixed and all the preparations are under way.
