The minister said the Armed Forces' non-engagement in the antinarcotics fight is due to the fact that "there are the necessary organizations to do it like the Border Police, the Argentine Coast Guard, and the Federal Police." "There are countries in which the armed forces have to intervene because they do not have those security organizations," the minister said. "The Armed Forces categorically reject the possibility of joining antinarcotic efforts, for which they feel neither competent nor inclined." In this regard, he assured that Argentina "does not have the problems of other countries, where drug traffickers make themselves the owners of land areas." Concerning U.S. "pressure" for the military to join the antinarcotics fight, he said: "It is their problem to permanently insist on that fight, just as we insist that they should halt drug consumption among their population." On the other hand, Camilion denied press reports that President Carlos Menem advocates the engagement of the military in domestic intelligence work. The minister said the Armed Forces will only "extend logistical support" in case of domestic disturbances, like the one that occurred in December in Santiago del Estero, although he admitted that government members followed this specific case with "concern." Camilion maintained that the government "has no intention" of making the Armed Forces join domestic intelligence work, adding that he received "neither formally nor informally, neither directly nor indirectly," any indication in this regard from President Menem or Presidency Secretary General Eduardo Bauza. In statements to journalists after opening the academic year of the School of National Defense, which is subordinated to his portfolio, Camilion recalled that the Armed Forces are ruled by defense and internal security laws, and he categorically denied that the "amendment" of such laws is being studied. He also categorically denied that the United States has made any reference to the possibility of the military taking action in case of an eventual social outbreak in Argentina. He added he was not concerned about the stay in Chile of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, denying that a military power imbalance can be caused in the region in case of the possible purchase of military equipment by the Chilean Government. "We would only be concerned about Chilean purchases of British weapons if Chile were insinuating the possibility of creating a power imbalance in the region; but the truth is that we have just arrived from Chile, and we have not seen anything that might cause concern in this regard," the minister added. Concerning the statement by Thatcher in Chile, Camilion emphatically rejected the remarks by the former British prime minister that the Malvinas islands war facilitated the return of democracy in Argentina. In this regard, he said: "Both Argentina and all of Latin America have a strongly democratic tradition."
