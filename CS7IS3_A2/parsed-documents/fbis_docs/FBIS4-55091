"But it asks these families not to allow that their economic problems and demands be manipulated by those who have been the real authors of their drama and who are now pouring crocodile tears." It says that the blocking of the roads and occupation of state buildings are acts which only intend to give political colour to the just economic demands of the removed families. Also, it asks the representatives of these families and strikers to define the ways of solving these demands through dialogue with the government and in a constructive spirit. It also asks the government to adopt all measures to accelerate the drafting and application of the aid program for the removed families and solve their problems, the statement concludes.
