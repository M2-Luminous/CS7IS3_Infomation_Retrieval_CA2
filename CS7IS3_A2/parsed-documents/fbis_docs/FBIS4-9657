[Baja California], 27 Mar -- Before dawn on 27 March, the Attorney General's Office [PGR] arrested Tranquilino Sanchez Vega, an aide to General Domiro Garcia Reyes, whom the Presidential Staff put in charge of the security around Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta. Sanchez has been interrogated since early morning on his presumed complicity in the attack that left the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] presidential candidate dead. The revealing pictures of Robert Gauthier, a news photographer for THE SAN DIEGO UNION, changed the course of the investigations, after the PGR reported through its chief, Diego Valades, that only one person had fired at the PRI presidential candidate. In one of the pictures taken minutes before the attack in Lomas Taurinas and published by Associated Press (AP), we can see when Sanchez, wearing a dark leather jacket and cap with a badge in front, extends his right arm toward the candidate and reaches over the shoulder of Colosio, who has his back to Sanchez. The release of these pictures and statements by doctors, specialists, policemen, and authorities who are close to the case, as well as statements residents gave to EL UNIVERSAL, support the possibility that Luis Colosio may have been murdered as a victim of a plot possibly involving members of his security staff. Sources who were questioned said that "at least three persons shot at Luis Colosio." The first shot came from Colosio's left side; the second one, which hit Colosio in the abdomen, from his right side; and the third one --apparently shot by Mario Aburto Martinez -- was fired at the candidate's head as he was falling to the ground. Everything seems to indicate that the three shots were fired simultaneously and that the assassins were within the security ring around the candidate, which is a usual practice in every presidential tour. It was said that there were snipers around. The report on the plot to assassinate the candidate was corroborated by the alleged involvement of individuals responsible for Colosio's security, as well as by big logistical mistakes made during his tour to Tijuana. Last-minute changes in the schedule and adjustments to the podium from which Colosio would speak in Lomas Taurinas attributed to the General Staff make us think that the PRI candidate was not murdered by one person alone, as the PGR stated. Sources close to the PGR spoke about the commotion caused by the pictures taken by the San Diego reporter. Said pictures were immediately taken to PGR authorities in this city. One of these pictures, published in the 25 March issue of THE SAN DIEGO UNION, shows the PRI presidential candidate, and to his right is Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela, former judicial agent, whom the PGR arrested immediately after the assassination. The PGR later announced that it would set him free "as the law stipulates." One of his two children, who were part of Colosio's security team, is next to Mayoral. A few steps behind Colosio (in the same picture), we can see assassin Mario Aburto Martinez, and right next to him we can see a tall and muscular individual who is wearing a dark leather jacket and a cap with a badge on the front. He was later identified as Tranquilino Sanchez Vega. On his left arm, he is wearing an band with Colosio's name on it. Staff Gen. Garcia Reyes is right next to him. The second picture clearly shows how both individuals (Aburto Martinez and Sanchez Vega) advance until Aburto positions himself on the right-hand side of the candidate and Sanchez Vega is behind the alleged killer, with the right hand (of Sanchez Vega) pointing towards the abdomen of the candidate. He remains standing next to a stocky individual, the staff general, who, according to eyewitnesses, was always accompanied by Tranquilino Sanchez. Members of the security corps who were hired by the PRI Municipal Direction Committee in Tijuana to guard the candidate said Gen. Domiro Garcia Reyes, together with Tranquilino Sanchez Vega, ordered them to remove the white band bearing Colosio's name from their arms, which they had decided to wear to identify themselves. In THE SAN DIEGO UNION photograph, it can be seen that Tranquilino Sanchez, who was captured early this morning, wore the aforementioned band, without Domiro Garcia Reyes asking him to remove it, as he had done with the rest of the security agents. Without going into great detail, Humberto Sanoja Morrell, one of those in charge of the security group under the municipal PRI, confirmed to EL UNIVERSAL that they had been ordered to remove the band and leave the area "because the candidate did not like security." Sanoja Morrell affirmed that both he and Rodolfo Rivapalacio, who coordinated the group of security agents, had gathered some 125 agents to form a barrier guarding the candidate's path, but insisted they were ordered to leave the area. Sanoja Morrell denied the PRI hired these security people (including former State Judicial Police agents) because most of them volunteered to participate in the campaign, as is customary during electoral campaigns. He denied knowing Tranquilino Sanchez Vega and said he was not a member of the security staff (local security). Meanwhile, sources we talked with told us that Colosio was taken to Lomas Taurinas without heeding the warning that it was one of the most dangerous parts of town, not only because of the high crime rate but because security conditions could not be guaranteed there. They revealed the PRI decided to set up the speaker's stand in front of an enormous wall painted with the word Colosio "that would serve as protection for the PRI candidate, but because of an order by the Presidential staff that accompanied him, the stand was set up above the wall, on the hill, leaving Colosio absolutely unprotected. [no closing quotation marks as published] Eglantina Esquivel de Abad, a PRI member who publishes a bulletin in Tijuana, said in an interview with this newspaper that they apparently tried to assassinate the candidate when he addressed the crowd, but the presence of children next to Colosio prevented this from happening. Eglantina said she saw when Aburto Martinez arrived at the crime scene, accompanied by Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela, former head of homicide of Judicial Police in Tijuana. She explained that both Mayoral and a tall and robust man (seemingly Sanchez Vega) always accompanied Aburto Martinez. "When Colosio spoke they appeared nervous, as if they were preparing themselves to do something bad, but since they were unable to attack him at that moment, they began to follow him and always had direct access to the candidate," Eglantina noted. After the attack took place, she burst into tears hysterically accusing Mayoral of being one of the assassins. The interviewee asserted that a PGR official sought her afterward to notify her she would have to appear before the PGR "because my testimony would be very valuable. I refused, however, because I did not know if he was really an official or they were trying to shut me up because I was a witness." Eglantina affirmed that she later went to the PGR office accompanied by her two sons and a state police agent she had known for a long time, "but once I arrived there, they just kept me isolated in an office until 0200 on Thursday, because no one ever interrogated me." Apparently, Eglantina Esquivel conceded, "what they were trying to do was to keep my mouth shut because I had seen who attacked the candidate." She insisted she was never questioned in connection with the assassination. Eglantina referred to the way in which the candidate was evacuated from the area, as well as the cragginess of the terrain, which made it impossible to think of a quick exit in case of an emergency. Sources we consulted, who have participated in logistical tasks in previous presidential campaigns, said "no person responsible for the security of a candidate should have ever allowed a rally to be held in such place as Lomas Taurinas." Local PRI figured emphasized that "in this case, apparently there was strong interest by the organizers of Colosio's campaign that he appear there." They explained that Jaime Martinez Veloz, Solidarity deputy delegate, was tasked with organizing the event at the request of Mario Luis Fuentes, former general director of Solidarity and current social participation coordinator of the Colosio campaign. Both officials have worked closely with former Public Education Secretary Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon. PRI members themselves have revealed that fellow members from Baja California are outraged by the fact that Zedillo Ponce de Leon, despite being originally from that area and PRI campaign manager, was not in Baja California, arguing that he wanted to avoid any speculation regarding his possible candidacy to the Baja California Government. PRI militants who were interviewed and who insisted on pointing out other reasons justifing that Zedillo did not accompany Colosio in his native state, added: "For heaven's sake, no one is more qualified to represent the PRI in our state than Zedillo." Logistics experts have also pointed out the lack of a mechanism of immediate attention to the candidate: "In the middle of a campaign, those in charge of logistics are the first to visit the states the candidate is scheduled to visit, and makes arrangements with a hospital so that it will be prepared to offer its services in case of an emergency. In addition to this, blood for the candidate (particularly, in Colosio's case because his blood type was considered uncommon) and a Mexican Social Security Institute [IMSS] ambulance are taken along during the entire political tour. On this occasion, both of these aspects were ignored. The candidate was taken to the General Hospital, a Health Secretariat institution that lacked medical equipment and instruments, and donors were solicited because blood was not available. They note that no IMSS ambulance or any other hospital was available at the incident's site so at first, he had to be put in a suburban van to be moved later to a Delta-7 rescue unit, which lacked the equipment needed to attend to the emergency. Policemen questioned confirm that Colosio was taken to the General Hospital the long way -- it took 20 minutes -- when he could have been taken to IMSS Clinic 20, which would have been taken at most five minutes. An expert in providing security services to prominent persons from California State was questioned about all of this, and when he took a look at the second photo taken by the reporter from San Diego, he categorically said that: "I hope this man (Sanchez Vega) forgives me, but he is getting ready to shoot in this phote. I believe he was one of the men who shot Colosio in the abdomen." He emphasized the way in which Sanchez Vega keeps his arm above Colosio's shoulder, and stated that "that is a shooting position, and therefore, this situation must be clarified by Mexican federal authorities." Another one of Gauthier's photographs, which shows Colosio lying on his stomach, destroys the PGR argument claiming that Colosio Murrieta was shot by one person, with an initial shot to the head as stated by Attorney General Diego Valadez. Valadez said that when Colosio had walked a distance of approximately 10 meters in the crowd, Mario Aburto Martinez, the presumed perpetrator, who was on Colosio's right, drew a revolver, placed it to Colosio's right temple and pulled the trigger, mortally wounding Colosio. "When he was shot in his right temple, with an exit hole in the corresponding left temple, the victim turned around counterclockwise, and while he was falling down, the attacker pulled the trigger again to produce a second wound in the abdominal area, where the bullet entered through the hypogastrium and exited in the region of the right hypochondrium." Guillermo Castorena and Alvaro Garcia Taxilaga, Colosio's doctors, signed an initial report establishing that Colosio received two bullet wounds: one in the region of the skull entering through the right temporal bone and exiting through the left parietal bone. Other doctors who were consulted said the said report indicates that Colosio was shot in the skull; the bullet entered the right temple and exited "through the small bone located above the left temple." Meanwhile, the second shot was in the abdomen, entering below his left rib and exiting in the region of the right rib. Doctors who performed surgery on the PRI presidential candidate gave EL UNIVERSAL assurances that the body of the unfortunate man apparently received three shots from three different weapons: two apparently .38-caliber specials and one of apparently smaller caliber, perhaps .22 or .25-caliber. This coincides with the innocent remarks made on a radio station by renown Tijuana cardiologist Patricia Aubanel Riedel, whose past successes include "open heart" surgery on Nobel peace prize winner Mother Theresa of Calcutta. During an interview on XEC Radio the day after Colosio's death, the cardiologist told commentator Jesus Arnoldo Lopez Salcido: "He received two different shots; one of them, which entered on the right side of the brain in the area of the temple, came from a .38-caliber revolver; the other, from a .22-caliber revolver, apparently entered the left side of his abdomen in the sub-thoraxic area, which led the team of doctors to believe that there had been two shots." The commentator asked the doctor if she meant that two different weapons had been used, to which she answered: "This is what we thought (the doctors who saw Colosio's body) and those are our observations (while we were treating the candidate), although we have not yet read the legal expert's report. It is our assumption." Later, in response to the commentator's insistence on finding out if two persons fired at the candidate, Aubanel Riedel answered: "Yes, I believe so. The reports will establish that." The reports did not mention it, however. Instead, they presented a totally different picture: one weapon, a Brazilian-made "Taurus" .38 special fired by one man, Mario Aburto Martinez, 23. Confidential reports provided to EL UNIVERSAL reveal that Dr. Aubanel Riedel's statements greatly upset Attorney General Diego Valadez, who issued instructions to "fix that." During subsequent interviews Dr. Aubanel attempted to recant what she had said but there is a recording of the interview. Coincidentally, Doctor Rosalina Guerra, director of the General Hospital (where the late PRI candidate was treated), on the same evening (of Dr. Aubanel's interview) also made statements on a local television newscast. Dr. Guerra answered, among others, a very specific question: Could the doctors establish whether the wounds were caused by a certain weapon. Guerra categorically denied this possibility, adding: "Doctors can only determine the caliber of the weapon." We asked doctors on both sides of the border (Tijuana and San Diego) about this and they said, virtually without even thinking: "Of course; we can determine perfectly well if the wounds were caused by guns of different caliber, but we always prefer to wait for confirmation by experts." Another of the doctors who treated Luis Donaldo Colosio in the operating room, shocked by his death, complained of "how filthy all of this was" and asserted that the candidate had not been shot twice but three times. Hospital personnel who by reason of their profession were able to get close to the operating room, confirmed this and even gave assurances that "very strange things happened; for example, members of the Presidential General Staff did not allow doctors from Mexico City to treat the patient or to enter the operating room while he was still alive." The personnel in question said an altercation took place between Presidential General Staff members and representatives from the PGR over this situation, but the latter prevailed because they said they were in charge of the situation. As a result, only local specialists and doctors treated the candidate. Eleven doctors treated Colosio and "none of them were from Mexico City; all of them were local doctors," insisted a source who added that two autopsies were conducted on the candidate's body: one by the Tijuana Forensic Medicine Service (Semefo) by Doctors Gustavo Salazar and Esteban Chapital, and another by Federal District doctors accompanied by members of the Federal Judicial Police. Criminologists, who were asked about how Colosio was wounded, said it is improbable his body would have acted the way the attorney general said had the first shot been to the head. They said that definitely, the shots to the lower part of his body must have been fired first because there are reports that Colosio put his hands on his abdomen and he would not have been able to do that had the first shot been to his brain. Some policemen have explained: "If you want to kill someone you bring him down first and then you finish him off with a shot to the head." The policemen noted that considering the height of the victim and that of the killer, it appears impossible Colosio could have received the wounds officially reported. The policemen noted: "Have you seen how bulls tumble when they are dealt the coup de grace with a dagger? This is how Colosio would have dropped had the first shot been to the head." They went on: "The body goes limp and flabby and the arms fall to the side of the body." Anibal Colosio, a cousin of the late candidate who was at the site, said that immediately after the attack, he saw Colosio fall "to his knees." According to some people, Colosio placed his hands on his abdomen. Others claim they heard at least three shots. This apparently is confirmed by a picture taken by Gauthier. The picture shows Colosio's position when he fell. It shows his back and his hands as if trying to grab his stomach at the time some people try to put him on his back. The people interviewed explained that this shows that Colosio was finished off with a shot to the head and this has moved the PGR to redouble its efforts. It became known this morning that Attorney General Diego Valadez and his closest aides have traveled to Tijuana again. Finally, with regard to the discovery of a video showing the moment Aburto places the gun near the candidate's head, consulted experts have mentioned the possibility of a photographic gimmick. These experts pointed to the darkness of the video and recalled that the attack took place shortly after 1700, when it was still daylight. They affirmed that the picture is so nebulous that a photomontage gimmick is conceivable. The same experts also pointed out the position of the killer's hand noting that "considering the way the revolver was raised and its height, it had to be noticed by security people, who in the face of such a situation would have killed the aggressor before he could have taken aim." As policemen, the experts said, we think this film could have been "fixed" in the evening. This fits reports received by EL UNIVERSAL the night of the attack. Those reports speak of members of the military staff reconstructing the events. The people of Lomas Taurinas asked reporters: "What is the use of doing that now?" This newspaper has been informed of another noteworthy thing: Alleged federal agents reportedly from Sonora State, videotaped absolutely everything having to do with the PRI candidate. Sources close to the PGR have also reported that "on the night of the crime," Attorney General Diego Valadez "saw the video over and over." Regarding what happened to the arrested man the day of the crime, EL UNIVERSAL has been informed that (after the people tried to lynch him) he was placed in a suburban van occupied by at least 10 other persons. The commander of Tijuana's Municipal Tactical Group tried to prevent them from taking Aburto away because the people were afraid Aburto would be killed. One of the people in the van, however, identified himself as member of the military staff and the van was allowed to drive away. People who were close to the van when the rifle-wielding commander of the tactical group stopped it, have reported that this police chief told the people in the van: "I will let you keep going, but I want this man alive when he gets to the Attorney General's Office."
