FR940906-0-00035 FR940906-0-00017 Issue 4: Several commenters maintain that habitat problems should be addressed through existing regulatory processes and not through the Federal listing process. For example, Direct Services Industries, Inc. stated that the ``*␣*␣*␣USFWS has incorrectly determined that existing regulatory mechanisms are inadequate to assure conservation and recovery of the sturgeon and promote recovery of its purportedly declining population.'' They and other respondents also believe that operations at Libby Dam have not been modified to date because the biological needs and requirements of white sturgeon are not currently known. The IDFG also believes that recovery of the sturgeon population is still achievable without listing under the Act if the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) would modify Kootenai River flow management to benefit sturgeon recruitment and survival. Service response: The Service believes that, although the lack of reproduction and successful recruitment is the most immediate threat to the sturgeon population, other factors are also contributing to their decline. In recent years, efforts by various State agencies and the Kootenai Tribe, authorized by the Northwest Power Planning Council (NWPPC) (1987) and funded by BPA, have been undertaken to identify all environmental factors limiting the white sturgeon population in the Kootenai River. Additionally, the Corps and BPA have committed to providing experimental flows releases from Libby Dam for sturgeon. For example, 400,000 acre-feet of water was released from Libby Dam during May and June 1993 as a test to stimulate sturgeon spawning. However, the experiment was intended only to evaluate possible spawning flow thresholds, not to provide flow or habitat conditions necessary for survival beyond the egg stage throughout the spawning season. The Corps and BPA, in conjunction with the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), have also developed a flow proposal starting in 1994 based on results of the 1993 experimental flow and water availability in an effort to provide for spawning and recruitment of Kootenai River white sturgeon. The flow proposal includes provisions to ``shape'' flows from Libby Dam to achieve the ``desired'' sturgeon flows in 3 out of every 10 years, dependent upon flow forecasts (water availability), and only to the extent that flows will not reduce refill or violate flood control requirements (Corps 1993). Despite this flow proposal and cooperative monitoring efforts to better comprehend the factors affecting the Kootenai River white sturgeon, there is no long-term commitment to modify dam operations and manage stored water at other times of the year to ensure that sturgeon flows are provided starting in 1994 or other early years of the 10 year cycle. The Corps and BPA continue to prioritize Libby Dam operations to meet other demands, primarily hydropower and recreation, and not for the benefit of Kootenai River white sturgeon or other resident fishes.
