Many countries around the world are having fits of ecological irresponsibility. The extraction of gold, silver, diamonds, rare metals, timber, oil, gas and coal is comparable, in terms of the effects of its merciless haste, only with the effects of the Ice Age. Fertile soils are being impoverished. But the thing that is most tragic in its unnoticed frequency is the increasing absence of living water. Water is dying. And the death of water turned this seminar into a lecture/interview with Russian Academy of Sciences member Boris Nikolayevich Laskorin, chairman of the Russian Academy of Sciences Commission on the Protection of Natural Waters. Laskorin: It is hard to believe that, of all the other natural resources, it is water that is being subjected to cruel and harmful effects on the largest scale. Today it seems that it is only being protected in wells. Yet it is being recklessly poisoned in rivers, in lakes and even in the seas. There are many sad examples of this in countries around the world. It is embarrassing to talk about the Aral Sea -- it is dying. The rivers of Europe and America are being mercilessly polluted from source to mouth, and our own Volga River and the limitless Siberian rivers are no exception. True, there is no way to cover up individual disasters -- massive discharges of industrial waste or fecal sludge. Condemnations are issued and resolutions adopted -- urgent in name, indefinite in implementation. There have been cases not only of bans on drinking the polluted liquid, but even swimming in it. But as for the day-to-day, implacable degradation of water's living qualities, it is not merely forgotten -- no one even notices it. But the time has come to protect living water as if it were our greatest treasure. And to begin using it efficiently and conservatively at home and in industry. Otherwise no amount of doctors or pharmacies will be able to help us. True, traditionally Moscow's water supply has been among the most drinkable as measured by world standards. The water supplied to the city is fully in compliance with public health and technical standards and not only meets but in several cases actually exceeds the quality of aqueous "raw material" in many large cities in Europe and America. However, I should note that the standard in use around the world includes only a few requirements, and excessively general ones at that, regarding the quality of water sources for all uses. Thus far nowhere do we find clear definitions, and hence no implementation, of standards for two basic concepts: household water, consumed for purely natural needs -- washing people and clothes, washing dishes, etc. -- and drinking water, i.e. water that is suitable for internal consumption. Furthermore, at this point there is no clear definition of what is "drinkable," nor are there any clear-cut standards and criteria, and therefore the concept is sometimes interpreted in a rather arbitrary fashion, depending on views, needs, funding, etc. I am convinced that the time has come to commence objective definition of standards and creation of an appropriate state standard for drinking water -- water that is, I reiterate, for internal consumption. Whereas in Moscow total household water consumption is 500-550 liters per capita per day, drinking water consumption is only 2-3 liters. It is clear that that much consumption does not require a separate water supply. In order to ensure the necessary degree of purification, particularly under emergency conditions, I would recommend home installations, well, not installations, actually individual devices that attach to faucets and guarantee high-quality, truly drinkable water every time. And in the event of accidents the public should be provided with high-quality bottled water. Saltykov: Which is already being sold at sidewalk kiosks and in stores. The price of a one-liter bottle is R1,500-2,000 [rubles]. Professor Viktor Doyenin has calculated that his pay is insufficient to pay for food and transportation, and is not even enough for tea and watery soups. Not for his whole family. Not even just for himself. Laskorin: That cannot be! Incidentally, we are not selling domestically-produced water. This is obviously imported water. Yet transportation overhead is sizable just to transport water within Moscow, much less from Europe. The same goes for the technical expense of purification, which would not justify such high prices. If we were to start up production of bottled drinking water locally then it would be affordable not only to highly-paid segments of the population, but also to pensioners and school children. Saltykov: Then allow me to read this November ITAR-TASS report: "Jordan has purchased from Russia devices that are without parallel anywhere in the world and which allow ordinary water to be used for the most unexpected purposes at minimal cost. Tap water processed by a miniature electric activator becomes a powerful disinfectant and an effective medicine for many diseases, all without the addition of any chemicals." Prior to this interview I visited about 10 stores here in the capital, and no one had ever heard of these "activators." Laskorin: That is unscrupulous, misleading advertising. Electrochemical processing simply cannot produce that quality of water. Unfortunately, even worse "sleight of hand" is being practiced. For example, in Moscow drinking water is being used in industry for production-related purposes, and in large amounts. Such use has repeatedly been banned, but the bans are ignored. Furthermore, many Moscow enterprises -- industrial ones, not food-service enterprises -- are drilling deep wells without any request for permission or authorization whatsoever, pumping artesian well water for industrial needs -- the delicious, pure, living water that could serve as our most affordable drinking water supply. But even for that purpose we would have to calculate precisely how much of it we could use so as not to deprive our descendants of their inheritance. Saltykov: So where are we going to get drinking water? True, just a quarter of a century ago there was talk about using Lake Baikal, and there was some discussion about how it could share its unique resources with the European part of the Soviet Union. Laskorin: Unfortunately, the struggle to keep Lake Baikal pure is not over yet. Yet it represents 20 percent of the world's supply of very clean water, and 80 percent of the supply in the former USSR. Moreover, it has a unique and literally inimitable chemical composition. It could be bottled and shipped to Moscow even now. The obstacle is the cost of transportation, which is rising faster than inflation. Meanwhile the dispute over the use of a major paper combine that pollutes Lake Baikal not only continues, but is actually heating up. Over the last 25 years the decision to shut it down has been made many times. Yet now it has been privatized and continues to successfully pollute Lake Baikal "privately." Plus, the "Baikal Commission" was established on the quiet and has been granted the right to allow private corporations to develop the combine, expanding production rather than curtailing it. Saltykov: And so, Boris Nikolayevich, Lake Baikal is not accessible and the cost of bottled water is more than a majority of Russia's citizens can afford. Does that mean that city dwellers -- and perhaps soon Muscovites as well -- are going to have to go to the country and drill wells? Laskorin: There is a solution. The drinking water that flows to each apartment should receive additional purification. The first steps have been taken with the manufacture of Rodnik [Spring] individual filtration units. A filter of activated silvered charcoal -- the silver used is in very small quantities -- kills hordes of bacteria and completely removes organic, toxic and carcinogenic substances and heavy metals from water. Saltykov: But they are still beyond the reach of a majority of the population. In November a household products store not far from your institution was selling the Rodnik filter for more than R6,000. Laskorin: But what do 10 eggs cost nowadays? On our road to a free market we have run into a storm of distortions. But even if you take that madness into account, right now, in March, a Rodnik should not cost more than R3,000 in a state-owned store. And the Moscow government might even offer a special price to pensioners, students and impoverished teachers and instructors at higher educational institutions. There is definitely a need for immediate intervention by the Ministry of Health as well in order to perfect these little devices, approve them and demand that they be produced by state-owned industry immediately, even if only by a couple of the 2,000 idled defense plants. The things we have discussed are urgent needs. However, so as not just to prevent death from dead water but also to lay the ground for major efforts on the living sources, deputies in the Federation Council and the State Duma should quickly draft and approve clear-cut state legislation on preservation of natural drinking water resources, the inexpensive production of drinking water, and the right of our country's citizens not only to land but also to clean water. Primary attention should focus on children's institutions, maternity homes, hospitals, schools and other educational institutions, and pensioners. And we should demand that scientists establish a definition of drinking water that is understandable to every citizen, every deputy and every administrator.
