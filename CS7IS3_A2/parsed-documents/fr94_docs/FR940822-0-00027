FR940822-0-00027 FR940822-0-00009 (b) Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this section: Example 1. A holds 50 doses of DPT vaccine and 60 doses of polio vaccine on the last moment of August 10, 1993. A is not a member of a controlled group. A is not required to report and pay the floor stocks tax on any of the taxable vaccines because the aggregate amount of floor stocks tax payable by A (determined without regard to this section) does not exceed $1,000 ((50×$4.56 per dose of DPT vaccine) + (60×$0.29 per dose of polio vaccine) = $245.40). Example 2. D, E, and F are members of the same controlled group. On the last moment of August 10, 1993, D holds 100 doses of DPT vaccine and 160 doses of polio vaccine; E holds 80 doses of DPT vaccine, 10 doses of MMR vaccine and 60 doses of polio vaccine; and F holds 20 doses of MMR vaccine and 10 doses of DT vaccine. Without regard to this section, D is liable for a tax of $502.40 ((100×$4.56 per dose of DPT vaccine)+(160×$0.29 per dose of polio vaccine)); E is liable for a tax of $426.60 ((80×$4.56 per dose of DPT vaccine)+(10×$4.44 per dose of MMR vaccine)+(60×$0.29 per dose of polio vaccine)); and F is liable for a tax of $89.40 ((20×$4.44 per dose of MMR vaccine)+(10 X $0.06 per dose of DT vaccine)). Because the aggregate amount of floor stocks tax payable by all members of the group ($1,018.40) exceeds $1,000, each member of the controlled group must report and pay the floor stocks tax. §47.2&hyph;5 Requirements with respect to payment and return. (a) Payment of tax. The floor stocks tax is to be paid without assessment or notice on or before February 28, 1994. (b) Filing of return _(1) Form 720. Except as provided in §47.2&hyph;4(a) (relating to the de minimis exception), every person liable for the floor stocks tax must make a return of the tax on Form 720, Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return. The return is to be prepared and filed in accordance with the instructions relating to the return. (2) Time for filing _(i) In general. The Form 720 required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be filed on or before February 28, 1994, and is a return for the fourth calendar quarter of 1993. A first return reporting only floor stocks tax is also a final return and therefore, in accordance with the instructions to Form 720, the box for ``final return'' must be marked. (ii) Return reporting other taxes. A person must file only one Form 720 for a quarter. If a person is required under part 40 of this chapter to file Form 720 for the fourth calendar quarter of 1993 for other excise taxes earlier than February 28, 1994, that person files a single Form 720 for the quarter by February 28, 1994. This paragraph (b)(2)(ii) does not extend the time for making deposits or paying any excise tax.
