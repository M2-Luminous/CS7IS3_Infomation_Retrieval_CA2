Ireland Peace Efforts PM0403114894 Dublin IRISH PRESS in English 3 Mar 94 p 7 PM0403114894 Dublin IRISH PRESS Language: English Article Type:BFN [Unattributed report: "36 Million Pound EU Boost for North Peace Fund Over Three Years"] [Text] A 36 million pound contribution to peace efforts in the North was approved by the European Commission yesterday. The cash will go the International Fund for Ireland [IFI] over the next three years, on top of 72 million pounds the EU [European Union] has provided since 1989. The IFI was set up by the British and Irish Governments in 1986 to promote reconciliation as well as providing social and economic aid for the North. But the latest money from Brussels is being billed as a special response to the efforts of the two Governments to end violence. Commission President Jacques Delors said yesterday's initiative should be seen as "an expression of practical support for the peace process in Northern Ireland" in the wake of the Downing Street Declaration. The 36 million pounds will be used for projects aimed at bridging the religious divide. The Commission emphasised that the 36 million pounds was in addition to assistance to Northern Ireland already assured under the EU's regional and social funds. The IFI is managed by an independent board appointed by the two Governments. It also receives contributions from America, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
