Asia OW2201214194 Beijing XINHUA in English 2101 GMT 22 Jan 94 OW2201214194 Beijing XINHUA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Tehran, January 22 (XINHUA) -- Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi [name as received] here today denied any competition between Iran and Turkey over Central Asia. "No, there is no reason for us to compete with Turkey or other states," Mahmoud Vaezi said in an exclusive interview with XINHUA correspondents. "There is a lot of room for cooperation, for work and activities" in the Central Asia, he said. "If turkey or any other countries want to enter the Central Asian region, they can and we welcome all the countries to enter the region for cooperation." The world media have constantly reported that both the Islamic countries of Iran and Turkey want to occupy the vacuum in the Central Asian countries after the disintegration of the former Soviet Union. Asked about the worry about Iran's Islamic export to the Central Asian countries, Vaezi termed the worry as unnecessary since Iran does not want to interfere in the internal affairs of any other countries. "This is our policy. It does not matter whether it is a Central Asian country or an European country," he said, adding, "actually it is not the Central Asian countries that worry about the Islamic revolution." "It is the Western correspondents who wrote such things everyday because they do not want good relations between Iran and those countries", Vaezi said. It is just a propaganda in order to separate Iran from those countries, he noted. Referring to Iran's cooperation with the Central Asian countries, he said that Iran has started its cooperation with the Central Asian countries in many fields, such as telecommunications, air, road and shipping transportation, trade, industry and so on. Four months ago when Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani visited five Central Asian countries, 64 documents were signed between Iran and those countries, most of which cover the fields of economic cooperation, he said. The Central Asian countries have good resources but they need help in many fields, he said. The cooperation with those countries benefit both sides, he stressed. Some Iranian officials said earlier that Iran could promote its non-oil export and reduce its reliance on oil revenue by reviving the ancient Silk Road and expanding cooperation with the Central Asian countries.
