"Public construction works must have trustworthiness and transparency," said Hata, answering questions at the House of Representatives Budget Committee. "Successive scandals were regrettable." "We are taking measures such as a full-fledged introduction of the competitive bidding system. We will constantly carry out the measures in order to get rid of bid-rigging and other unjust practices," he said. In April, prosecutors announced the end of 13 months of investigations into a series of bribery scandals involving politicians and major construction firms. A total of 32 people -- including a Diet legislator, two governors, two mayors and officials of eight major construction companies and a large paper manufacturer -- were indicted as a result of the investigation.
