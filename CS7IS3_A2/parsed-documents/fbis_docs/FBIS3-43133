Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-12jan94-Russia Yeltsin Breaks Up, Takes Firmer Control of Security Organs SUMMARY President Boris Yeltsin has broken up the Ministry of Security -the successor to the old KGB--and reduced the remaining parts to several "services" directly under presidential control, presumably reducing their ability to act independently of or contrary to the president in future crises. The splintered security services have been placed under the supervision of a young presidential assistant with a strong reformist background and no previous ties with security, Yuriy Baturin, who thus becomes a key figure in Yeltsin's team. END SUMMARY In a 21 December edict declaring the "Cheka-OGPU-NKVD-NKGB-MGB KGB-MB organs unreformable" and the reorganizations of the KGB in recent years only "cosmetic," Yeltsin abolished the Ministry of Security and created a smaller Federal Counterintelligence Service (Federalnaya Sluzhba Kontrrazvedki) of the Russian Federation (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 24 December 1993). He explained in a 22 December news conference that he was disbanding the KGB- -"the last bulwark of the former Soviet totalitarian system"--and that police surveillance of the people will now end and only the counterintelligence functions of the old organization will remain (Ostankino TV, 22 December 1993). Sergey Stepashin (see box), whom Yeltsin appointed as the first deputy head of the new service, also portrayed the move as a drastic change, saying the new service will include only 75,000 employees, 46 percent less than the Ministry of Security (Radio Rossii, 5 january). At a 10 january news conference, Stepashin stated flatly that the new service will not resemble the old ministry and "all prerequisites for the revival of political surveillance have been destroyed." The service, according to Stepashin, will deal only with operations by foreign intelligence services, terrorism, and imports of drugs and weapons, and has transferred its Investigations Directorate to the prosecutor's office and its Lefortovo prison to the Ministry of Internal Affairs (Krasnaya Zvezda, 11 january). Articles in the 11 January Komsomolskaya Pravda and Pravda based on Stepashin's 10 January news conference added that some Ministry of Security units have been shif ted to the Federal Agency for Government Communications and Information and anti-crime units switched to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. In a 12 january Rossiyskaya Gazeta interview, Stepashin said some ministry directorates will be disbanded but the Directorates for Counterintelligence Operations, for Counterintelligence Supply for Strategic Installations, for Military Counterintelligence, for Economic Counterintelligence, and for Combatting Terrorism will be maintained with virtually no staff cuts. Golushko Retained The reorganization may not be as drastic as Yeltsin and Stepashin indicate, however, since it was entrusted to Minister of Security and longtime KGB official Nikolay Golushko. In a 29 December Izvestiya interview, Golushko, who was named director of the new service and ordered to prepare a statute outlining the structure and powers of the new service, spoke of only a 30 percent staff reduction and expressed disapproval of the edict's "harsh" evaluation of the ministry. When asked how many of the ministry's non-counterintelligence directorates will be abolished, Golushko hinted that there may be little change in the existing structure, replying that "virtually all of our subdivisions" had worked on counterintelligence. Yeltsin reportedly signed Golushko's statute on the new service on 5 January. The newspaper Segodnya, citing "sources close to presidential quarters," reported that the statute kept "the very same structure" as the ministry, minus the Investigation Directorate and one other directorate and made no change in the "fundamental nature" of the old ministry (Segodnya, 6 january). Although Golushko was allowed to retain the rank of minister when appointed director of the new service, the edict indicated that he will be subordinate directly to the office of the president (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 24 December 1993), rather than to Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin as part of the cabinet. A 10 january ITAR- TASS report declared that the Ministry of Security had been subordinated to both the cabinet and the president, but the new service will be subordinated only to the president. Granting Golushko ministerial rank may have been a reward for his cooperation in dissolving his ministry, as, no doubt, was Yeltsin's promotion of 27 Ministry of Security officers to general on the eve of the 21 December edict, which was reported by the 29 December Izvestiya. Other "service" chiefs do not hold ministerial rank, according to Yeltsin's 30 September 1992 edict "On the System of Central Organs of Federal Executive Power" (Vedomosti Syezda Narodnykh Deputatov Rossiyskoy Federatsii i Verkhovnogo Soveta Rossiyskoy Federatsii, 15 October 1992, pages 2936-7). (See Note 1) (Note 1) There are a variety of other "services" (sluzhby) in the government, some directly under the president, some not, but all clearly outside the cabinet. These include the Federal Tax Service, Federal Service for Foreign Currency and Export Control, the State Archive Service, the Federal Service of Geodesy and Cartography, the Federal Service of Forestry, and the Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Monitoring the Environment. Another was added on 22 December, when a Yeltsin edict formed the Federal Service for Television and Radio Broadcasting as a central organ of federal power to replace the Ministry of Press and Information (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 24 December 1993). The new counterintelligence service apparently is intended to parallel the Foreign Intelligence Service, which also is directly under the office of the president. The Federal Foreign Intelligence Service (Federalnaya Sluzhba Vneshney Razvedki Rossii) had been listed as one of the "central organs of federal executive power" in a 30 September 1992 Yeltsin edict (Vedomosti, 15 October 1992, page 2940) but only days later was dropped from this category and made "directly subordinate to the president," apparently a reduction in status, by a 7 October 1992 edict (Vedomosti, 15 October 1992, page 2964). Foreign intelligence service director Yevgeniy Primakov, like the minister of security, was designated a Security Council member in a 20 October 1993 decree defining the Security Council's membership (Sobraniye Aktov Prezidenta i Pravitelstva Rossiyskoy Federatsii, 25 October 1993, pages 4479-80), suggesting that Golushko may continue on the Security Council in his new capacity. Breakup of Old KGB Elements With the creation of the counterintelligence service, there now appear to be five agencies that have emerged from the old KGB, and all apparently are now directly under the office of the president. --The foreign intelligence part was taken out of the KGB on 18 December 1991--after the August coup and the collapse of the USSR--and made into the Federal Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation, according to the service's press secretary Tatyana Samolis (Interfax, 22 December 1993, Segodnya, 24 December 1993). Primakov, who had been named first deputy USSR KGB chairman and head of the foreign intelligence service part of the USSR KGB in September 1991 (TASS, 30 September 1991), was made director of the new Russian foreign intelligence service on 26 December 1991 (Vedomosti, 2 january 1992, page 42). "Federal" was later dropped from the service's title, and Yeltsin's 10 january 1994 edict "On the Structure of Federal Organs of Executive Power" listed it as the "Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation" (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 12 january). --About the same time--on 24 December 1991--some KGB communications units were split off and formed into a Federal Agency for Government Communications and Information under the president (Vedomosti, 2 january 1992, page 38). Former KGB General Aleksandr Starovoytov was appointed to head the agency (Segodnya, 30 july 1993). The KGB's complete control of the information flow to USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev and the ease with which the KGB had cut off Gorbachev's communications in August 1991 made clear the need to make communications independent of the KGB, according to a 5 March 1992 Rossiyskaya Gazeta article. Yeltsin used his control over this agency in his 21 September move against the parliament. Immediately after he announced the legislature's dissolution, Yeltsin ordered Starovoytov to cut off all parliament's communications (Kommersant-Daily, 22 September 1993). --On 17 December 1993 it was reported that Yeltsin had combined the Ministry of Security's subdivision for protection of the Kremlin and the leadership--the old KGB's 9th Directorate--with his presidential guard to form a new federal "presidential security service" to provide security for the president (Radio Rossii, 17 December 1993). The service was placed under Major General Aleksandr Korzhakov, the longtime head of Yeltsin's personal guards (nachalnik lichnoy okhrany prezidenta). Korzhakov had met Yeltsin when the KGB 9th Directorate formed a guard for then new Politburo candidate member Yeltsin in 1986, and Yeltsin and Korzhakov became friends (Moskovskaya Pravda, 4 July 1992). Although reportedly signed in November, the presidential edict on this new service has not appeared among the November edicts published in the Sobraniye and so the new service's exact title and status are not yet clear. However, Izvestiya on 11 january gave its title as the "Directorate for Protection of the President" (Upravleniye 0khrany Prezidenta) and Yeltsin's 10 january edict on government structure listed it as the "Main Directorate for Protection of the Russian Federation" (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 12 january). --On 30 December a Yeltsin edict formed the Federal Border Service-Central Command of Russian border troops from the border guards administration of the Ministry of Security. It is to have "status equivalent to that of a federal ministry and to operate in direct subordination to the Russian president and government" (ITAR-TASS, 30 December 1993), apparently giving it status similar to the new counterintelligence service. Yeltsin's 10 January 1994 edict on government structure specified that this service is under the president (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 12 january). Col. Gen. Andrey Nikolayev was named commander of the border troops (ITAR-TASS, 30 December 1993) and, according to the 11 january Izvestiya, chief of the Federal Border Service (Federalnaya Pogranichnaya Sluzhba). Baturin's Appointment Yuriy Baturin, appointed national security assistant (pomoshchnik) to the president by Yeltsin on 6 january (Ostankino TV, ITAR-TASS, 6 january), will play a major role in supervising and coordinating the work of the security services. The 44-year old Baturin told Interfax that Yeltsin had suddenly phoned him and told him he needed a "national security aide" and asked him to take the job. Baturin said he would be coordinating the activities of security services and everyday decisions "which must not encumber the president" and that this function encompassed the counterintelligence, foreign intelligence, border guards, and government communications services. He said that foreign intelligence head Primakov will report to the president weekly but he (Baturin) would also brief Yeltsin on intelligence matters. He said "the president entrusts his national security aide with making a decision jointly with the chiefs of these services" (Interfax, 7 january). Baturin is a recent addition to Yeltsin's staff and has been an outspoken reformer and more independent-minded than Yeltsin's other assistants. (See Note 2) A protege of reformer Georgiy Shakhnazarov, Baturin was one of the authors of the liberal Law on the Press adopted in 1990. He joined Yeltsin's Presidential Council on 17 March 1993 and became notable for expressing independent ideas often at odds with Yeltsin's other aides. When offered a post as presidential assistant in late April, Baturin reportedly accepted on condition he could continue to speak out publicly (Novaya Yezhednevnaya Gazeta, 7 july 1993). He has often appeared on the controversial television program Itogi (Argumenty i Fakty, No. 33, August 1993). (Note 2) Yeltsin's other assistants have been with him longer and stay out of the spotlight. Viktor Ilyushin, "first assistant to the president," has been with Yeltsin since 1977 in Sverdlovsk, while Lev Sukhanov has been with him since his days in the State Committee for Construction Affairs, where Yeltsin went after he was fired as Moscow party chief in late 1987 (Moskovskiye Novosti, 8 August 1993). Dmitriy Ryurikov, a career diplomat, Iran scholar, and former head of the foreign ministry's Middle East department, joined Yeltsin's staff in August 1991 (Moskovskiye Novosti, 8 August 1993). Anatoliy Korabelshchikov, appointed assistant to the president on 20 july 1991 (Vedomosti, 1 August 1991, page 1323), is responsible for ties to the cabinet (Argumenty i Fakty, No. 33, August 1993). His job was apparently to offer advice to Yeltsin on legal and political matters, and Baturin himself titled his post assistant "for legal affairs" (Izvestiya, 11 january). He explained that his function was not to draft edicts but to caution the president if draft edicts are legally objectionable (Novaya Yezhednevnaya Gazeta, 7 july 1993). Suggesting that Yeltsin places considerable trust in him, Baturin, according to the 25 September Moskovskiy Komsomolets and Izvestiya, had a hand in drafting Yeltsin's 21 September edict dissolving parliament. He also participated in preparing the statute on the new counterintelligence service in late December, according to his statements in an 11 january Nezavisimaya Gazeta interview. Since his appointment as assistant to Yeltsin, Baturin has remained outspoken and has even publicly criticized some of Yeltsin's acts. He recently criticized Yeltsin's edicts creating a Federal Service for Television and Radio Broadcasting and a Federal Committee for the Press for increasing state control over the media. He claimed that normally as a presidential assistant he has an opportunity to influence edicts, but that these media edicts were worked out by Yeltsin, Chernomyrdin, and First Deputy Premier Vladimir Shumeyko, and he only saw them after the three leaders had agreed upon them (Izvestiya, 29 December 1993). Implications By reorganizing the Ministry of Security, Yeltsin appears to be making a concerted effort to finally break the political power of the old Cheka-KGB and ensure that security functions are firmly under presidential control. The breakup, however, may not eliminate all domestic intelligence functions, since Yeltsin himself may find it worthwhile to quietly maintain some of these activities to aid him against his foes. By subordinating the new security services to the presidential assistant for national security and appointing to that post someone with no experience as a security official, Yeltsin also seems to be signalling a dimunition in the services' status and a less sympathetic approach to their interests. Yeltsin's appointment of Baturin appears to make him one of the most powerful figures in the presidential staff and a key player in the security field, along with Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, Internal Affairs Minister Viktor Yerin, and Security Council Secretary Oleg Lobov. box KGB Reformer Stepashin The 41-year old Stepashin, although a veteran of 22 years in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, has long been an advocate of reforming the KGB. As chairman of the RSFSR Supreme Soviet's Security Committee in early 1991, he insisted on removal of communist party influence from the KGB (Radio Rossii, 6 May 1991; Russian TV, 15 May 1991). He was appointed by USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev to investigate the role of the KGB in the August 1991 coup and to formulate proposals for reforming the security services (TASS, 28 August 1991). He was appointed deputy minister of a reorganized RSFSR KGB by Yeltsin in November 1991 and served in this post until October 1992 (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 13 October 1992). For more detail, see the Trends of 22 May 1991, pages 13-15; and 11 December 1991, pages 17-23. end box (AUTHOR: HAHN.
