Tsai] [Text] Taipei, May 21 (CNA) -- The state-run Export-Import Bank of the Republic of China [ROC] is planning to open a reprsentative office in Vietnam as part of its efforts to help promote the government's "southern strategy," a spokesman for the bank said Saturday [21 May]. The strategy encourages Taiwan manufacturers to increase investment in Southeast Asia. If all goes well, the spokesman pointed out, the Vietnamese office will be the bank's second such office in Asia. The bank established an office in Jakarta, Indonesia in 1990. The bank, which renders services in overseas investment credit and insurance as well as medium and long-term export-import loans, will be able to give a helping hand to Taiwan investors intending to go to Vietnam, he elaborated. Taiwan was the largest foreign investor in Vietnam at the end of 1993 with 117 investment projects totaling U.S.$1.53 billion. Currently, only two Taiwan financial institutions maintain offices in the Indochinese country. The International Commercial Bank of China has a representative office in Ho Chi Minh City and the Cathay Investment and Trust Co., Ltd. maintains a branch in Hanoi. The spokesman stressed that the export-import bank is willing to help pioneer Taiwan's overseas markets. To help achieve the goal, he said, the bank opened offices in Mexico City, Mexico and Budapest, Hungary last year.
