The need for ideology after the last symbolic reformers departed from Viktor Chernomyrdin's government has grown so much that two contenders rose simultaneously to fill the void: one--a collective one--in the form of Academicians Abalkin, Shatalin, and Petrakov; the other in the shape of Sergey Glazyev, former minister of foreign economic relations and currently chairman of the Committee on the Economy in the State Duma. Several assessments came out lately; half of them were devoted to bashing Abalkin-Petrakov-Shatalin's work; others reiterated Sergey Glazyev's program; and a few attempted a comparative analysis of these programs. As we learned the day before yesterday from the speech of Minister of the Economy Aleksandr Shokhin, there is also a third contender--Saburov. His program was delivered to the government through restricted channels, however, and at this point its content has not become a subject of public discussion. In considering the joint report of the Institute of Economics of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Reform Foundation, it makes sense to separate two principally different notions. The first is the "academicians' program": a notion constructed by way of simply renaming the report and the most superficial and subjective analysis of it by people who are believers in Gaydar's ideology. This notion is simply a projection that only remotely resembles the original source. The second notion is the actual report, namely: a list of anticrisis measures in different areas of economic policy, void of any particular ideological uniformity for the reason that each part was written by specialists in that particular area, while the three-headed author-academician either from haste or for some other reason has not gone the entire length of structuring this report into an ideological whole. All those points for which the academicians are being "trampled" (such as freezing prices in raw material sectors with possible budget subsidies for them and establishing a fixed exchange rate for the ruble) do not represent a mandatory attribute of the economic policy but are subject to discussion, say the report's authors. But what is in the report that is inarguable? That is the whole point: The report is not built on positive premises. It is based on rejection of the Adam Smith-esque approach to reforming Russia. The report's authors absolutely clearly learned the lesson of rampant liberalism in Russia, especially so in the area of reforms' humanism--or rather lack thereof. Therefore many critics of Abalkin-Petrakov-Shatalin rightfully pointed out that the authors make the cornerstone of their program not the formation of an economy that would give people the opportunity to engage in raising their own level of well-being, but rather a direct elevation of their well-being--an ideology which, for all its humanism, is absolutely unacceptable for a transition period. And the main shortcoming: The report never succeeded in identifying the priorities of the proposed economic policy as a whole. On the other hand, the report also has unquestionable merits with respect to stating and formulating the problems. These achievements are especially noticeable in the parts dealing with demographics and social problems. Overall, the role of this worthless program but decent report is positive: It has enlivened the academic and quasi-academic debate, thereby contributing to the creation of a favorable incubative climate for forming a truly sound economic ideology. The program will be used by the Cabinet of Ministers as an encyclopedia of variations of sectoral approaches; by lobbyists--as a quotation book; and by radical reformers--as a punching bag. Sergey Glazyev came no closer to ideology than the academicians. But he is much more concrete and tangible. The point is that his formulation of the main tasks takes place not in the field of narrowly delimited special sections but at the highest level of the expanse of economic policy. His program combines methods of monetary regulation of inflation and "nonmonetarist" measures. Glazyev's entire work is written as a word for word translation--a list of concrete measures that are necessary to implement because of the strengthened role of state regulation. Much is already being done by the government--for instance, the policy of encouraging the creation of financial-industrial groups. On the whole, however, Sergey Glazyev's predilection for concentrating his attention on concrete things only emphasizes the fact that what we have here is not a program of economic reform based on medium-term measures but a set of quick fixes, that is, precisely the normal kind of economic program that does not give the author the right to be considered an ideologue. Among the more interesting points in S. Glazyev's program, I would like to name a very (maybe even excessively) clear outline of the architecture of a tax system and interesting proposals on introducing a flexible system of bank reserves, which would increase for short-term and decrease for long-term credit. It is quite possible that the government would indeed implement these measures, although it would be ridiculous to expect it to carry them out to a full extent. This, however, practically exhausts the entire list of publicly known programs for saving the Russian economy. It is interesting that such a recognized maestro of the period of Russian liberalism as Gaydar and his antagonist Yavlinskiy have not seriously joined the debate. On the contrary, as soon as the niche of economic programming began to be filled by academicians, a former minister, and the ex-contender for the role of ideologue Saburov, Gaydar began to assume with greater zeal than ever before the stance of a politician (Yavlinskiy already became a politician long ago). Neither Gaydar nor Yavlinskiy pin any hopes on the government in the sense of following a particular ideology; both say rather unenthusiastically that they will support all constructive initiatives of the cabinet and oppose the government's positions they do not agree with. As to the former attempts of these leaders to head the Cabinet of Ministers, in this case they may be interpreted in two ways: as an awareness of their responsibility for Russia, or as tactical moves. These intelligent and experienced people by all their demeanor send the message that the issue of forming a new, or bringing to a new level the old, ideology of reform has ceased to be a matter of principal importance (whether it is in the current political situation or with the current political elite is another question). Today, forming an economic policy from the contradictory ideas floating in the air with respect to restoration of industry and continuing cutbacks in state expenditures belongs more in the realm of public relations than the actual ability of the government to implement this policy. Gaydar and Yavlinskiy understand this, seeing the current uncertainty as a sort of transitional stage within the framework of the transition period.
