IBEP asked which candidate the deputies and senators believe has the best chance of winning the elections, irrespective of their personal or party preferences. The conclusion turned into an embarrassing situation for PT [Workers Party] candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, who is leading the street polls. One fifth of the entire Congress chose Lula as the candidate "with the best chance of being elected president," but only half of his party bloc chose him as Itamar Franco's successor. Protected by the IBEP's commitment that full secrecy would be guaranteed, the PT bloc had two unexpected choices: 16.7 percent of PT bloc members considered that PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] leader Antonio Brito has a better chance than Lula. They also voted for Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, of the PFL [Liberal Front Party] (8.3 percent); Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf, of the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] (8.3 percent); and Senator Mario Covas, PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] Sao Paulo state, (8.3 percent). Lula gathered votes from almost all other parties: 30 percent from PDT legislators; 20 percent from the PPR; 18.6 percent from the PMDB; 18.2 percent from the PP [Popular Party]; and 15.3 percent from the PFL. After Lula, the legislators chose the following candidates as having the best chance: Antonio Brito (16 percent); Paulo Maluf (11.2 percent); Antonio Carlos Magalhaes (7.8 percent); and Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso of the PSDB (6.39 percent). The legislators belive the candidates with the least chances are Orestes Quercia of the PMDB (who only obtained 1.5 percent of legislators' votes), and Rio de Janeiro Governor Leonoel Brizola of the PDT [Democratic Labor Party] (3.3 perent). Quercia and Brizola shared one thing in common; they were only chosen by members of their own party blocs. Political Scientist Walder de Goes, the IBEP poll supervisor, said: "Legislators have always been like a measuring stick in an election year, and these results are more revealing than current street polls." Walder said the pollsters clearly explained what was required in the questionnaires: It was specified that this was not a question of personal preference, but of who they consider has the best chance of being elected president. After explaining that the IBEP methodology has a margin of error that is less than 1 percent, Walder said: "We were shocked by the results of the poll, mainly with the lack of unity within the PT regarding Lula." The poll was conducted on 2-10 Febraury among a sample of Brazilian legislators -- 104 deputies (20 percent of the Chamber of Deputies) and 25 Senators (30 percent of the Senate) -- was stratified on parties and regions encompassing five geographical regions and those party blocs represented in Congress on a proportional basis in the two houses. The polled legislators were drawn at random and the results were burned after being tabulated. The poll reveals that presidential candidates continue to carry the votes for the rest of the ticket. The majority of legislators (53.5 percercent) believe that the presidential candidate determines the choice of the voters while 15 percent believe the candidates for governors decide. Some 24.3 pecent believe both have an equal influence on voters. The majority of legislators believe the mixed district vote is the best electoral system for the country; 62.2 percent of deputies and senators support this system as opposed 31.5 percent who support the system currently in force.
