The Proposal The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to provide additional controlled airspace for Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) procedures at the Camarillo Airport. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operators executing the VOR or GPS approach at Camarillo, CA. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations for airspace areas designated as an extension to a Class D surface area are published in Paragraph 6004 of FAA order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in this Order. The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. Therefore, this proposed regulation_(1) is not a``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 10034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a Regulatory Evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this proposal rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
