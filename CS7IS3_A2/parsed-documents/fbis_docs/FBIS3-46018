Rybkin won 223 votes from the 416 members of the State Duma in this morning's voting. Twenty-eight members abstained. Rybkin told the press that he would try to cooperate with the president and the government according to the Constitution, and set up a "partner's relationship" with the upper house, or Federation Council. He said he would also work hard to maintain coordination among all members and groups of the lower house by taking into account the interests of all, including the smaller contingents. Rybkin, who holds a degree in engineering, was once a Communist Party secretary in a Volgagrad District. He was elected people's deputy in the Russia Federation Parliament of the former Soviet Union, and had been the leader of the Russian Communist Party parliamentary group in the Russia Federation. He later became a member of the Russian Agrarian Party, which nominated him for parliament following the legislative election last December.
