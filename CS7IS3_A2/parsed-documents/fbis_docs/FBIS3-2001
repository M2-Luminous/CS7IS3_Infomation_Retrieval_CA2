Song Jian inspected new and high technology development zones in Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou and new and high technology enterprises in the Torch Plan belt of Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou from 11 to 17 February. He said that one of the conspicuous characteristics that comes from comparing a new and high technology development zone to an economic development zone is that the former places even more emphasis on the transformation of domestic scientific and technological results. He also noted the need to formulate more preferential policies and to provide better conditions for large and medium-sized enterprises, scientific research institutes, and colleges and universities to set up branches in the zone to carry out the large-scale production of new and high technology products. Song Jian also spoke of the need to strive to upgrade industry's scientific and technological levels, to greatly raise productivity, and to help transform traditional industry into new and high technology industry. He said that because China's new and high technology industry is now in the beginning stage, it is essential for the development zone to provide a development base for this budding industry and to become an experimental and demonstration zone for establishing a new system. He called for promoting cooperation among large and medium-sized enterprises and scientific research institutes, and to give support to private scientific and technological enterprises and to big enterprise groups with an annual output value between 1 billion and 10 billion yuan, so that they will hold a big market share of the domestic market and compete on the international market. Song Jian held that the absorption of foreign capital and the import of foreign technologies are an important way to accelerate the development of China's new and high technology industry. He pointed out, however, the need to assimilate, master, and upgrade imported technologies so that they will help build China's superiority in technology. To upgrade industry, Song Jian called for devoting efforts to train a large number of high-level and internationalization-minded scientists and technicians. He also called for the attracting of a number of doctorate and master's degree holders and foreign-trained scholars with strong technical backgrounds, commercial skills, and excellent foreign language proficiency to work at leading organs and management departments in the development zone.
