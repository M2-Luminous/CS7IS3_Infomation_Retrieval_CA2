Efforts by extremist Islamic states to sow the seeds of Islamic fundamentalism in southeastern Europe via militant organizations from the Middle East have also been ignored. Alija Izetbegovic's "Islamic declaration" was only the tip of the iceberg. Programs by Muslim radio stations in former Bosnia-Herzegovina are currently full of aggressive Islam, Turkish words, and archaic Islamic terms alien even to Christians who have lived with Muslims for years. Women wearing Turkish trousers and veils can be seen in Sarajevo, Tuzla, Zenica, Travnik, and Bugojno. It was not a coincidence that Islamization intensified when Mustafa Efendi Ceric was appointed supreme head of the Islamic religious community in former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Since then, the political-religious-military link has formed a new concept of all-Muslim unity based on Islamic principles. The re-education of Muslims thought to have lost their way has become an imperative and is designed to enlarge the Muslim army. The willingness to become a shahid, which is a term used by all Muslim media for those who give their lives for Allah in the holy war, is highly valued in all propaganda speeches by the leaders of the Islamic religious community. Clerics exaggerate the significance of sacrifice for Islam with pathos, putting the aureola on Allah's mission while encouraging mass self-destruction. At a debate held by Bosnian Muslim intellectuals on 22 January, Ceric divided the Bosnian Muslims into four classes: Those who "can use arguments to explain why they are Muslims, because they study and read the Koran," are according to Ceric "rational-emotional-positive" Muslims. "Our Muslims who have an emotional attitude to Islam" are emotional-positive. "The third kind are the aggressive-negative Muslims, who have a complex about everything having to do with Islam or Muslims. They are disturbed by selam and merhaba [Muslim greetings]... They do not like it when I say selam to them and they reply by saying that that is not our language. If I were to say bongiorno to them they would say that it was the European way." Ceric did not bother to hide his animosity toward the Europeanization of the Bosnian Muslims as his role is to do away with such misconceptions and to tame the "aggressive-negative." "The fouth kind of my Bosnians are the indifferent ones and they do not care about selam or anything else at all because they do not have any attitude toward Islam and thus no identity," the shepherd concluded his classification of his herd. Apart from those of weak faith, Ceric also targets the education and the schools, particularly textbooks that do not mention or hardly deal with the international recognition of Bosnia-Herzegovina or describe the enemies of Muslims. Speaking about Islamic fundamentalism and Pan-Islamism at the debate mentioned above, Ceric said that fundamentalism was a large project but that "in view of our location, our numbers, and our ambitions, we are not linked with that project." An explanation follows: "As our problem is a global and not a local one, we are also interested in the project of Islamic fundamentalism and we have to be aware of this as our project is seen as part of that fundamentalism, because Europe views Islam as a crime." This is the way Ceric and other Islamic leaders discipline their people in the name of Allah, in other words, by driving them into slaughter-houses, into a war without an end and without any sense. Naturally, at the same time, they are not worried whether Allah will forgive them for this. The mechanism of coercion to do what Ceric regards to be the duty of every Muslim was in evidence two days ago when the religious leader received the commanders of the Muslim army and the police, Rasim Delic and Bakir Alispahic. "The defense of Bosnia is equally the patriotic and the religious duty of every Muslim, and the Islamic religious community will continue to give all necessary aid in that struggle," Ceric said. Identifying patriotism and religion and replacing humanity with fanaticism and warmongering is a huge and the worst contribution by the Islamic religious community to the suffering of the Muslims and others who are forced to take part in the war cataclysm by such an orientation of the Muslim religious, military, and political leadership.
