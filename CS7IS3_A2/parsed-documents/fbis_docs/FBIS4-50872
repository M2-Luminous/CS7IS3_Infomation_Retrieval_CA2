The institute attributed the growth to rising foreign and overseas investment in Taiwan, strong export competitiveness, the economic recovery in the United States, and a depreciating NT [New Taiwan] dollar. Rising investment can be seen from the 29 percent growth in foreign and overseas investments made in Taiwan during the first four months of this year. This is the first positive growth after two consecutive years of negative growth, and is an indication that foreign investors are gaining confidence in Taiwan's investment climate. Brought up by rising interest rates and a recovering economy in the United States, the depreciating NT dollar is favorable for Taiwan's exports. Strong export trade also constitutes a factor in pushing up manufacturing production, the institute said.
