FR941202-2-00078 FR941202-2-00055 Knowledge and Abilities Catalog Revision; Notice of Availability AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Notice of availability. SUMMARY: NUREG&hyph;1122, ``Knowledge and Abilities Catalog for Nuclear Power Plant Operators: Pressurized Water Reactors,'' and NUREG&hyph;1123, ``Knowledge and Abilities Catalog for Nuclear Power Plant Operators: Boiling Water Reactors,'' were developed in 1985 to assist operator licensing examiners in the development of content valid written and operating examinations to administer to reactor plant operators and senior operators. The Knowledge and Abilities (K/A) catalogs have been revised to resolve inconsistencies between the two catalogs and inconsistencies in content within the K/A catalogs. The revision also incorporates evolutionary changes in the operator licensing program and revised definition of operator's tasks within facility licensee's organizations. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission held public workshops on August 2&hyph;5, 1994, and conducted discussions regarding the draft revisions to the K/A catalogs. The results of the workshops have been incorporated into a draft revision to the K/A catalogs. The Commission believes that it would be beneficial to obtain public comment on this revision from all interested parties. After considering public comments, the NRC staff expects to issue the revised K/A catalogs for use in operator licensing examinations. DATES: Comment period ends January 6, 1995. Comments received after this date will be considered if it is practical to do so, but the Commission is able to assure consideration only for comments received on or before this date.
