Guntis Ulmanis is new to politics. Until now, only his surname was well known: His grandfather's brother, Karlis Ulmanis, was perhaps the most striking figure in the history of prewar Latvia. Many were sceptical about the political future of the young Ulmanis, but they have been proved wrong. He is frank, open, and not afraid to assume responsibility -- that is, of course, obvious. Ulmanis travels around the republic to meet people a great deal. According to the constitution, the president's functions are largely representative. He apparently does not bear political responsibility for the many decisions adopted by the Saeima (parliament) and the government. But it is clear that Guntis Ulmanis does not intend to be a mere figurehead. Admittedly, the president's potential to exert a more active influence on the situation is limited by legislation. That is why the quantity of his meetings with ordinary people and political leaders has yet to translate into quality of decisions and actions. Is this not indicated by the slight drop in the head of state's rating at the beginning of January: Words are all very well, but what about some action? The Latvian leader's hobbyhorse is the unity of the Baltic countries. On taking up office, Ulmanis organized a meeting of the three Baltic presidents; and he constantly consults with them on all the most important aspects of foreign policy. A feature of the Latvian situation is that the president, the Saeima, and the government have managed to retain unity. This conflict-free existence is perhaps explained by the fact that Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs' cabinet is formed by the ruling coalition in parliament, which incorporates the two leading factions: the Latvian Way and the Peasants' Union. When the Saeima is in recess, the Latvian government has extensive powers, which it uses. Valdis Birkavs, who headed the cabinet of ministers in the summer, is educated and a well-known lawyer. Journalists have nicknamed him "the smiling prime minster." Birkavs can be seen as a veteran politician: He was deputy chairman of the Latvian Supreme Soviet. The prime minister endeavors to explain every move he makes and tries to avoid secrecy. His team includes quite a few emigres, who have returned to help Latvia at this difficult time of revival. This certainly goes a long way to explaining their Western style of work, which means openness without fail. Latvian Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs tries to maintain a balance between the wishes of emigre leaders -- many of whom have not returned to the republic but help by championing Latvia's interests in the world arena -- and the line taken by Latvia's own politicians. The minister believes that continuing talks with Russia will be the main task in 1994. Janis Jurkans, Andrejevs' predecessor and current leader of the Latvian Accord faction, can be seen as the main opponent of the present foreign policy line. He believes that Latvian security can only be guaranteed by stabilizing Latvian society, which is impossible without serious consideration for the interests of Latvia's noncitizens, who make up one-third of the population. Jurkans does not dispute the idea of building a national, single-community state, but he proposes more liberal methods. The desire to increase the percentage of Latvians in Latvia one way or another and bring their number up to a minimum of 75 percent is producing laws which are drawing increasing attention to Latvia in the world community. Latvian politicians have requested the European Union to set up a program to repatriate people wishing to leave the Latvian state. In their view, Western Europe must carry some of the blame for the fact that the consequences of World War II have not been eliminated in Latvia, as reflected in the demographic situation. So far, however, these appeals have met with no response from Western countries. Latvia is also dissatisfied because Russia does not have a comprehensive program to take care of its compatriots. The internal problem of how to treat permanent residents of Latvia who are not automatically granted citizenship, as is done in other former Soviet republics, has become one of the main problems of Latvian foreign policy. There is no doubt that this is holding back the development of normal relations with Russia. Incidentally, Russians are not the only ones to be left in a state of limbo: 81,200 Belarusians, 58,000 Ukrainians, 25,000 Lithuanians, 23,000 Poles, 8,000 Jews, 3,000 Tatars, and 2,600 Germans are also without citizenship.... The foreign policy bias of the national radical opposition is well known: All those who have come to Latvia since 1940 are "colonists" with no rights other than the right to go back to their land of origin. And it looks as if this point of view is gaining increasing support. Judging by the results of sociological surveys, the positions of the Latvian Way faction were dramatically weakened on the eve of the local elections, but the hardliners have now strengthened them.
