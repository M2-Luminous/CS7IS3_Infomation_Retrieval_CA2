The Ministry said in a statement that Zhirinovskiy, who arrived here Thursday at the invitation of the tiny National Social Union of Slovenia, had "offended public order" and "caused consternation among part of the Slovenian public." The Ministry call for him to leave "as quickly as possible" came after the leader of Russia's Liberal Democratic Party said Slovenia should form part of a reconstituted Yugoslavia. Last month, Zhirinovskiy angered Bulgarian officials and was promptly asked to leave the country after calling on the president to step down. At a press conference in the northwestern town of Bled Friday, Zhirinovskiy said Slovenes, Croats and Serbs should reunite in a single state. "Slovenes are perhaps happy to have their own state, but if everyone followed their example it would lead to catastrophe," he added. He stressed that he was against the use of arms to resolve conflicts, as this would set the stage for "a third world war," and that countries' frontiers should be respected. The only way to stabilize the situation in former Yugoslavia was for United Nations troops to withdraw, he added. He warned that if the world body approved the use of North Atlantic Treaty Organisation air strikes in Bosnia he would personally "call on (the Russian) parliament to vote for Russia to leave the UN." The Ministry statement said Zhirinovskiy's entourage had "grossly violated public order" during their stay in Bled. It called on Russia's charge d'affaires in Ljubuljana to ensure Zhirinovskiy and his team left Slovenia promptly. [passage omitted] Zhirinovskiy was due to spend Saturday and Sunday in the Slovenian resort of Portoroz on the Adriatic coast before leaving for Belgrade. His Belgrade host Velimir Cvetic, head of the Social Democratic Party of Yugoslavia, earlier said Zhirinovskiy would be invited to visit the Serb-styled Serb republics in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina respectively.
