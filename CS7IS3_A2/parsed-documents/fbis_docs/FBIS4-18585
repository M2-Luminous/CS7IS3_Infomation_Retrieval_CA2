I will begin with you, Mr. Tayyip Erdogan. You are now at the head of a big metropolis, Istanbul. Istanbul is the capital of empires, a multilingual and multinational city. You received 25 percent of the votes, despite 75 percent of the populace opposing you. This could have been the case for any other party such as the True Path Party or the Motherland Party, but 75 percent of the population believes that your party is ideologically different. As you yourself claim, the Prosperity Party [PP] is the one that will change the order and the population is apprehensive about what you plan to change. [Erdogan] Firstly, I would like to thank you for arranging this forum, as speculation is rife these days both regarding our party and ourselves. There are also provocations. We regret them. Only recently, it was 0200 in the middle of the night, I held my head in my hands and started to weep. Are we not the children of this country? We were also born and bred in this country. [Muhtar] What incidents are you referring to? [Erdogan] Certain ugly things appearing in the media genuinely distressed us. We have been elected mayor and the PP is a party established within the framework of the country's laws. In other words, we must discuss what we must do in this office. A certain sector of the media, however, is driving our people into a justified fear. We are sorry about this. There is nothing to fear. We are not in a position to question anyone's dress code. As I stated during many panel discussions, the municipality will fulfill its duty respecting the existing culture in Istanbul, regardless of opinions or faith. [Muhtar] Are you saying that there will be no change in the social life? [Erdogan] This is our position as the municipality: We will exercise our authority without resorting to bribery, exploitation, or corruption. Let us look at Article 58 of the Constitution. It is highly beneficial to read this article, which protects our youth from bad habits. As the municipality, it is up to us to control whether such institutions are sanitary. I announced that if I go on an inspection tour, I will not be the one to conduct the inspection. I will inform the media and hand over the inspection file to the media and ask them to conduct the inspection. [Muhtar] Naturally, you do not have the authority to open or close down certain places. Most restaurants or entertainment places in Istanbul cannot be said to keep clean back rooms or kitchens. This grants you extensive authority. If you wish to close down certain places on the basis of your ideology, then you can use public health as an excuse. One cannot truthfully say that health conditions are exemplary in such places either in Istanbul or Ankara. [Erdogan] Are you saying that they should work in such dirty conditions? [Muhtar] No, this is not what I mean. Everything is below the standard you cite. I am saying that there is such a fear. [Erdogan] This raises another issue. It was not the PP that determined this standard, but its predecessors. [Muhtar] This is not a matter of standard, but one of society. [Erdogan] No. We may have set different standards, but the current standards were set by other parties. Moreover, I am saying that I will not be the one to control this standard. I will invite the media and show them the inspection file, which was not prepared by the PP. I will ask them if they are willing to eat and drink in such places. We must be realistic. They will say no. I will then ask them to apply the appropriate sanctions. I will not be the one to apply them. We will show what a participatory democracy is in this country. We will not, however, accept bribes to look the other way. This we will not do. [Muhtar] In other words, you will consider only public health and environmental aspects. [Erdogan] We will only demonstrate our sincerity in implementing the existing laws. [Muhtar] I would now like to address you, Mr. Melih Gokcek. You are the mayor of the capital of the country, the seat of the republican ideology. Will the social life of the citizens of Ankara change in any way? [Gokcek] They will live as they wish, the same as before. We will run the municipality. The citizens' personal lives concern only them, not us. [Muhtar] All the institutions of the Turkish Republic are located in Ankara. You are member of a party in favor of changing the order. Do you feel apprehensive about being in the capital? [Gokcek] Certainly not. I was born in Ankara. [Muhtar] I was not referring to the citizenship issues. I was referring to Ankara as the seat of the republican ideology. [Gokcek] Why should we feel apprehensive? We were born and bred here. [Muhtar] What kind of policy will you pursue? [Gokcek] As far as the order is concerned, there are naturally aspects of which I do not approve. You would not approve of them either. It is necessary to define what we mean by the order in the country. For example, do you condone corruption? Can you condone it? [Muhtar] This is not what I meant. [Gokcek] Corruption and bribery have become a part of the order. I will change this order. This is inevitable. [Muhtar] I was referring to the constitutional order. [Gokcek] There are also aspects within the constitutional order which must be changed. A constitution was drafted in 1924; another was introduced in 1960. [Muhtar] You are mayor under the existing constitution. [Gokcek] Those who come to power seem to change what their predecessors have done. [Muhtar] You are the two mayors under the current constitutional order. There may be conflicts between your views and the constitution. How will you act in light of this conflict? [Gokcek] One is obliged to abide by the laws. There is no other way. I would exert every possible effort to change the law if I do not approve of it as a member of parliament. As a mayor, however, I do not have such authority or influence. As a mayor, I have to accept and implement the laws handed down by the Turkish Grand National Assembly. There is nothing else to do, even if I do not approve of the laws. [Muhtar] Recently the press has carried reports about PP members, supporters, or more radical circles interfering in women's dress code or forcing them off buses. Is this post-election euphoria? [Gokcek] These reports are false. A party member would never do such things. Since we were elected into office, we have appealed to the citizens to report persons who harass them to the authorities. You will see that they are not members of the PP, they are merely provocateurs. I have here in my hand several faxes. One of them states: Women employees must be discouraged from wearing short skirts, pants, shorts, or other revealing attire. This fax was sent by the Halk Bank. [Erdogan] I would like to issue a reminder. There are attempts to create the impression that the PP is heading a municipal authority for the first time. This party was in power in 1974; it was a coalition partner in 1975 and 1976. Its members were mayors in over 100 municipalities before the latest elections, including bid cities, provinces, districts, and townships. Do you believe that anything happened to trigger these complaints? [Muhtar] When you assumed office, you visited the Ataturk Mausoleum. Certain circles were not expecting such a visit on your part. [Gokcek] This was not my first time. [Muhtar] No, but this time you visited as a PP mayor. Did this cause any resentment in the party grassroots? [Gokcek] This is concocted by certain elements in the public and they are the ones who believe in it. In other words, they create the ogres in their heads and then they believe them. In public offices, for example, they scare the citizens. They have no right to do this. [Muhtar] What will happen in the municipalities? I am directing this question to both of you. Will women employees continue to work? [Gokcek] What woman employee was disturbed during the five years that I served as mayor of Kecioren? I was also general director of the Child Protection Association for two and a half years and I ask if any women employees were disturbed during that time. This is not logical. [Erdogan] Let me tell you this: We are heading the municipalities in six districts and three townships in Istanbul at the moment. You can question all the women in these municipalities on whether we interfere in their dress code. The dress code was introduced before us. We believe women can dress as they wish. There are women in some Istanbul municipalities who wanted to cover themselves, but were unable to do so. They could not cover their heads because they feared being dismissed. There are maybe 10 or 11 such women. [Muhtar] You became the head of such an important city. In the first days, it was announced that a mosque will be built in the middle of Taksim Square. Is this a very important issue for you? Or, did you not announce this? [Erdogan] This was initiated by the press. They came and asked me. I replied as follows: When the Taksim mosque issue was raised for the first time 20 years ago, I became a trustee of this project. A foundation exists in connection with this project. The mosque will not be built by the municipality. It will be built by the foundation. When the foundation applies for the project, I will make the necessary arrangements and hand the land over to the foundation. [Muhtar] Are you referring to the parking lot? [Erdogan] Yes. It is a parking lot at the moment. [Muhtar] What I am trying to say is that the day you became the mayor of a large metropolis like Istanbul you announced that a mosque will be built in Taksim. [Erdogan] No, it was not my first statement. I merely answered a question. You are the ones who are asking the questions. [Muhtar] Does that mean you will not concern yourself with these questions? [Erdogan] These are my [word indistinct] issues. These are legal topics. As the mayor, I will exercise any authority in my jurisdiction to the benefit of my people, and not as a hostile action against my people. I would like to explain the following: There are even things that violate the Constitution. Article 58 bans alcoholic drinks and bad habits. Even though the Constitution is being violated here, the media is still trying to portray me as opposed to the Constitution. [Muhtar] How does the Constitution ban alcoholic drinks? [Erdogan] Article 58 cites bad habits, alcoholic drinks, and notes that the state should take the necessary measures with regard to these matters. [Muhtar] The Constitution also defends individual freedoms, each person's private life. [Erdogan] Article 58 is very interesting. It says: The state will adopt the necessary measures to protect the youth in the face of addiction to alcohol, narcotics, criminality, gambling, and similar bad habits, as well as ignorance. [Muhtar] It mentions the youth. In other words, you can drink if you are an adult. You say that our Constitution bans alcohol. [Erdogan] Yes. Turkey is such a strange country. It is the only country in the world, in which the state itself produces alcoholic drinks. [Muhtar] Approximately 75 percent of the population is opposed to you. You will serve as [word indistinct] mayors. You must be flexible and you are trying to create such an image at the moment. [Gokcek] By the same token, 87 percent are against the Social Democratic Populist Party. [Muhtar] Yes, but as you have said, these parties are all parties who favor the existing order and therefore the opposition does not create such a contrast. [Erdogan] How high was the high jump bar placed? Let us say at a height of 1.8 meters. We jumped from 1.8. We will be able to jump even if they place the bar at 2 meters. We will abandon everything else and begin practicing high jumping. [Gokcek] As someone said, if they succeed once, they will never fail again. Of course, we will succeed. We are destined to succeed. [Muhtar] The fact that a large sector of the population is against you and you are a party opposed to the existing order places 75 percent of the population locked against you. You are the mayor. There are artists and the media in your cities and these factors are very dominant. Now, sitting here in front of me, you are creating a very moderate image. Are you playing tricks, or.. [Gokcek] Again you are putting words into our mouths. [Muhtar] I am merely asking. [Erdogan] Moreover, our lives are in the open. We did not come from another planet. We are currently living here. [Muhtar] So, you are not playing tricks. [Erdogan] We did not come from outer space. We were born and bred here and we live here now. [Muhtar] Will you always respect democracy? [Gokcek] Do you doubt it? [Muhtar] I am asking on behalf of the society. [Erdogan] Do you personally doubt it? [Muhtar] I am not important as a person. It is the society that is important. [Erdogan] Are you trying me on behalf of the society? [Muhtar] I am asking because the society has doubts. [Erdogan] Those who now claim to exist in the name of democracy are not democrats; on the contrary, they are democratic dictators. [Muhtar] You made a statement in response to Istanbul Governor Kozakcioglu's remarks. You reportedly warned him to be careful. [Erdogan] I did not make a statement addressing the governor. Only the following is true: We are assuming power, knowing the laws pertaining to municipalities. We are aware of our rights. The honorable governor is obliged to act objectively. [Muhtar] Are you disturbed about the governor's remarks? [Erdogan] I still cannot conceive that the governor made such a statement. I read this in the press, but I do not believe that he made such a statement. It is not the governor's duty to judge the PP. I had not even assumed my post when the statement was made. I had not even announced what my actions will be. The governor's duty is to be objective; he can never have the right to judge the PP. We plan to cooperate with the governor in Istanbul and take this city further to better days. [Muhtar] It is not easy to govern millions. Some of your supporters or circles close to you may have indulged in excessive behavior. The citizens of Istanbul and Ankara probably experienced this. We were informed of such incidents and I do not think that everyone is telling lies. Do you plan to take measures against this, against persons telling others how to dress or behave on the streets? [Gokcek] Let me tell you clearly. Our own supporters do not engage in such actions. These are lies deliberately spread by members of the Social Democratic Populist Party after this party lost the elections. [Muhtar] Do you deny that such incidents took place? [Gokcek] The incidents did occur, but the perpetrators are clearly provocateurs. [Erdogan] We caught three men dressed as veiled women and they fled using their weapons. [Muhtar] Are these not connected to you? [Erdogan] No. [Muhtar] Maybe your party is not involved, but you cannot control all the millions who vote for you. [Gokcek] We are making an appeal. I have already issued calls on television and now I am repeating myself on your program. I am saying that all this harassment on dress code or other issues consists entirely of provocations. I am calling on the citizens to catch such persons and hand them over to the security and to us. Let us pursue the matter. [Erdogan] I personally experienced an incident. In addition to cases in which women dressed in revealing clothes were not allowed on buses, I heard that women wearing head covers at the Theology Department in Baglarbasi, Istanbul, were also refused on vehicles. This creates hostile camps, which is very unfortunate. [Muhtar] Since we are talking about polarization, I would like to ask another brief question. Will there be segregation on buses? [Erdogan] Absolutely not. These are mere fabrications.
