List 99 leader Renan Rodriguez, whose position was never too far from the Colorado Party and who opened the round of speeches at the ceremony, said the agreement is the result of a natural operation and "the soldering process will not leave rough edges" because, as in the past, both factions will form a single political entity. PGP leader Hugo Batlle, who spoke afterward, did not talk about a return to basics or to his Colorado Party origins. He spoke about the importance of the agreement, stressing that it was made between "two different political groups with a common past" that are and will continue to be independent from each other. Renan Rodriguez--without hiding his satisfaction over the agreement--compared former President Julio Maria Sanguinetti and Jose Batlle y Ordonez. He said Sanguinetti was "a natural candidate for the presidency of the Republic," just as Batlle was the Colorado Party's natural leader in 1910. He mentioned the difficulties each had during their first governments and stressed that in Batlle's case the people "very much wanted him to continue his work." Rodriguez said that something similar occurs today with Sanguinetti. Batlle, in turn, characterized the ceremony as something that could change the country's future, adding that the Batllist forum as well as the PGP have given proof of their "deep civic courage." "We are doing what people expected us to do long ago. People wanted to see leaders with courage to break the routine, the prejudice, the past, heal the old wounds," the List 99 leader said. "Many things that happened in the past will not occur again, and many things that never happened will start occurring now, Batlle said [no end quotation mark as published]. The phrase was received with long applause. He said he trusted the agreement will serve to build a better country for all Uruguayans "seeking equality from the beginning." Sanguinetti: Count the Stones. The Batllist Forum leader [Luis Maria Sanguinetti] closed the ceremony with a speech that began with a citation from a great poet (Elliot) and was closed with a phrase that belonged to another famous artist. "We will begin by counting the stones so as to be able to finish counting the stars." Referring to the agreement, Sanguinetti said the voices that called for it from the silent past have said: "We want unity among leaders so that unity can be possible among citizens." Sanguinetti said this was the reason he had taken "this hopeful step for unity." "Today we have fewer rich people than during Batlle y Ordonez's times. We also have fewer poor people. But the needs and those in need have increased. A democratic society cannot accept the duality of having groups that reach modernity while other groups sink in degradation," Sanguinetti said, adding: "A country's sensitivity cannot be measured only by its respect for majorities but by its sensitivity toward minorities." Sanguinetti said we cannot have "another irrational confrontation between the state and the market" similar to the confrontation between cities and rural areas. "The country needs of all its citizens. A modern society needs us all," the leader said.
