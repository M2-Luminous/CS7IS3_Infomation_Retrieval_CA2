Mr Deng, 89, is expected to make a short speech before a specially invited audience of Shanghai government and Communist Party leaders on Lunar New Year's Eve, February 9. According to sources in the municipal Government, the patriarch's speech will focus on the need for government officials to "further liberate their thinking" and "overcome the fear of making mistakes". Such "thought liberation" is necessary if Shanghai is to maintain its spectacular development of the past three years and regain its place as financial and commercial capital of the Asia Pacific region, Mr Deng is expected to say. In his meetings with Shanghai Party secretary Wu Bangguo and Mayor Huang Ju at the secluded Xijiao State Guesthouse during the past few weeks, Mr Deng is said to have expressed satisfaction with the pace of economic reform and development in Shanghai in the past year. But he voiced concern that some cadres were still being too hesitant, sources said. "Comrade Xiaoping pointed out that some cadres are still worrying about whether reforms are capitalist or socialist and that they should liberate their thinking on this point," one well placed source said. "He said it doesn't matter if you make mistakes because mistakes can be rectified," the source said. The patriarch's planned New Year's Eve address will probably be his only formal public appearance in Shanghai this winter. Apart from a short visit with his daughter and private secretary Deng Rong to the newly-completed Yangpu suspension bridge linking northern Shanghai with Pudong and a trip to the top of the Jinjiang Tower Hotel, Mr Deng has not made any sightseeing excursions since arriving in Shanghai in December. The patriarch, who is said to be in poor health, spends most of his time resting at the Xijiao State Guesthouse in the west of the city. His only regular outing is to the Huadong Hospital to receive medical treatment, sources said. He is said to visit the hospital every morning at 10.30 for a massage and acupuncture treatment before returning to his guesthouse. Mr Deng and his entourage travel between the hospital and the guesthouse in an unmarked minivan.
