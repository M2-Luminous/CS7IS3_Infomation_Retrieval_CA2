A grouping of Strategic Missile Forces comprising two missile divisions is currently stationed on Belorussian territory. They include 8 missile regiments armed with RS-12M Topol road-mobile missile complexes. The total number of missile launchers is 72. Under this year's jointly agreed timetable, one-half of these will be withdrawn from Belorussia [Belarus] to Russia, and the rest will follow by the end of next year. By the middle of 1996 the Mozyr and Lida Divisions will be completely disbanded. All the missile troops' military bases and housing compounds will be handed over to the Belorussian side. We already have experience of this work. Last summer nine missile launchers were withdrawn from Postavy to Russia following close cooperation between the Russian and Belorussian sides. What will happen to the "Belorussian" nuclear weapons next? The weapons and military hardware that are being withdrawn will be held at Strategic Missile Forces arsenals in Russia, where they will subsequently be used as an exchange fund to replace weapons that have reached the end of their service life in missile regiments on combat alert in Russia. What does the future hold for the missile troops themselves? Lieutenant General Viktor Yesyan, chief of the Strategic Missile Forces Headquarters Operations Directorate, said that they would serve in Russian units that are currently undermanned. Officers and warrant officers who have expressed a desire to remain in Belorussia will be discharged from the ranks of the Russian Armed Forces. Their status has been defined by a special agreement between the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense and the Republic of Belarus Ministry of Defense regarding the procedure for performance of military service by officers, ensigns, and warrant officers. This agreement has been approved by the Russian and Belarusian Governments and is being rigorously implemented. Officers and warrant officers who used to serve in the Strategic Missile Forces and who remain in Belorussia will enjoy all the rights of citizens of this republic. There have been no cases of encroachment on these rights.
