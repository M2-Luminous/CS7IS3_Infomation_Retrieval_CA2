In particular we want to do this with France, which will take over the presidency from us. We have agreed that as part of the troika, in which we will find ourselves for one year, we will tackle important European tasks in close partnership and cooperation. The French foreign minister and I concur that the German-French partnership remains a firm condition for European unity and further integration. Four features will characterize our EU presidency. First, Europe needs a stimulus for modernization to enter the information age, if we are to create future jobs in global competition with North America and Asia. We Europeans will only survive the changes if we change ourselves. The rapid and determined implementation of the action plan of the Council of Europe in Brussels will be quite high on the agenda of the Council of Europe in Essen. Therefore the government considers it a priority matter to overcome the obstacles to private initiative and self-responsibility among citizens, especially in view of the difficult budget situation. We must also not make citizens in Europe dependent solely or primarily on the state. Second, the prosperity gap between us and the countries of Central Europe must be overcome, and our eastern neighbors must be brought closer to the western zone of stability. During the election campaigns, especially the European election campaign, I have been trying to provide a single example that illustrates what we are concerned with. An hourly wage in Leipzig and Dresden, and I deliberately mention cities in the new laender, is equal to half a day's wage in Budapest, a day's wage in Poland, and a monthly wage in Kiev. That illustrates the problems. I will continue to inform our European partners that we cannot suddenly tell the countries of Central and East Europe that there is no room for them in our European home after we have been telling them for decades to abandon communism and their system and join the Western community. Third, if we do not want to lose the support of our citizens for Europe, we must urgently achieve progress in expanding Europol and formulating a common refugee, asylum, and immigration policy. That will be a decisive test for Europe. Fourth, we must do everything we can to consolidate the EU during our presidency and, in this respect, prepare for the 1996 government conference. We are dealing with more than just an ideological dispute about whether the EU should consolidated or whether it should be expanded. We are dealing with an issue that will affect the future European Parliament, and with justification. Ladies and gentlemen, during our EU presidency we Germans want to provide good examples. Many eyes will be fixed upon us from 1 July onward, and there will be great expectations of us. That concerns everyone, both the federation and the laender. Therefore we must commit ourselves fully and perform our task with zest. The presidency's task will be to establish top priorities that serve the interests of the community. These priorities need not always converge with national priorities, but it has been proved again and again that German interests are best serve when they are implemented together with our partners. National and European interests are always closely linked. That applies to the French and Dutch no less than it applies to us, and that will be the most important signpost for our presidency.
