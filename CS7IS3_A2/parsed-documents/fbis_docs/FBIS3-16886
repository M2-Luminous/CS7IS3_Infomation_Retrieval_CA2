Cherepkov was unseated Wednesday evening. Addressing the present situation in Vladivostok, Samoylov said he had kept an eye on Cherepkov's performance ever since he rose to power. Soon after he was elected Mayor, Cherepkov arrived in Moscow with a bulky package of documents detrimental to the image of Governor Yevgeniy Nazdratenko of the Primorskiy Region. A subsequent inquiry showed, however, that the negative data related mostly to performance by Nazdratenko's predecessor Kuznetsov. Cherepkov's opponents responded in kind and presented Moscow with a package of negative data on his performance. They claimed, among other things, that, pretending to be a sea captain, Cherepkov had visited Japan to buy a dozen cars. According to Samoylov, Cherepkov spent at least four of his several months in office in Moscow. His dispute with the region's leaders diverted his attention from the city's problems. More than once he moved to restructure the city government, took control of the districts' budgets and earmarked substantial sums in aid to the local media editions which acted as his mouthpiece. His efforts to update the city government proved a failure. The State Legal Administration suggested that Governor Yevgeniy Nazdratenko unseat Cherepkov. First, however, Nazdratenko was to have appeared on television to explain what motivated his move against the Vladivostok Mayor. The Primorskiy Administration preferred to stall until Viktor Cherepkov was accused of bribe-taking and a number of his associates were arrested, several weeks ago. On representation from the court authorities, Cherepkov was finally removed from office.
