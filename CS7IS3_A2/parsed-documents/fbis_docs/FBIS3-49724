Among other things, it also examined the situation in Croatia's railways. [passage omitted] One of the most important points on the agenda was entitled: the situation in Croatia's energy network. This referred mainly to certain cases of incomprehension and misunderstanding between the Slovene and Croatian sides about the Krsko nuclear plant, and as regards an outstanding debt owed by the Croatian Electricity Board to the Krsko nuclear plant. However, this is only a pretext for some disagreements; the real reasons are of another nature. Minister of Industry Nadan Vidosevic said there will be no problem about paying the 40 million German mark debt. He added: [Begin Vidosevic recording] The central issue is that we are demanding an interstate treaty, we want extremely clear and correct relations, and we are demanding the protection of 50 percent of our property, which according to some estimates is around $1 billion. This is a huge sum which Croatia, acting as a responsible country, simply has to protect. That is the central issue. I hold that we simply ought to protect our interests, and strictly abide by the standpoint that we will settle our financial obligations, but the Slovene side has to accept the drawing up of an interstate treaty; we must return to the framework of the 1970 agreement, according to which 19 Croats will go back to work [in the nuclear plant].
