The total balance of the current account of the balance of payments as the sum total of the preceding balances was therefore in deficit to the tune of Sk17.211 billion ($559 million). After including the balance on the capital and financial account, which ended in a surplus of Sk17.790 billion ($675.9 million), and the item of mistakes and errors (minus Sk1.111 billion, that is, minus $58 million), the total balance of payments of the Slovak Republic ended in a surplus of Sk1.69 billion ($58.5 million). However, this positive result of the balance of payments is attributable, to a large extent, to credits taken abroad -- the issue of NBS bonds to an amount of Sk7.6 billion, an IMF loan of Sk3 billion, a World Bank loan of Sk1.1 billion, import liabilities of the entrepreneurial sector of Sk8.7 billion, and the drawing on resources from commercial banks' lines of credit to an amount of Sk6.8 billion. The external indebtedness of the Slovak Republic increased last year, with the gross debt in foreign currency reaching $3.622 billion by the end of the year.
