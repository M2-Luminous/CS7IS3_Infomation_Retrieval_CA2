V. Adushkin, A. A. Spivak and V. I. Kulikov, Dynamics of Geospheres Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences; UDC 550.34+622.235] [Text] The characteristics of a real geophysical medium, governed by tectonics (anisotropy, spatial nonuniformity of deformation and strength characteristics, as well as stressed state, accumulation of irreversible effects of a different character on structural dislocations), exert a substantial influence on the nature of the mechanical effects of an underground nuclear explosion [1, 2, 3]. The position of deformations near structural dislocations (zones of reduced medium strength) may lead to the appearance of quite large relative movements of structural blocks, and accordingly, the freeing of stored energy, even in the case of external disturbances insignificant in amplitude. The appearance of clearly expressed irreversible effects in the medium (ruptures, fractures, faults, overthrusts, intensification of relaxation processes, etc.) at epicentral distances from the place where the underground explosion is set off considerably exceeding the extent of the zone of regular failure of the medium [4] (zone of local irreversible effects), for example, is noted. The seismic effects of an underground explosion, as the most sensitive to a spatial change in medium properties, best reflect the influence of its structural-tectonic organization. In addition to a sharp change in the amplitude characteristics of seismic explosion waves with propagation across large fractures and faults [5], an indirect effect of tectonic dislocation as a result of freeing of a part of the stored elastic energy, which is clearly manifested in a sharp change in the directivity pattern of surface and transverse waves [6, 7], has been repeatedly noted. In this article a study is made of the influence of the structural organization of the geophysical medium on the principal effects of an underground nuclear explosion set off on 8 July 1989 (03[.sup]h[/]46 min 57.64 sec) in the Balapan rock mass at the Semipalatinsk test site (coordinates 49�52 min 05.7 sec N and 78�46 min 45 sec E, power q = 35 kt, depth 550 m). The rock mass at the place where the explosion was set off consisted of volcanogenic-sedimentary and metamorphosed rocks of the lower part of the Carboniferous system and volcanogenic-metamorphosed and sedimentary rocks of the middle part of the Cambrian system, formed in the Hercynian and Caledonian folding epochs respectively. Figures 1 and 2 show geologic sections of the rock mass -- summary submeridional and more detailed for the shot hole, with an indication of the principal types of rocks. The principal characteristics of the rocks typical for Balapan are represented in Table 1. A number of large and small tectonic dislocations, breaking the bedrock basement down into tectonic blocks of different order (Fig. 3), were discriminated within the limits of the explosion sector. A distinguishing feature of the sector is the presence of a large deep first-order tectonic dislocation (Kolba-Chingiz regional fault). The Kolba-Chingiz fault separates two very large folded systems: Chingiz-Tarbagay meganticlorium formed in the Caledonian epoch of tectogenesis and psephytic rocks of the Middle Cambrian and the Zaysay meganticlinorium of Hercynian age, represented by terrigenous rocks of the Lower Carboniferous. Both systems are characterized by an intensive superposed folding of different periods and the broad development of dislocations of a fault character, predetermining the complex block structure of the considered rock mass. The average width of the fault zone is about 300 m. The fault zone also was traced from the results of magnetic prospecting work with a positive anomaly having an intensity up to 800 nTl. Tectonic dislocations of different order and large fractures are accompanied by fine tectonic fracturing which is manifested in brecciation, schist formation in rocks, presence of slickensides and glide striae, noted in a number of control holes. The span of the tectonic fractures is 1-5 mm. The discriminated tectonic dislocations are accompanied by zones of reduced velocities of propagation of oscillations (Fig. 1). The Chinrauz and Shagan faults with a fault width of several tens of meters with a lower rank are discriminated to the north of the Kolba- Chingiz fault within the limits of the Balapan test site. Their orientation duplicates the strike of the Kolba-Chingiz fault. Fig. 1. The seismic effect of the explosion was investigated in a network of permanent and mobile seismic stations whose location in the Semipalatinsk test site region is represented in Fig. 4. Some of these stations were located in populated places; the others were field stations. The same figure shows the epicenter of the explosion of 8 July 1979, regional faults and boundaries of the Balapan test site in which borehole shots were set off. The epicentral distances to the seismic stations were from 30 to 200 km. Fig. 2. Fig. 3. 1. Registry Method As a rule, in the near seismics zone seismic oscillations are registered by magnetoelectric SM-3 and VEGIK pendulum seismometers with a characteristic period 2 s and an S5S seismometer with a characteristic period 5 s and an attenuation 0.5. The signal from the working winding of the seismic detector, proportional to the velocity of ground oscillations, goes to the input of the unit for shaping characteristic curves having a plateaulike amplitude-frequency curve in the frequency band from 0.5 to 20 Hz. Then the signal in analog form is registered on magnetic tape using a standard compact cassette. The response of such a seismic channel is 10[.sup]4[/] V (m/s)[.sup]-1[/]. The dynamic range of the magnetic recorder with frequency modulation is 38 db. The registered seismograms are processed using an IN-1200 specialized computer having an analog input and a package for processing the seismograms. The seismogram, reduced to digital form, is stored in a winchester or is rewritten on a diskette. A considerable number of seismograms was registered on paper using light-ray oscillographs with galvanometers operating in an aperiodic mode with a high damping factor of about 0.7. The galvanometer channel ensured registry of ground displacements with a magnification up to 1200 and in the same frequency band as the channel for registry of displacement velocity. The dynamic range of the channel is approximately 46 db. The maximum error in determining the amplitude of ground displacement, determined statistically using data from numerous records made using several seismometers of the same type at one seismic station, does not exceed 6%. Some of the seismograms registered during the explosion of 8 July 1989 are represented in Fig. 5. The three components of ground oscillations were registered at most seismic stations: vertical Z, radial horizontal X (direction to explosion epicenter) and tangential horizontal Y. The seismic detectors were mounted (freely, without attachment) on prefabricated concrete pedestals or on bedrock outcrops. Seismic stations (Fig. 4) with the numbers 1-9 were set up on outcrops of weathered bedrock; the others were set up on unconsolidated deposits with a thickness of several tens of meters. Fig. 4. Fig. 5. 2. General Description of Seismic Oscillations In the near seismics zone the general train of oscillations was rather clearly divided into trains of P, S and R waves. The periods of oscillations in the Rayleigh wave are greater by a factor of 4-10 than in body waves. The maximum amplitude of the velocity of oscillations is usually attained in the body waves. The maximum amplitude of the displacements, on the other hand, was in the surface wave. Fig. 6. The trains of oscillations have rather many phases, which is associated with stratification of the real geophysical medium; the influence of the Conrad and Mohorovicic discontinuities stands out very clearly. Figure 6 shows experimental traveltime curves of different phases of seismic oscillations which can be identified with and related to known crustal discontinuities. The P[.sub]1[/] wave is a longitudinal wave refracted in the upper crustal layers. It is traced in the first arrivals to 150 km. Its propagation velocity is from 5.3 to 6.6 km/s. The P[.sub]2[/] wave is a longitudinal wave refracted at the Moho at angles greater than the critical angle. Its amplitude is greatest at epicentral distances 100-130 km; its propagation velocity is from 7.7 to 9.1 km/s. The S[.sub]1[/] and S[.sub]2[/] transverse waves are analogues of the P[.sub]1[/] and P[.sub]2[/] waves. The propagation velocity of S[.sub]1[/] is about 3.1 km/s and that of S[.sub]2[/] is from 3.9 to 5.5 km/s. Beginning at a distance of about 100 km the amplitude of the S wave is maximum in the group of body waves. The surface wave R is a wave of the Rayleigh type. Its group velocity of propagation is 2.75 km/s. It is characterized by polarization in the vertical plane. We note that the constructed traveltime curves are virtually not dependent on the azimuth relative to the explosion epicenter. Table 1.

Explosion Energy The seismic network in the test site region was established for ensuring seismic safety when setting off underground nuclear explosions. In addition, it solves the problem of determining explosion energy. The basis of the method for determining the power of an underground nuclear explosion at the Semipalatinsk test site [17] was the dependence of the maximum displacements W[.sub]R[/][.sup]z[/] and W[.sub]R[/][.sup]x[/] in the surface Rayleigh wave on explosion energy q and epicentral distance R, which is described by the formula: W[.sub]R[/][.sup]z,x[/] = Aq[.sup]0.9[/] R[.sup]-1.4[/] mm, where q is the explosion energy, expressed in kt of TNT, R is the epicentral distance in km. In this dependence A is a coefficient dependent on seismic station i, that is, the station coefficient. The need for introducing station coefficients is illustrated in Fig. 7, where on the rays constructed from the azimuths of the seismic stations dots are plotted for the amplitudes in the Rayleigh wave for the explosion of 8 July 1989, reduced using the epicentral distances, that is, the W[.sub]R[/][.sup]x[/] R[.sup]1.4[/] values. Thus, the attenuation of Rayleigh waves on seismic paths different in distance was taken into account. In actuality, Fig. 7 shows the surface wave radiation diagram. The circle in the figure was constructed with a radius equal to the mean value of the reduced amplitude 44.6 mm km[.sup]1.4[/]. However, as indicated by Fig. 7, the procedure for reducing amplitudes by distance does not transform the Rayleigh wave radiation diagram into an azimuthally symmetric diagram; the deviations of the reduced amplitudes from the mean attain 100% or more. This scatter naturally also persists when computing explosion energy from the amplitude of Rayleigh waves if use is made of the dependence W(q,R) with the single coefficient A, not dependent on the seismic station. (The explosion energy q is virtually proportional to the reduced amplitude W[.sub]R[/] R[.sup]1.4[/]). The introduction of the station coefficients A considerably increases the accuracy in determining explosion energy. The station coefficients for the seismic stations at the test site were determined empirically and are shown in Fig. 8. Their value varies from 3.5 to 12.3. The circle is drawn with a radius equal to the mean value of the station coefficients A = 6.4. The station coefficients and their weighted values were used in computing the explosion energy for the X and Z components of displacements in the Rayleigh wave, which was constructed in the form of the diagram in Fig. 9 demonstrating the dependence of explosion energy on seismic station azimuth. The circle in Fig. 9 was constructed with a radius equal to the mean explosion energy q = 33 kt. The relative error in determining the mean power by this method is 6%. The explosion energy, determined from the amplitude of the surface waves, is close to the 35 kt which was determined by physical methods. The lesser quantity of the mean ``seismic'' energy is possibly related to the condition of positioning of the explosion hypocenter in the zone of the Kolba-Chingiz fault. The station coefficients take into account both the geologic conditions at the registry point and the characteristics of the seismic wave propagation path. When the wave propagation path is examined, it is found that it is necessary to take into account not only the azimuth of wave propagation, but also the place where the explosion epicenter is located. For example, it was noted in [17] that at the Balapan test site three zones with locations of epicenters were discriminated, for which their own sets of station coefficients were introduced. And it is important to note that the boundaries of these zones coincided with the Chinrauz and Shagan tectonic faults which intersect the Balapan test site. Thus, it can be assumed that the station coefficients also reflect the influence of faults and the block structure of the test site on the seismic effect of the explosion. The introduction of station coefficients when solving the problem of determining explosion energy from surface waves in the near seismics zone is similar to the magnitude corrections procedure, which is necessary for determining explosion energy from the magnitude of body waves at teleseismic distances [18, 19]. Fig. 7. Fig. 8. Fig. 9. 4. Propagation of Seismic Waves Across Faults Some of the principal factors determining asymmetry of the complex radiation diagram of a surface wave (Fig. 7) and the values of the station coefficients are the tectonic faults on the wave propagation path, which also form that which we have called the ``characteristics'' of the path. The experimental data registered during the explosion of 8 July 1989 and during a number of explosions set off earlier make it possible to evaluate the influence of the Chinrauz and Shagan faults, located to the north of the epicenter of the explosion of 8 July 1989. This is traced most simply using the parameters of the Rayleigh wave registered on paths intersecting and not intersecting these faults. Figure 10 is a diagrammatic map of the region on which the epicenters of explosions with the numbers 1-6 and seismic stations Nos. 1 and 12, for which the seismograms were analyzed, are plotted. The epicenter with the No. 1 corresponds to the explosion of 8 July 1992. Figure 10 shows that epicenters 1-4 are separated from epicenters 5-6 by the Chinrauz and Shagan faults. For explosions 5-6 the seismic paths at seismic station No. 1 intersect the faults, but for explosions 1-4 they do not intersect the faults. With respect to seismic station No. 12, the situation is directly the opposite. In the remaining details (azimuths of wave propagation, epicentral distances, other faults of a lower rank and inhomogeneities encountered on the wave path) the seismic paths for these explosions are virtually identical. Tables 2 and 3 give the epicentral distances and displacements in the Rayleigh wave at seismic stations Nos. 1 and 12 for six explosions. These data and the power of the explosions were used in computing the reduced wave amplitude W[.sup]*[/] = W[.sub]R[/][.sup]x[/]R[.sup]1.4[/]q[.sup]0.9[/], which also is given in the tables (here, as before, W[.sub]R[/][.sup]x[/] is expressed in mm, q is in kt of TNT and R is in km). The mean reduced amplitude W[.sup]*[/] was computed for experiments 1-4 and 5-6. Table 2 shows that for explosions 5-6 the amplitudes of the waves at point No. 1 on the average is less by a factor of 1.5 than for explosions 1-4. Fig. 10. Fig. 11. This difference can be attributed to the attenuating influence of the Chinrauz and Shagan faults. A similar result can be seen from the data in Table 3. The wave amplitude at station No. 12 for explosions 1-4 on the average is less by a factor of 1.6 than for explosions 5-6. It is natural to assume that here also the reason was wave attenuation during propagation across the Chinrauz and Shagan faults. The attenuating influence of the faults is virtually identical both for explosions 1-4 and for explosions 5-6, that is, is not dependent on the direction of wave propagation across the faults. Fig. 12. The noted effect explains why for the established seismic network in the test site region the Balakan test site was divided into three zones precisely along the Chinrauz and Shagan faults, for each of which their own sets of station coefficients were introduced [17] and demonstrates the contribution of these two faults to the asymmetry of the experimentally registered surface wave radiation pattern. A model of a fault in an ideally elastic medium in the form of a plane slot with an elastic filler was examined in [5, 20]. According to this model the attenuation of the amplitude of a wave propagating across a fault is related to its reflections on the interfaces of media with different acoustic hardness. In particular, for waves close to harmonic, with a characteristic period T and a propagation velocity c with passage across a fault of the width L their amplitude decreases by a factor K = 1 + g[.sup]2[/] [Note: this term is under a radical sign], where the parameter g = �L_g_/cT. Here _g_ = _r_c[.sup]2[/]/_r_[.sub]1[/]c[.sub]1[/][.sup]2[/] is the ratio of the hardness of the rock mass to the hardness of the fault filler, in other words, the fault ``contrast.'' Using the experimental data: attenuation of the amplitude of the Rayleigh wave K = 1.5, its period T = 1 s, propagation velocity c = 2.75 km/s and assuming a common width of the Chinrauz and Shagan faults equal to L = 200 m, we obtain their ``contrast'' _g_ = 5. A subsequent geophysical investigation of these faults makes it possible to obtain reliable information concerning them necessary for computing the propagation of seismic waves across faults. Among the experimental seismograms shown in Fig. 5 the record of tangential horizontal oscillations at seismic stations Nos. 9 and 12 stands out; at these stations the arrival of a transverse wave SH, considerable in amplitude, can be seen very distinctly. This wave is evidence of the release of tectonic energy during an explosion set off on 8 July 1989. Unfortunately, during this explosion the tangential component of oscillations was registered only at an insignificant number of seismic stations and therefore it is impossible to estimate the freed tectonic energy using data for close seismics. 5. Residual Seismic Effects of Underground Nuclear Explosion in Inhomogeneous Medium Aftershocks are some of the most interesting phenomena of a seismic character accompanying an underground nuclear explosion [8, 9, 10]. The aftershocks associated with relaxation processes in the medium are of special interest with respect to description of the behavior and properties of the geophysical medium, and also in monitoring the conducting of underground nuclear explosions [11, 12]. In contrast to the aftershocks caused by the collapse of an unvented cavity, the aftershocks caused by medium relaxation are characterized for the most part by small amplitudes and a short duration [10]. These aftershocks are observed over a prolonged period after an explosion, which is especially important when organizing the monitoring of nuclear explosions (on-the-spot inspection) because the monitoring side in this case has adequate time for organizing observations in the selected territory.

Instrumental observations were made using a small-aperture seismic registry network and instrument complexes described in detail in [10, 12]. First, for the purpose of obtaining the comparative characteristics of pulsed microseismic effects of the wave type constantly present in the real geophysical medium, seismic registry was carried out for the two weeks preceding the explosion. After the underground nuclear explosion was set off constant operational seismic observations were made over the course of three months. The measurements were made at nighttime when the technogenic effects on the geophysical medium were minimum. Figure 11 shows characteristic records of a pulsed microseismic effect in the medium before the explosion and aftershock. A comparison of pulsed effects of natural origin (before the explosion) and those initiated by the explosion reveals their qualitative similarity, which makes it possible to postulate an identity of sources, and accordingly, an identity of the mechanisms of radiation of pulsed oscillations. The discrimination of pulsed microseismic signals against a background of natural microseismic oscillations was made in an automatic mode on the basis of computation and comparison of the dispersion relations in narrow and broad time windows, and also using frequency selection. The optimum filter was chosen by means of spectral-temporal analysis. The method was applied by making a moving evaluation of the intensity of seismic oscillations in different frequency ranges. In this case the useful pulsed signal corresponded to a region of increased dispersion values, which determined the frequency range and the position of the signal on the time axis (Fig. 12). The range finding (determination of coordinates) of pulsed microseismic effects of the wave type was accomplished using one of two standard methods: on the basis of a correlation analysis of the oscillations registered at spatially separated seismic stations and an analysis of the records registered at a central three-component registry point and at peripheral single-component registry points. An analysis of the seismic records made prior to the explosion shows that the number of pulsed microseismic oscillations of natural origin distinguishable using the employed methods in the explosion region of interest to us [See Footnote 1] with a relative radius of 1000 m/kt[.sup]1/3[/] [4] did not exceed 1.4 per hour (as an average for the 49 hours of registry the relative number of signals was 1.08 1/hour). The rms amplitude of the natural signals in the frequency range 5-10 Hz did not exceed 0.3 �m/s. The horizontal spatial distribution of their foci is virtually uniform (Fig. 13) and the depth does not exceed 300 m. One notes the fact that the signals characterized by a great amplitude are grouped closer to the body of a deep fault. Fig. 13. FIG. 14. Fig. 15. Fig. 16. In the analysis of the aftershocks of an underground explosion only pulsed signals with an amplitude exceeding 0.4 �m/s were taken into account. It was assumed that in the first approximation in this way it is possible to discriminate seismic effects initiated by an explosion. Figure 14 shows the intensity distribution of aftershock emission with time. The determined dependence N(t), where N is the number of aftershocks per unit time, t is time from the moment of the explosion, representable in the form: N(t) = 2228t[.sup]-1[/] hour[.sup]-1[/] when 200 < t < 2000 hours (1) It must be noted that the experimentally determined dependence (1) corresponds to the known temporal distribution of aftershocks of natural and technogenic earthquakes (Omori frequency of recurrence law [13]). The data represented in Fig. 14 demonstrate the impairment of the monotonic character of the dependence N(t) on the 18th day after the explosion (in Fig. 14 this place is designated by an arrow). A more detailed analysis indicated that this can be attributed to an anomalous change in atmospheric pressure on 27 July 1989. As an illustration, Fig. 15 jointly shows a graph of the change in atmospheric pressure P in the region where seismic observations were made with time and the relative value of the deviation _D_N(t) of the number of aftershocks registered per unit time from the averaged dependence N(t), designated in Fig. 14 by a solid line. Figure 15 clearly shows that both dependencies _D_N(t) and P(t) correlate well with one another. The intensity of aftershock emission drops with an increase in atmospheric pressure and clearly increases with its decrease. The lag in the _D_N change is about a half- day. The noted correlation between relaxation processes and a change in atmospheric pressure is consistent with the earlier discovered correlation between deformation processes in the geophysical medium and atmospheric pressure variations [14]. The law of frequency of recurrence of aftershocks has the nature of the Gutenberg-Richter dependence (lgN = const[.sub]1[/] - bM, where M is the magnitude of the seismic event [15]) and is representable in the form (Fig. 16): lg N = 1.6 - 1.1 lg A, where A is the amplitude of the aftershocks in �m/s. The value of the b parameter retrieved using the relation lgE = 11.8 + 1.5M (where E = Const[.sub]2[/]A[.sup]2[/] is the energy of a seismic event in erg [16]) in our case is 0.83. The spatial distribution of the foci of aftershocks is of fundamental interest with respect to the influence of the structural organization of the rock mass on the seismic effects of an explosion. As it appears, the presence of a well-developed deep fault results in a considerable spatially nonuniform distribution of aftershock foci. Figures 17 and 18 show the distribution of the foci of aftershocks of the investigated explosion in azimuth and depth. It can be seen clearly that the overwhelming majority of aftershock foci were concentrated in the structural block in which the explosion was set off. A deep fault is clearly manifested in the form of some boundary beyond which the relaxation processes initiated by an explosion transpire considerably less intensively. This means that the fault impedes transfer of the energy of the explosion event, as a result of which in a structural block separated from the explosion first of all there is no additional reserve of elastic energy, and second of all, the disturbance from the explosion is insufficiently great for initiating the freeing of the tectonic energy initially present in the medium.
