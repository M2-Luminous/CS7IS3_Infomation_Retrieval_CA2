FR940404-2-00044 FR940404-2-00034 Background The Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products (other than automobiles) was established pursuant to the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, Public Law 94&hyph;163, 89 Stat. 917, amended by the National Energy Conservation Policy Act, Public Law 95&hyph;619, 92 Stat. 3266, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987, Public Law 100&hyph;12, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988, Public Law 100&hyph;357, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;486, 106 Stat. 2776, which requires DOE to prescribe standardized test procedures to measure the energy consumption of certain consumer products, including clothes washers. The intent of the test procedures is to provide a comparable measure of energy consumption that will assist consumers in making purchasing decisions. These test procedures appear at 10 CFR part 430, subpart B. DOE amended the prescribed test procedures by adding 10 CFR 430.27 on September 26, 1980, creating the waiver process (45 FR 64108). Thereafter, DOE further amended the appliance test procedure waiver process to allow the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Assistant Secretary) to grant an Interim Waiver from test procedure requirements to manufacturers that have petitioned DOE for a waiver of such prescribed test procedures (51 FR 42823, November 26, 1986). The waiver process allows the Assistant Secretary to temporarily waive the test procedures for a particular basic model when a petitioner shows that the basic model contains one or more design characteristics which prevent testing according to the prescribed test procedures or when the prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic model in a manner so unrepresentative of its true energy consumption as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data. Waivers generally remain in effect until final test procedure amendments become effective, resolving the problem that is the subject of the waiver. The Interim Waiver provisions, added by the 1986 amendment, allow the Assistant Secretary to grant an Interim Waiver when it is determined that the applicant will experience economic hardship if the Application for Interim Waiver is denied, if it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted, and/or the Assistant Secretary determines that it would be desirable for public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determination on the Petition for Waiver. An Interim Waiver remains in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE issues its determination on the Petition for Waiver, whichever is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180 days, if necessary. Pursuant to ยง430.27(g), the Assistant Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register notice of each waiver granted, and any limiting conditions of each waiver.
