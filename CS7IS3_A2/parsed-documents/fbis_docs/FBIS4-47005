In reality, only Edict No. 1007, "On Repealing Quotas and Licenses on Exports of Goods and Services" (the shortest of them all--only half a page), may lay claim to being called radical, since it essentially removes the last direct administrative restrictions on the movement of Russian goods--this time in the sphere of international trade. The edict becomes effective on 1 July, which means that, beginning in the second half of 1994, all the goodness the bureaucrats derived from granting quotas, licenses, and preferences in custom duty taxation is out; naturally, the beneficiaries will be the Ministry of Finance and the budget, whose revenue part until now has been in inverse proportion to the go-getting power of exporters and regional administrations. Liberalization of foreign trade should bring about the end of the omnipotent "nontariff regulation," and the volume of exports of goods and services will depend on the commercial effectiveness of the exports and the size of export duty, which, in turn, increases the role of the customs. It is unlikely that we will see a violent reaction of the world markets on liberalization of Russian exports. Some of them (aluminum and uranium) already are protected from an unpredictable increase in Russian exports by corresponding agreements, and Edict No. 1007 reaffirms obligations in this respect. As to other raw material exports (first and foremost, oil), it is impossible to increase their exports overnight because of transport limitations. The "anti-theft" Decree on the Reform of State Enterprises is more of a declaration of the state's intent to control the utilization of property that belongs to it, but certainly not an immediate introduction of the institution of treasury-owned property. By the way, the draft document was prepared a long time ago and had not been signed--not the least because of resistance by Anatoliy Chubays, who apparently detected that treasury-owned economic entities represent a method of reforming state property as an alternative to privatization. As to the remaining three financial-monetary edicts, there is nothing "reformist" in them, since the subject is a routine change in tax rates, combating tax evasion, and improvements in money clearing. Such documents, which clearly are below the status of presidential decrees, have been, are, and will be issued every time the government (the Ministry of Finance or the Central Bank) makes a decision to change tax parameters or the mechanism for legal entities to settle accounts with the budget and among themselves. These documents will get into the orbit of Yeltsin and his administration's attention only in the event the president once again "discovers" economic problems that are well-known to the majority of the population. The utility of periodic splashes of the head of the state's interest in the economy is unquestionable--the needed documents are signed without delay and get the highest status. Compared to this, the costs in the form of canceled official visits (this time, Aleksandr Shokhin's to Seoul) and additional apparat hustle seem minimal.
